One of the possible explanations for this is the increasing importance of obtaining research funding. Women are often less successful in this than men. Psychology researchers Dr. Romyvan der Lee and professor Naomi Ellemers investigated whether this difference also occurs at the Netherlands Organisation for Scientific Research (NWO) and examined potential explanations. The researchers were assigned by NWO to carry out this study as part of the broader evaluation of NWO's procedures and its gender diversity policy. The aim was to gain more insight into the causes of the differences in awarding rates for male and female applicants for research funding. The analysis addressed an important \"talent programme\" of NWO, the Veni grant. \"Whoever receives this grant has a greater chance of obtaining an important appointment at a university,\"says Naomi Ellemers. Van der Lee and Ellemers investigated all the applications submitted by male and female researchers over a period of three years: a total of 2823 applications. Under the direction of NWO these applications were assessed by scientific committees consisting of men and women. The results demonstrate that the awarding rates for female applicants (14.9%) are systematically lower than those for male applicants (17.7%). \"If we compare the proportion of women among the applicants with the proportion of women among those awarded funding, we see a loss of 4%,\" said Ellemers. The study reveals that women are less positively evaluated for their qualities as researcher than men are. \"Interestingly the research proposals of women and men are evaluated equally positively. In other words, the reviewers see no difference in the quality of the proposals that men and women submit,\" says Romy van der Lee. In search for a possible cause for the differences in awarding rates and evaluations, the researchers also investigated the language use in the instructions and forms used to assess the quality of applications. This clearly revealed the occurrence of gendered language. The words that are used to indicate quality are frequently words that were established in previous research as referring mainly to the male gender stereotype (such as challenging and excellent).

The piece of technology in question would be smart, able to tell you about the weather and where the nearest restaurants are. The good thing is you no longer need to wonder, because something like this already exists. And its name is Siri. Siri is a voice recognition application designed for Apple products and the concept has been around for almost a year. When Siri first came out it could only speak English, but now it has \"learned\" lots of new languages, including Chinese, Cantonese and Taiwanese, reported The Wall Street Journal. So, you can give it orders in your mother tongue. But how could a cell phone or a computer \"hear\" what you are saying and understand it? This is all because of voice recognition technology. When you speak, your voice creates vibrations   in the air - a bit like waves in the water when you throw a rock into the lake. The microphone receives the vibrations and the computer changes them into digital data that is then divided into many parts. They are analyzed one by one to see what pronunciations each part stands for. The computer then puts these pronunciations together into possible words according to its built-in dictionary. But figuring out the words is far from enough; building words into meaningful sentences is the most difficult part. The computer has to compare what it hears to a large library of known phrases and sentences to determine what the user is saying. However, people don't always talk in the most standard way and sometimes make grammatical mistakes. This is why traditional voice recognition software always requires you to remember keywords and to speak in a certain way. Fortunately, Siri isn't like that.

His research achievements have advanced the development of remote sensing science, and made China one of the leaders in this field. He also received several famous science prizes from China. He published 1,878 essays on his blog since 2007. All his students have thumbed up to Li for his contributions to the development of remote sensing. He was known to everyone in the remote sensing circle, but was impressive on citizens for a photo. In recent years, Professor Li's quiet and self-effacing behavior was recognized through social media. In 2014, a photograph of Academician Li was taken by his student, in which he was attentively making a lecture with shabby clothes, grizzled hair and straggling beard, without socks, and wearing black cloth shoes. He looked like an old villager, rather than a famous scientist. The photo became popular on the Internet and earned him the title of the \"Cloth Shoes Academician.\" His simple plain image, kindness to all his students and dedication to his career are three important features on him. All these are precious to educational and academic community. \"The society is changeable but Academician Li is quiet. He faced all stuff with his characters of quietness and simplicity. It is clear that he has become the 'Teacher Immortal'.\" said Ge Yuejing, a senior leader of Beijing Normal University. Which statement is TRUE according to the passage?", "subject": ""}

The invaders are plants brought here from other countries to make gardens and yards look pretty. Ever since people started to arrive on America's shores, they have carried along trees, flowers, and vegetables from other places. Now there are so many of those plants, they are crowding out the native plants that have lived here since before human settlers arrived. And that's a problem, says Dr. Doug Tallamy. He's insect expert at the University of Delaware. He explains that almost all the plant-eating insects in the United States are specialized, which means they eat only certain plants. Monarch butterfly caterpillars ,for example, dine on milkweed. If people cut down milkweed and replace it with another plant, the butterflies will not have the food source that they need to survive. But the trouble doesn't stop there. When insects can't get the right plants to eat and they die off, then the birds don't have enough bugs for their meals. Tallamy points out that almost all migrating birds depend on insets to feed their young. \"We cannot let the plants and animals around us disappear.\" says Tallamy, \"The way to preserve them is to give them food to eat. But when we plant non-native plants, we are _ the food chain, because then we don't have the insects the birds need to live.\" Fewer of the right plants mean fewer bugs, and fewer bugs mean fewer birds. And that's bad for the Earth, because we need a variety of living things to keep the planet healthy and beautiful.

The researchers point out that warmer temperatures and changing habitats, caused by climate change, are possible reasons for the shrinking of creatures. \"We do not yet know the exact mechanisms involved, or why some organisms are getting smaller while others are unaffected,\" the researchers said. \"Until we understand more, we could be risking negative consequences that we can't yet quantify.\" The change was big in cold-blooded animals. Only two decades of warmer temperatures were enough to make reptiles  smaller. An increase of only 1degC caused nearly a 10 percent increase in metabolism . Greater use of energy resulted in tiny tortoises and little lizards. Fish are smaller now too. Though overfishing has played a part in reducing numbers, experiments show that warmer temperatures also stop fish growth. There is a recent report on warmer temperatures' negative effects on plankton ,the base of the marine ecosystem. Warm-blooded animals weren't immune from the size change caused by climate change. Many birds are now smaller; Mammals have been miniaturized too. Soay sheep are thinner. Red deer are weaker. And polar bears are smaller, compared with historical records. This isn't the first time this has happened in Earth's history. 55 million years ago, a warming event similar to the current climate change caused bees, spiders and ants to shrink by 50 to 75 percent over several thousand years.

{"answer": 2, "choices": ["She got scared.", "She saw a mouse.", "A thief broke into the house.", "The doors were unlocked."], "question": "Rhubarb loved everyone and every dog. Whenever someone came to the house, she was always happy. We had an older Samoyed named Willie, and it was important that Rhubarb got along well with him. She wanted to play, but was very respectful of Willie and left him alone when he was tired and needed to rest. Willie was not well and died about a year later, but I believe Rhubarb's interaction helped him keep going for longer than ifhe had been alone. But the interesting thing about Rhubarb was that she never barked. She would sometimes get excited when she saw a mouse and make a little crying sound. One hot night when she was about 4 years old, we went to bed with the windows open and the doors unlocked. At about 3 a.m., I woke up to the sound of Rhubarb barking and growling. I woke Donald and we got out of bed. Rhubarb was coming toward us with her hackles  up. We turned on the lights and noticed the door to the kitchen was open. Then we saw the door leading into the house from the garage was also open. We quickly locked all the doors, and we did not get any sleep that night. The next day I called the police to report a break-in. I told them nothing had been taken, but they sent a police officer over to talk with us anyway. While he was here, we found out several local homes had been burglarized over the weekend. Most people had their wallets and purses stolen. My purse was right next to the door, but Rhubarb had scared the robber away before he or she could steal it. When the police officer left, he said we should keep our doors locked and reward Rhubarb with a big steak dinner. Rhubarb lived to be almost 12, but that night was the only time she barked in her entire life. Fortunately, she never saw the need to warn us of any other danger.

The two islands have plenty of floating grass and various schools of fish, offering rich food sources for birds. The islands have become a paradise for different kinds of groups of birds and have been called 'Bird Islands'. Each March and April, when ice and snow covering the Qinghai-Tibet Plateau starts to melt, over 20 kinds of birds fly to the Bird Islands to lay eggs. During the months, flocks of birds cover the whole sky over the islands and birds eggs can be found everywhere. Visitors can hear the singing of birds from miles away. These have become a world famous symbol of the lake.

Robert Levine and his colleagues have studied the speed of life in cities around the world and across the U.S. In a series of experiments they measured how fast a single pedestrian in a downtown center covered a distance of 60 feet, timed how long it took to complete a simple commercial transaction, and recorded the accuracy of randomly selected clocks in the downtown business area. They found that places with a faster pace of life also had stronger economies, and that people in larger cities tended to move faster than those in less populated areas.     So as you might expect, fast-moving people are associated with fast-moving economies. But does that faster life translate into greater happiness? In faster places, people were more likely to smoke, less likely to take the time to help strangers in need, and more likely to die from heart diseases. Yet Levine and his colleagues found that people in faster places tended to report feeling somewhat happier with their lives than those who lived in slower places. A city's pace of life was indeed \"significantly related\" to the physical, social, and psychological well-being of its inhabitants.     However, the relationship between income and reported happiness is far from obvious. According to the \"Easterlin paradox(,)\" (named after economist Richard Easterlin), once people have enough money to meet their basic needs, having more money is not necessarily correlated with higher self-reported happiness. Easterlin's claims are controversial and not universally accepted; even if his theory is correct, wealthier nations might be happier overall if they address the basic needs to more of their people. In any case, the ongoing debate indicates that we need to be careful when making connections between happiness and overall economic factors.     Among individuals in a society, busyness -- or the feeling of busyness -- seems to be an important factor in well-being. That feeling of busyness -- of having a lot to do and too little time in which to do it is often associated with stress and anxiety. However in many contexts being \"busy\" is badge of honor: Busy parents are seen as devoted to their children's well-being and the busy lawyer can charge a premium hourly rate. In US studies, the happiest people reported that they were busy, in the sense that they had little excess time, yet did not feel rushed.     Levine's work raises the possibility that an individual's feelings about their use of time contribute as much or more to their happiness as does economics. Now the big challenge is to find out which way the causal chain works: Does the feeling of being active, yet not rushed, contribute to happiness? Or does happiness allow people to perceive  their use of time in positive ways? What can we learn about Levine's study?", "subject": ""}

I wonder why you keep it and take it wherever you go.\" I smiled, \"it means a great deal to me.\" I simply gave her my shortest answer. Honestly speaking, I, either, could not understand the reason why I kept it. Then all of a sudden, fallen leaves darkened my eyes with a strong wind. I grabbed the umbrella instinctively. The rain poured down. Thanks to my umbrella, I didn't get wet at all. \"Why have I kept it for so long?\" I asked myself, staring at my umbrella. I couldn't remember when and where I bought it, for I'm always tired and lazy to answer questions. It could protect me from the heavy rain, I told myself eventually. Looking at the people rushing through the street, I felt safe. This might be another reason. It is always so. We know a thunderstorm comes unexpectedly and goes without a warning. The sky cleared up. The sun shone brightly. Just as usual, I seized the umbrella with my left hand. Still there's water dropping down. I walked among the noisy crowd and listened to what they were murmuring in their heart. \"Today I will ask for a rise, or I'll leave this company.\" Good luck to you, I smiled to him. \"I'll manage to make you live forever.\" A little boy held a pet dog close to him. \"She'll be all right, because she is blessed.\" I heard angels singing in this city. The moment my fingertips touched the umbrella, I felt it's dry, and it's warm. Soon it became hot. I held it up to avoid harmful sunshine. Do I need a reason to explain why? Maybe I should think about it. I need my umbrella when it is sunny as well as when it is rainy. What's the most suitable title for the passage?", "subject": ""}

Helping them get involved in volunteering opportunities is the perfect way for them to open up that world and give their time to a good cause.

If they have to travel a long distance to volunteer, it's less likely to be accomplished. My son has helped with the local library's reading program for two summers. It is close to home and the schedule is very elastic. We go in and choose days that work with his schedule and he volunteers for about 2 hours at a time. He is responsible for helping kids get signed up for the summer reading program and helping them record the hours they read. It is only a one-week time commitment, but it is very rewarding. When teens volunteer they often see that there are others more needy than themselves. They also learn time management. Your teen will become a more rounded, less self-centred individual. Colleges see thousands of students applying for admission every year. If your teen has shown the devotion to volunteer in the community, it can give him the advantage for college admission or scholarship opportunities.

He walks out of the store with milk. That is all-milk. At the same time, a woman enters the same grocery store also to buy milk. She buys it. But she also buys chicken and lemons to make dinner that night. Then she remembers to buy food for her son to eat at school. She also gets a bottle of wine for drinks with friends and a birthday card for her husband's niece. Then she gets coffee for breakfast, ice cream for dessert and remembers stamps to mail the bills. And don't forget soap for the bathroom. And that is the difference between the female and male brains simply explained in a grocery store. Generally speaking, men do one thing at a time. Women do many. Now scientific research supports this theory about male and female brains. A recent study has confirmed what we have known all along--men and women think differently. Scientists at the University of Pennsylvania studied brain images of 949 people aged from eight to 22 years old. They found that male brains have more connections on one side of the brain, or hemisphere. In the female brains, they found more activity and connections between the right and left sides of the brain. The left side of the brain is known as the side of \"reason.\" The right hemisphere is known as the \"creative\" side. Regina Verma is a professor at the University of Pennsylvania. She co-wrote the report. She says when women are asked to do something difficult they might use different parts of the brain. Men, she adds, generally use just one side of the brain. As a result, men generally deal directly with a problem. There is a strong connection between the \"understanding\" and the \"action\" parts of their brains. Women, however, might include other parts of the brain when solving a problem. Women take a less direct path to find a solution. What causes the difference between men's and women's behavior?", "subject": ""}

The scientists found that population of large fish like tuna; swordfish and cod have dropped by ninety percent in the past fifty years. The study took ten years. The researchers gathered records from fishing businesses and governments around the world. The magazineNaturepublished the findings. The scientists say the common method called longline fishing is especially damaging to populations of large fish. This method involves many fishing lines connected to one boat. These wires can be close to one-hundred kilometers long. They hold thousands of sharp metal hooks to catch fish. Longline fishing is especially common in the Japanese fishing industry. Records showed that Japanese boats used to catch about ten fish for every one-hundred hooks. The study says longline fishing boats now might catch one fish per hundred hooks. The scientists say industrial fishing can destroy groups of fish much faster than in the past. The study suggests that whole populations can disappear almost completely from new fishing areas within ten to fifteen years. Ransom Myers of Dalhousie University in Nova Scotia led the study with Boris Worm of Dalhousie and the University of Kiel in Germany. Mister Worm says the destruction could lead to a complete re-organization of ocean life systems. Mister Meyers says the decreased number of large fish is not the only worry.

Since then, our staff have received lots of calls from parents asking for more information about it. Here is a memo   for your reference when you answer the phones. Sports 1: Basketball. We expect that this will be the most popular of the four sports. Therefore, students should be advised to sign up as soon as possible. Students will take a private bus to and from Kwun Tong Sports Park .To cover the cost of hiring a bus , each student will have to pay $10 each time. There will be four basketball courts available for our use with one teacher watching over each game. Sports 2: Gym We will be using St. Peter's Memorial Park. There are two reasons for choosing this park. First, it is not very busy and crowded before 6:00 pm. Second, it has lot of trees with plenty of shade. Students must bring along two bottles of water to prevent thirst. Three activities, skipping , jogging , outdoor aerobics  ,all of which are free of charge, will be arranged. And there will be a teacher on duty for each of the activities. Sports 3: Hiking Hiking will take place at Kowloon Peak. The activity will start at 2:30 pm and finish 90 minutes later. Three teachers will accompany the students, and a hiking instructor will accompany each group of 15 hikers . Each instructor will cost $75/hr. Students are advised to bring plenty of water and sunscreen. Sports 4: Swimming The Kowloon City Aquatic Centre is a 10-minute walk from our school. Four teachers will go to the pool and conduct the goings-on from the poolside. We will only be able to reserve the pool for one hour (i.e. 2:45pm to 3:45pm).Only students skilful at swimming can take up this activity. The pool will have two lifeguards present.

The best way to build a good vocabulary, therefore, is to read a great deal and to participate in a lot of good talks. There are relatively few words that we learn permanently by purposefully referring to dictionaries or keeping word lists. However, even those extra few are of value, and no one will make a mistake by working on developing a larger vocabulary. Here are some suggestions of how to do it. Read plenty of good books. When you come across a new word, or a new meaning of an old word, stop and see if you can understand it from its context. If you can't, and if you can manage without interrupting the thought of the book too much, look it up in a dictionary or ask somebody and then repeat its meaning to yourself a couple of times. If you are really conscientious , write the word and its meaning in a personal vocabulary list - preferably using it in a sentence, or you can keep a special vocabulary notebook.

They dragged an unconscious little boy, who went to start the fire in the old-fashioned coal stove to heat, out of the flaming building more dead than alive. He had major burns over the lower half of his body and was taken to a nearby county hospital. From his bed the dreadfully burned, semi-conscious little boy faintly heard the doctor talking to his mother. The doctor told his mother that her son would surely die -- which was for the best, really -- for the terrible fire had ruined the lower half of his body. But the brave boy didn't want to die. He made up his mind that he would survive. Somehow, to the amazement of the physician, he did survive. When the deadly danger was past, he again heard the doctor and his mother speaking quietly. The mother was told that since the fire had destroyed so much flesh in the     lower part of his body, it would almost    be better if he had died, since he was doomed to be in a wheelchair all lifetime with no use at all of his lower limbs  . Once more the brave boy made up his mind. He would not be a disabled man. He would walk. But unfortunately from the waist    down, he had no motor ability. His thin legs just hung there, all but lifeless. Ultimately he was released from the hospital. Every day his mother would massage his little legs, but there was no feeling, no control, nothing. Yet his determination that he would walk was as strong as ever. When he wasn't in bed, he was confined to a wheelchair. One sunny day his mother wheeled him out into the yard to get some fresh air. This day, instead of sitting there, he threw himself from the chair. He pulled himself across the grass, dragging his legs  behind him. He worked his way to the white fence bordering their lot. With great effort, he raised himself up on the fence. Then he began dragging himself along the fence,resolved that he would walk.

High school was hard, because everyone wanted to have nice clothes, hang out, drive cars, and all these cost money. Peter's father was the sort of guy that believed you had to earn whatever you got, so he wasn't just about to hand over lots of money for Peter to use to have fun. So, he had to get a job. During his freshman year summer vacation, his classmate got him a job working on a hay   farm. He threw hay up into wagons as the tractor drove around fields, and then they stacked   it in the hot barn. It was a hot, lowpaying job. He once worked a few nights a week at a grocery store. He put things on the shelf. It was a lot of lifting and carrying, and his arms were strong from this and the previous job. It was dull and didn't pay much. He took some time off when soccer got serious, but the following summer he tried working at a lumber yard. It was hot outside, but he got a lot of exercise lifting and carrying things like boards and drywall. He also learned a lot about building supplies. It still didn't pay well. From there, he spent a year doing some tutoring for a friend of the family, but that was piecemeal. His first real job came the last year at school, when he fixed registers and worked on computers at a big box store. It was his favorite job yet, but it still didn't pay well. What Peter realized with all of these jobs was that he needed a better paying job! The only way to get that was to get trained or educated. He could go to school and get a 2year degree in an office or technical position. His other choices were going to a 4year college or joining the army.

For two years I learned English using the method described above. My English was improving but I was still forgetting new words. Finally, in the fourth grade I got closer to Michael, who started to show me how to learn English more efficiently, which was a breakthrough in the whole process of my learning English. Michael encouraged me to read books in English with monolingual dictionaries. Several months later, I began to write e-mail messages in English. I have been using these techniques for four years, and in my opinion, I have achieved pretty good results. What is the most important thing in the author's process of English learning?", "subject": ""}

The show features three families who move in and out of each other's lives. The first one is a typical American family: the working dad Phil, stay-at-home mom Claire and their three children. The second family is made up of Jay, his young Hispanic wife and her son Manny. Jay, 65, is the father of Claire.

You might watch and laugh when your dog chases its tail because it looks cute. But did you know that, even though it might appear like a fun game, it could mean your pet is sick? Researchers have found that if a dog runs after its tail, chases cars and barks  at flies that are not there, it may have obsessive compulsive disorder (OCD, ). In fact, OCD is even more common among humans. The symptoms   are varied: some people check and recheck the locks before they go out; others are extremely afraid of germs   and have to wash their hands many times a day. English soccer star David Beckham, for example, cannot stand odd numbers   of items in his fridge. So if he has three cans of drink he will throw one out, according to his wife Victoria. Hoping to better understand OCD in humans, a team of scientists from the University of Helsinki, Finland, studied 368 dogs, including those that chase their tail for several hours daily or a few times a month, according to Sciencedaily.com. They also examined dogs that had never chased their tails. Scientists took the dogs' blood sample   and asked their owners some questions about their pets' daily life. Findings showed that among all kinds of dogs, bull terriers   and German shepherds   were likely to chase their tails, which led scientists to believe that genes   can cause OCD. Diet also plays a part. It was found that dogs that eat food with certain vitamins and minerals chased their tails less. \"Interestingly, there are indications   that vitamins and minerals are helpful in human OCD treatment,\" said researcher Katriina Tiira. Moreover, tail-chasing is often found among dogs that were separated from their mothers too early or ones that didn't receive enough care. They are also more likely to turn out to be shyer and more afraid of loud noises at a young age.

They form a natural border between Zimbabwe   and Zambia  . The falls are named after Queen Victoria by Livingstone. They were known to the native people in the 18th century as: \"the smoke that thunders\". The waterfall is formed as the two-kilometer-wide Zambezi River spills   over the edge of its giant stone riverbed and falls into the gorge   below. At their highest point, the Victoria Falls drop a distance of 108m, almost twice as far as the Niagara Falls. As much as 546 million cubic meters of water per minute falls over the edge from that height. Viewing the falls from the Zambian side means that visitors can follow a path that goes right up to the falls. The falls can also be viewed from the Boiling Pot, right in the depths of the gorge at the bottom of the falls. The 111-meter-high Victoria Falls Bridge, a railway crossing, is now a popular place for Bungee jumping. It can be crossed on foot for excellent views of the falls and the winding blue-green waters of the Zambezi River. It is also possible to see the falls from a plane.

While cats are predators, they are also easy to get attacked from larger animals, such as dogs or even other cats. A tree often provides a safe hiding place. In the wild, cars climb up trees to give them a resting or napping place that is out of predators' range. It also helps disguise their presence. Some cats may climb trees for fun, on occasion, or possibly to work on improving their climbing abilities.

Climbing practice is good for cats; it can improve their strength and flexibility and teach them an important defensive skill.

Interestingly, due to some of their physical features, cats will meet trouble getting down from the trees after climbing up, which may seem unusual. There are several reasons why cats climb trees, mostly to do with defensive purposes. Cats, as predators , like to understand their environment well. As they are small animals, their scope of vision is considerably smaller. Cats often climb trees to get a better view of their surroundings to help them see any potential dangers. While cats are predators, they are also easy to get attacked from larger animals, such as dogs or even other cats. A tree often provides a safe hiding place. In the wild, cars climb up trees to give them a resting or napping place that is out of predators' range. It also helps disguise their presence. Some cats may climb trees for fun, on occasion, or possibly to work on improving their climbing abilities. Small cats frequently test out their claw skills by trying to climb up anything and everything, from bookcases to trees to a person's leg. Climbing practice is good for cats; it can improve their strength and flexibility and teach them an important defensive skill. If a cat has gotten up a tree and cannot get down, the owner may wonder why its remarkable climbing abilities only work in one direction. A cat's claws curve inward, allowing it to grip onto surfaces while going up head first. Unfortunately, this useful climbing curve does nothing to help the animal get back down again. Eventually, most trapped cats will either jump out of the tree or realize that they can get down by going tail first.

Well, the story begins with Thomas Hopkins Gallaudet. Gallaudet met his neighbor's daughter Alice Cogswell. Alice was the young deaf daughter of Dr. Mason Cogswell from Hartford, Connecticut. Gallaudet began teaching Alice to read and write a few simple words. Excited by the success Dr. Cogswell encouraged Gallaudet to establish a school for the deaf. Cogswell raised the money and Gallaudet traveled to Britain to learn the methods used there. However, the schools refused to share their instructional techniques and methods. While in London, there happened to be a demonstration of the French method of deaf education. Britain was using an oral method of instruction; however, the French method used signs. Gallaudet was fascinated with the method and was able to meet with the instructor, Sicard, and his two deaf pupils, Jean Massieu and Laurent Clerc.

The cat then decided to make all serve her in her wise way. To carry out her design, she climbed to the nest of the eagle, saying, \"Destruction is preparing for you and for me too, unfortunately. The wild pig, whom you see daily digging up the earth, wishes to uproot the tree, so she may on its fall seize our families as food for her young.\" Having thus frightened the eagle out of her senses, she crept down to the cave of the pig, saying, \"Your children are in great danger, for as soon as you go out to find food, the eagle is prepared to jump upon one of your little pigs.\" Having filled these fears into the pig, she went and pretended to hide herself in the hollow of the tree. When night came she went out silently and obtained food for herself and her children, but pretending to be afraid, she kept a lookout all through the day. Meanwhile, the eagle, full of fear of the pig, sat still on the branches, and the pig, terrified by the eagle, did not dare to go out from her cave. Thus they both, along with their families, starved from hunger, and afforded good food for the cat and her children. How did the cat get what she wanted?", "subject": ""}

Perhaps some of the job offers they have received are below their skill and experience levels. Is it better to take these offers, or reject them and remain unemployed? Recently, David Pedulla, a University of Texas sociologist, conducted a study about how taking a job below your skill level could affect your future employment. In the study, Pedulla developed resumes for imaginary job applicants. The job seekers he created had a few things in common. They had a college degree, worked nearly two years at their first job, and about 4.5 years at their second job. What differed was their third job in the most recent year. They either had a full-time job that matched their skills, a part-time job below their skill levels, or were unemployed. Then Pedulla submitted 2,420 resumes based on his imaginary job seekers, along with cover letters, to online ads for 1,210 real jobs. Each applicant had a real phone number that employers could contact if they were interested in talking with the applicant further. The callback rates varied widely based on how the imaginary job seekers had spent their last year. The applicants who had full-time jobs the previous year were called back 10.4 percent of the time. Those whose most recent year of employment was in a job below their skill levels were only called back about 5 percent. Male applicants unemployed for a year were called back 4.2 percent of the time, while the figure is 7.5 percent for unemployed females.

Is the sound lounder in its right ear or left ear? Does the upper or lower ear detect the sound first? The information helps the owl find the location of its prey without ever seeing it. Owls don't depend just on their hearing to hunt. After a sound draws an owl's attention, it zeroes in with sight. Many birds have eyes on either side of their heads. But an owl's eyes face forward, like a person's. Images from each eye combine to form a 3-D picture, similar to how we see. That helps owls better judge a prey's size, distance, and speed.

Images from each eye combine to form a 3-D picture, similar to how we see. That helps owls better judge a prey's size, distance, and speed. An owl's eyes are so large that they can gather lots of light. That helps the owl see better when hunting at night. An owl's eyes are also fixed in their sockets . It can't roll them like we can. Instead, an owl keeps prey in its sight by turning its head. Owls can move their beads nearly upside down and turn them 270 degrees around. Their necks have 14 vertebrae . That's twice as many neck bones as a person has. The blood vessels  thread through holes in an owl's vertebrae. The researchers found that these holes are very large so that the extra space provides an air cushion that protects the vessels. Detecting prey is only the first step for owls. Next they must catch their meals. An owl can fly inches over your head and you can't hear anything. The secret to owls' silent flight is their feathers. Fine \"hairs\" cover the surface of an owl's wing feathers. And the feathers' edges have soft barbs . Together, they make the sound of air rushing over the owl's wings quieter and less clear. The shortcoming of an owl's fixed eyes can be made up by its  _  .", "subject": ""}

What do you do when you feel that way? Hide yourself away and spend your time reading, watching TV or walking around? You might think that feeling lonely is just like feeling happy, sad or scared -- that it's just one of your various moods. That is true. However, if you let yourself be lonely for too long without dealing with it, you could be making a serious mistake. Doctors have known for some time that feeling lonely is bad for the mind. It can lead to mental health problems such as depression, stress and reduce confidence. \"Being lonely means not feeling connected or cared for, but it's not about being mentally alone,\" Lisa Jaremka, scientist from Ohio State University, US, told Live Science in January. And there's growing evidence that not having friends is connected with physical illness as well. In 2006, for example, scientists studied 2,800 women who had cancer. They found that those who had few friends or family were five times more likely to die of their disease than women with many social contacts. Also, even healthy people had a better chance of falling ill if they felt left out by others, according to the BBC. The results have scientists thinking that loneliness might hurt the immune system , which protects the body from diseases. Hoping to prove this theory, Jaremka and her research team put volunteers  through a stress test. During the test, volunteers were asked to make an unprepared speech in front of a group of stony-faced people. The researchers found that volunteers who said they were lonely in their daily lives felt more stress during the test. And their blood samples showed that all the stress had managed to cause harmful changes to their immune system. \"Loneliness has been thought of in many ways as a chronic stressor  -- a socially painful situation that can last for quite a long time, \" explained Jaremka, who led the study.

They are known to carry dangerous diseases like SARS without getting sick. So researchers wanted to know: How do bats fight off so many deadly diseases? Learning their secret could help doctors better treat humans who have these diseases, therefore saving millions of lives. To solve this problem, a team of researchers from Australia and China analyzed bat DNA. The scientists studied two kinds of bats--the Australian megabat, known as the flying fox, and the Chinese microbat. The scientists then arranged the bat genome   in order by comparing their DNA. The researchers now think that the special immunity   to illness that bats have may be connected to their ability to fly. Bats are the only mammals   that can truly fly. Flying uses up a lot of energy. The energy burned for flying produces something in the animal called free radicals  . Free radicals can damage DNA and lead to diseases such as cancer. However, bats are not affected by free radicals produced during flight. The reason is that bats carry special genes to repair any damaged DNA. Scientists think that because bats fly and produce free radicals, they've evolved to carry genes that shaped their special immune system. \"We're thinking that the evolution of flight led to a sort of effect, influencing not only the immune system but also things like aging and cancer,\" says Chris Cowled, of the Australian Animal Health Laboratory. \"We think we've really found something special.\" Researchers believe that this discovery might one day be key to helping humans fight diseases such as cancer that attack the immune system and damage DNA.

Scientists think that because bats fly and produce free radicals, they've evolved to carry genes that shaped their special immune system. \"We're thinking that the evolution of flight led to a sort of effect, influencing not only the immune system but also things like aging and cancer,\" says Chris Cowled, of the Australian Animal Health Laboratory. \"We think we've really found something special.\" Researchers believe that this discovery might one day be key to helping humans fight diseases such as cancer that attack the immune system and damage DNA.

They are known to carry dangerous diseases like SARS without getting sick. So researchers wanted to know: How do bats fight off so many deadly diseases? Learning their secret could help doctors better treat humans who have these diseases, therefore saving millions of lives. To solve this problem, a team of researchers from Australia and China analyzed bat DNA. The scientists studied two kinds of bats--the Australian megabat, known as the flying fox, and the Chinese microbat. The scientists then arranged the bat genome   in order by comparing their DNA. The researchers now think that the special immunity   to illness that bats have may be connected to their ability to fly. Bats are the only mammals   that can truly fly.

The immigrants  can learn the language, English, to keep this country united, but it is unnecessary to change their culture for an American way of life. I believe that recent immigrants should learn English in order to live in the country. They should learn the \"public language\". If they don't learn English, they won't be able to communicate and do what they want. For example, my mother's friend came to the United States from Ecuador three years ago. She doesn't speak English. One day, her daughter, Anita, couldn't breathe. Anita didn't know what was going on, but she told her mother to call an ambulance. When her mother called the hospital, she couldn't communicate. The operator couldn't understand what Anita's mother was saying. Fortunately, her mother's sister arrived and called the ambulance. The doctor told her sister that if she hadn't arrived at the hospital on time, Anita could have died. A pill had gotten stuck in her throat. Immigrants should learn English to speak with the public, but they can also keep their language at home. The children of immigrants should learn how to speak their parents' language. It is very important to communicate with our relatives and family. If we learn English only and forget our private \"language\", we won't be able to communicate with our parents.

Zhang disappeared in January 1994 from Yanmenkou Township, and 3 months later a body was found in a pond that her relatives positively identified. Local police arrested Shen for murder in April 1994,although questions had been raised about discrepancies between the features and clothes of the body and Zhang. Confirmation through DNA testing had not been attempted. Zhang Chengmao, Shen's lawyer, said yesterday he would seek State compensation \"but we have not reached a figure yet\". When asked about compensation, Shen said, \"My mother, who died from the stress of continually appealing, cannot be bought. Eleven years of freedom cannot be bought. Schooling of my daughter that was stopped because of poverty cannot be bought.\" As for his wife, the man said he did not hate her at all. \"If she had not reappeared, maybe I would have been wronged for life,\" he said. He also said he did not plan to sue Zhang for bigamy, though she had remarried in Shandong Province without divorcing him. We can infer from the passage   _  .", "subject": ""}

Teachers teach and students learn, and many scientists are interested in finding ways to improve both the teaching and learning processes. Some researchers, such as Sian Beilock and Susan Levine, are trying to learn about learning. Beilock and Levine are psychologists at the University of Chicago. Psychologists study the ways people think and behave, and these researchers want to know how a person's thoughts and behavior are related. In a new study about the way kids learn math in elementary school, Beilock and Levine found a surprising relationship between what female teachers think and what female students learn: If a female teacher is uncomfortable with her own math skills, then her female students are more likely to believe that boys are better than girls at math. \"If these girls keep getting math-anxious female teachers in later grades,  _ ,\" Levine toldScience News. The study suggests that if these girls grow up believing that boys are better at math than girls are, then these girls may not do as well as they would have if they were more confident. Just as students find certain subjects to be difficult, teachers can find certain subjects to be difficult to learn--and teach. The subject of math can be particularly difficult for everyone. Researchers use the word \"anxiety\" to describe such feelings: anxiety is uneasiness or worry. (Many people, for example, have anxiety about going to the dentist because they're worried about pain.) The new study found that when a teacher has anxiety about math, that feeling can influence how her female students feel about math. The study involved 65 girls, 52 boys and 17 first- and second-grade teachers in elementary schools in the Midwest. The students took math achievement tests at the beginning and end of the school year, and the researchers compared the scores. The researchers also gave the students tests to tell whether the students believed that a math superstar had to be a boy. Then the researchers turned to the teachers: To find out which teachers were anxious about math, the researchers asked the teachers how they felt at times when they came across math, such as when reading a sales receipt. A teacher who got nervous looking at the numbers on a sales receipt, for example, was probably anxious about math. Boys, on average, were unaffected by a teacher's anxiety. On average, girls with math-anxious teachers scored lower on the end-of-the-year math tests than other girls in the study did. Plus, on the test showing whether someone thought a math superstar had to be a boy, 20 girls showed feeling that boys would be better at math--and all of these girls had been taught by female teachers who had math anxiety. According to surveys done before this one, college students who want to become elementary school teachers have the highest levels of anxiety about math. Plus, nine of every 10 elementary teachers are women, Levine said. This study was small, and it's often difficult to see large patterns in small studies, David Geary told Science News.

Researchers use the word \"anxiety\" to describe such feelings: anxiety is uneasiness or worry. (Many people, for example, have anxiety about going to the dentist because they're worried about pain.) The new study found that when a teacher has anxiety about math, that feeling can influence how her female students feel about math. The study involved 65 girls, 52 boys and 17 first- and second-grade teachers in elementary schools in the Midwest. The students took math achievement tests at the beginning and end of the school year, and the researchers compared the scores. The researchers also gave the students tests to tell whether the students believed that a math superstar had to be a boy. Then the researchers turned to the teachers: To find out which teachers were anxious about math, the researchers asked the teachers how they felt at times when they came across math, such as when reading a sales receipt. A teacher who got nervous looking at the numbers on a sales receipt, for example, was probably anxious about math. Boys, on average, were unaffected by a teacher's anxiety. On average, girls with math-anxious teachers scored lower on the end-of-the-year math tests than other girls in the study did. Plus, on the test showing whether someone thought a math superstar had to be a boy, 20 girls showed feeling that boys would be better at math--and all of these girls had been taught by female teachers who had math anxiety. According to surveys done before this one, college students who want to become elementary school teachers have the highest levels of anxiety about math. Plus, nine of every 10 elementary teachers are women, Levine said. This study was small, and it's often difficult to see large patterns in small studies, David Geary told Science News. Geary, a psychologist at the University of Missouri in Columbia, studies how children learn math. \"This is an interesting study, but the results need to be interpreted as preliminary and in need of replication with a larger sample,\" Geary said. That means that the results are just showing something that might be happening, but more studies should be done. If more studies find the same trend as this one, then it's possible that a teacher's anxiety over math really is affecting her female students. What is the finding of the new study?", "subject": ""}

Teachers teach and students learn, and many scientists are interested in finding ways to improve both the teaching and learning processes. Some researchers, such as Sian Beilock and Susan Levine, are trying to learn about learning. Beilock and Levine are psychologists at the University of Chicago. Psychologists study the ways people think and behave, and these researchers want to know how a person's thoughts and behavior are related. In a new study about the way kids learn math in elementary school, Beilock and Levine found a surprising relationship between what female teachers think and what female students learn: If a female teacher is uncomfortable with her own math skills, then her female students are more likely to believe that boys are better than girls at math. \"If these girls keep getting math-anxious female teachers in later grades,  _ ,\" Levine toldScience News.

Evaporation  from oceans creates most of the world's rainfall. Plants on land need the rain to absorb nutrients from the soil. The oceans are also home to all kinds of sea life. These include fish, whales, dolphins, octopi, lobsters, crabs and shrimps. There are also jellyfish and starfish.Many kinds of plants, such as plankton, kelp and sea grass are part of the \"forest of the seafloor.\" Carbon dioxide in-oxygen out! Oceans help to capture and store carbon dioxide(C02). They are the largest natural \"carbon sinks\" in the world. Oceans trap about1/4of the CO2 that humans put into the air. Oceans also release oxygen. Half of the world's oxygen is produced by these tiny plants! It can be inferred from the passage that  _", "subject": ""}

Training wasn't easy, but I kept going. I didn't need special training but I did need to buy very good shoes. Each day, I went a little further.

She gave him a big hug. \"I'm going to go play cards with Lizzy!\" she said. \"See you later!\" From the kitchen window, Mama and Papa watched their daughter run down the sunny road toward Lizzy's house. \"It's good to see her happy again,\" said Mama. \"It sure is,\" Papa agreed. \"As for the swimming team, there's always next year.\" \"If?\" Mama prompted him. \"Oh, right,\" said Papa. \"If she wants to.\" Mama smiled. \"At least you're learning, dear,\" she said.

For years studies have shown people in lower-status jobs generally have higher rates of heart disease and other illnesses and die earlier than those in higher-status positions while job authority  has shown no relationship with workers' health. But University of Toronto researchers, using data from 1,800 US workers, found the health of people in higher positions is affected by work as they are more likely to report conflicts with co-workers and say work disturbs their home life. However, the positive aspects of having a power position at work, such as higher status, more pay and greater independence, seemed to cancel out   the negative aspects when it came to people's physical and psychological health. These latest findings, reported in the journal Social Science & Medicine, suggest that the advantages and disadvantages of authority positions basically cancel each other out, giving the general impression that job authority has no health effects. For the study, the researchers surveyed participants about various aspects of their work, life and well-being. Job authority was judged based on whether a person managed other employees and had power over hiring, firing and pay. Physical health complaints included problems like headaches, body aches, heartburn and tiredness. Psychological complaints included sleep problems, difficulty concentrating and feelings of sadness, worry and anxiety. \"This isn't to suggest that having authority is 'bad' -- in fact, we show it has benefits ... but it is important to identify the negative sides and deal with them.\" researcher Scott Schieman said.

But it is said that it began in the early 1900s. Jazz was a new kind of music, for America and the world, and New Orleans was its birthplace. Who were the jazz pioneers? Most were blacks. This music was not written down, and at first only blacks played it. It was hard for white musicians to learn the new style. But soon they, too, were playing jazz. The popularity of this music spread. From New Orleans, it traveled up the Mississippi to Chicago, then to Kansas City and New York. By the 1920s, there were many jazz musicians, both black and white. Many of them were famous. One man was better than the rest. His name was Louis Armstrong. Louis Armstrong was a born musician. He was not only talented but also hard-working. He also had a good sense of humor and a big, good-natured smile. These personal qualities were valuable in his rise to fame. After he became famous, he traveled around the world. It seemed that everyone wanted to hear Louis play. But life was not always easy, especially at the beginning. Louis Armstrong was born in 1900 in New Orleans. His father never went to school and his mother could hardly read. When Louis was still a kid, his parents separated, and Louis lived with his mother. How hard their life was can readily be imagined.

That is why the doctor uses his thermometer  when your are sick. The body keeps the same temperature all the time ,because it balances the heat it produces and it gives off. It is always burning up food and , producing heat. It can produce heat faster when it needs to give off heat than when it becomes too warm. Let's see how this happen. The heat of your body is given off mainly through the skin. When you are cold, your skin is tight and shows \"good flesh\". When you get chilly, you must dance around to keep warm or else you will shiver. Then your muscles begin to work, burn up fuel, and produce more heat. It is not pleasant to shiver, so you usually prefer to warm up by exercise, or put on more clothes to keep heat in. When you are warm, the skin is loose and soft. It is so supplied with blood that heat is given off rapidly. If you get too warm, you begin to sweat ,and more body heat is used in evaporating the moisture  from your skin. You wear less clothing, too, in warm weather or warm room, so that warm can be given off freely. You feel less like exercising because your body is warm already, and the extra heat produced by exercise makes you uncomfortable.

{"answer": 3, "choices": ["the hunters wanted to see the pictures", "the painters were animal lovers", "the painters wanted to show imagination", "the pictures were thought to be helpful"], "question": "People have been painting pictures for at least 30,000 years. The earliest pictures were painted by people who hunted animals. They used to paint pictures of the animals they wanted to catch and kill. Pictures of this kind have been found on the walls of caves in France and Spain. No one knows why they were painted there. Perhaps the painters thought that their pictures would help them to catch these animals. Or perhaps human beings have always wanted to tell stories according to pictures. About 5,000 years ago, the Egyptians and other people in the Near East began to use pictures as kind of writing. They drew simple pictures or signs to represent things and ideas, and also to represent the sounds of their language. The signs these people used became a kind of alphabet. The Egyptians used to record information and to tell stories by putting picture writing and pictures together. When an important person died, scenes and stories from his life were painted and carved on the walls of the place where he was buried. Some of these pictures are like modern comic strip stories. It has been said that Egypt is the home of the comic strip. But, for the Egyptians, pictures still had magic power. So they did not try to make their way of writing simple. The ordinary people could not understand it. By the year 1,000 BC, people who lived in the area around the Mediterranean Sea had developed a simpler system of writing. The signs they used were very easy to write, and there were fewer of them than in the Egyptian system. This was because each sign, or letter, represented only one sound in their language. The Greeks developed this system and formed the letters of the Greek alphabet. The Romans copied the idea, and the Roman alphabet is now used all over the world.

I had the most wonderful childhood, and it's not because I had everything I wanted or because I was a cool kid. I have learned a lot about parenting from what my parents did. Here are a few gems   that I use now or plan to use in the future with my two boys. Here's how a conversation often went when I was a kid. Usually it was around 4:30 p.m. I said, \"I'm hungry. Can I have a cookie?\" My mom answered, \"No. Have a banana.\" \"I don't want a banana.\" \"Then you're not hungry.\" Sometimes I was angry about it, but I knew that was good for me. Thanks mom for not letting me eat junk food  . Now I agree with my mother and I have this same conversation with my three-year-old son. I hope it helps him form healthy diet habits. I know many of us heard this as children. \"If everyone jumped off a bridge, would you do it, too?\" If our kids asked for something just because everyone else had it or was doing it, we often got this response. It was the perfect response, and we soon learned not to ask for things because everyone else had it, but because it was something we wanted. I will always be thankful that my parents let us try the things that interested us, not the things they wanted to push us into. This helped me try swimming, dance, and the piano before second grade. I found a love -- singing -- and kept up with that through my college years. It drives me crazy, as a mom and teacher, when I see kids who are pushed into their parents' favorite activities, even when they don't have a passion for them.

Jean Viry-Babel is the CEO of IanXen, the company that developed the app. He says it is cheap and works on the spot. \"So we take a high-definition picture of a sample of blood. We separate the red blood cells from the rest---the white blood cells, the platelets ---and we start looking at each of the red blood cells individually,\" said Viry-Babel. Viry-Babel says the app is affordable, easy to use and provides reliability of up to 98 percent. The only additional equipment required is an ordinary glass lab slide - called a \"slate.\" \"There's only one button, which is called \"Diagnose\". So you put it on the slate and you put it on the dried blood, and you press diagnose and it tells you yes or no,\" he said. Researchers say the field-testing of the device will begin in January and February in Tanzania, Benin and Indonesia --- while commercial use is scheduled to start by the end of March. They also plan to expand the versatility of the new device---teaching it to recognize other diseases, such as tuberculosis and Lyme Disease. What can we learn from Viry-Babel?", "subject": ""}

The researchers hoped to find clues to explain the force of the melting ice and its effect on sea level rise. Reed Scherer and Ross Powell are with Northern Illinois University in DeKalb, Illinois. They just finished up their research on our southernmost continent. Money for the project came from America's National Science Foundation. \"We chose a study site where, in the first year ,We went into the subglacial  lake and tried to understand the environment in there, both ecologically and in terms of the ice dynamics about how the lake operates ,and how the sediment  underneath the ice sheet operates, as well, because it's the water and the sediment underneath the ice that controls how fast the ice is flowing into the ocean\" says Ross Powell, who led the investigation. The team included scientists ,engineers, machinery and other supplies across the ice from the main U.S. scientific base at Mc Murdo Station to the researcher's camp .The camp  was near a subglacial lake ,where an earlier study took place, Ross Powell says the latest study may provide evidence that can help predict the effect of climate change on rising sea levels. \"What we have found is that these are very sensitive areas to the stability of how dynamic the ice is and how fast the ice may react to increases of melting both from the ocean and the atmosphere.\" Among the new instruments built for the project was a powerful hot water drill. The researchers used the drill to dig down some 740 meters. They collected water ,sediment and other material from the grounding zone. Working around the clock before the deep hole refroze, they sent a video camera down to the 400-square-meter undersea area. Reed Scherer says the video images they saw in the Command Center were a total surprise. \"It's a very mobile environment. The bottom is changing constantly. And so the things that we saw were all very mobile organisms, things that swim and some things that crawl. And obviously they are getting enough nutrition that they can thrive, Some of the little crustacean-like creatures called amphipods that we saw swam quite quickly and were quite active.\" This is the farthest south that fish have ever been seen. How did the creatures get here? What do they feed on? And what effect will the retreating ice have on them? Ross Powell says the ice and sediment cores taken from the grounding zone can offer clues. \"We know that the ice is melting there at the moment and so by opening up the cores once they get back, we hope to be able to understand what the ice was doing in the past ,relative to what it is doing now. And because it is melting so fast or seems to be melting fast at the moment, we anticipate that there will he some differences that we'll see in the history of the ice sheet from the sediment cores, once we open them up .\"But Ross Powell says the work raises more questions than it answers.

These cards are more secure than the traditional magnetic-strip version and can be used to travel on buses, check bank accounts and do shopping. The Manchester project is one of the biggest smart card schemes in the world. Every time people use the cards on a bus or train, the fare is deducted (reduced) from the value of the card. When they have no credit left, the cards can be recharged at a local shop. A smart card looks just like a normal plastic card but it has a silicon chip in it. It is possible for the same silicon chip to perform a number of different functions, so one plastic card in your pocket could do a large number of different jobs. The card has much more memory space than a magnetic-strip card, so many more things can be recorded on it.There are two types of smart cards. One is the contact card which is used in the same way as a magnetic-strip card. Information is transferred by running the card through a narrow opening in an electronic reader. In the slot, electronic probes make contact with the magnetic-strip or silicon ship and read the information. The other type is the contactless smart card where the electronic reader communicates with the card by short-range radio waves. This makes the card quicker and more convenient to use because it does not have to leave your wallet.  It is also more reliable as it is not easily influenced by scratches or dirt. However, the biggest advantage that smart cards have over magnetic-strip cards is that they are more secure. They are much more difficult to make than conventional cards and they have to be made by specially trained manufacturers. In addition, they have a large number of extra security features on them and if a smart card gets lost or stolen a quick phone-call to the distributor ensures that its individual number is made invalid and unreadable.

For 20 years, its leaders have foolishly spent down the patrimony of a century's prosperity. One of America's bedrock brands is about to disappear, the Kodak moment has passed. But George Eastman is not how he died, and the Eastman Kodak Company is not how it is being killed. Though the ends be needless and premature, they must not be allowed to overshadow the greatness that came before. Few companies have done so much good for so many people, or defined and lifted so profoundly the spirit of a nation and perhaps the world. It is impossible to understand the 20th Century without recognizing the role of the Eastman Kodak Company. Kodak served mankind through entertainment, science, national defense and the stockpiling of family memories. Kodak took us to the top of Mount Suribachi and to the Sea of Tranquility. It introduced us to the merry old Land of Oz and to stars from Charlie Chaplin to John Wayne, and Elizabeth Taylor to Tom Hanks. It showed us the shot that killed President Kennedy, and his brother bleeding out on a kitchen floor, and a fallen Martin Luther King Jr. on the hard balcony of a Memphis motel. When that sailor kissed the nurse, and when the spy planes saw missiles in Cuba, Kodak was the eyes of a nation. From the deck of the Missouri to the grandeur of Monument Valley, Kodak took us there. Virtually every significant image of the 20th Century is a gift to posterity from the Eastman Kodak Company. In an era of easy digital photography, when we can take a picture of anything at any time, we cannot imagine what life was like before George Eastman brought photography to people. Yes, there were photographers, and for relatively large sums of money they would take stilted pictures in studios and formal settings. But most people couldn't afford photographs, and so all they had to remember distant loved ones, or earlier times of their lives, was memory. Children could not know what their parents had looked like as young people, grandparents far away might never learn what their grandchildren looked like. Eastman Kodak allowed memory to move from the uncertainty of recollection, to the permanence of a photograph. But it wasn't just people whose features were savable; it was events, the sacred and precious times that families cherish. The Kodak moment, was humanity's moment. And it wasn't just people whose features were savable; it was events, the precious times that familes cherish.  Kodak let the fleeting moments of birthdays and weddings, picnics and parties, be preserved and saved. It allowed for the creation of the most egalitarian art form. Lovers could take one another's pictures, children were photographed walking out the door on the first day of school, decided what was worth recording, and hundreds of millions of such decisions were made. And for centuries to come, those long dead will smile and dance and communicate to their unborn progeny. Family history will be not only names on paper, but smiles on faces.

I have been away from it for over twenty years, but I still go back in my dreams.\" For Yep, whose father came from China, home was an apartment and the family grocery store in a neighborhood of San Francisco. It was there that he learned about patience, hard work, and getting along with neighbors. Mr. Brown, Laurence Yep's high school English teacher, often set high goals for his students. He was the first person to encourage Yep to write. The experience of that class changed the direction of Yep's life. At the age of 18 Yep published his first short story, a sci-fi fantasy. He has since written many books and many kinds of books. He has retold Chinese folk stories and written for the theater. In nearly all these varied works, Yep, who is married to the children's book author Joanne Ryder, has returned to questions he has been asking himself since childhood: What does it mean to be Chinese and American? Can one who belongs to two cultures ever feel at home anywhere? When asked, \"How has being of a Chinese by origin been important to you?\" Laurence Yep replied, \"As a child I wanted to be as American as possible. Then, in my early twenties, I became very interested in my Chinese roots. For years after that, I thought that my function as a Chinese American writer was to act as a bridge between two cultures. Now, though, I am not so sure that it is possible to join them together. Compared with Asian culture, American culture pays more attention to individuals and competition. The two cultures pull in opposite directions. So I see myself now as someone who will always be on the border between two cultures. That works to my benefit as a writer because not quite fitting in helps me be a better observer.\" Which of the following best describes Laurence Yep's attitude to life?", "subject": ""}

Some have drawn a parallel between the personal responsibility in North American settings and the view itself. The North American view is vast, with large spaces of unpopulated land. The frontier attitude of \"King\" of the wilderness, and the expansiveness of the land reaching huge distances, may relate to generally high levels of confidence in the ability to shape and choose our destinies. In this expansive land, many children grow up with a heroic sense of life, where ideas are big, and hope springs forever.

This may sound difficult, but technology is making the process easier. Perhaps you've wanted to change a bad habit but couldn't. Self-tracking may be your answer. The idea is to take information about your everyday activities and analyze them to help form a healthier lifestyle. Recently, tools such as smartphones, journals and apps, along with newly published wearable things, are making self-tracking extremely easy. Today, one can use Fitbit, the Jawbone Up, Google Glass or a smart watch to record personal data including sleeping hours, stress levels, heart rate and mood. So why does a person self-track? Someone may be trying to lose weight or improve their sleep patterns. Another person feels tired after eating. Self-tracking could help him to know what foods make him sleepy and watch his diet. Monitoring daily activities isn't a new concept. In years past, athletes and their coaches kept notes detailing nutrition, training and sleep patterns in order to achieve an athletic goal. Similarly, doctors have also helped patients to record parts of their lifestyles and eating habits to help fight allergies, headaches and other health problems.

Garrett Peterson, now 18 months old, was born with tracheomalacia  , leaving him unable to breathe. The condition terrified his parents, who turned to specialist Dr. Glenn Green at the University of Michigan for a possible treatment. Along with Scott Hollister, a biomedical engineer who runs the university's 3-D printing lab, Green designed a device that can hold open Garrett's windpipe until it's strong enough to function independently. After taking a CT scan of Garrett's windpipe to make a replica of it, they made the \"splint\" with a 3-D printer. \"It's like a protective shell that goes on the outside of the windpipe, and it allows the windpipe to be tacked to the inside of that shell to open it up directly,\" Green told NPR. On January 31, Garrett had his surgery. Surgeon Dr. Richard Ohye opened up Garrett's chest and saw that his windpipe had completely collapsed and one of his lungs was completely white -- a condition Ohye had only seen in dead bodies. After eight hours of surgery and careful placement of a splint on either side of Garrett's windpipe, it was time for the big test: What would happen when they let air flow through the windpipe into Garrett's lungs?

One of the reasons why there is so much traffic is that few people use public transportation to get around Experts say one possible solution to the traffic problem in Los Angeles would be to make people want to use the public transportation system of buses instead of their own cars. People say the buses should be made easier, faster, less costly and more dependable than driving a car. One suggestion is to reduce the cost of riding the bus. People who usually drive their cars could save a lot of money on gas and parking costs. Also, Los Angeles could make the buses easier for people to use. The buses could travel to more places in the city. And there could be more special lanes on the freeways that only buses could drive in. These changes would make taking the bus faster and easier than driving a car. Other experts have said that the best way to ease traffic problems is to charge people money to drive on the freeways. These charges, or tolls, would be for the most crowded roads. The tolls would be in effect during the times of day when most people drive to work and home again.

Teens who have recently gotten their driver's licenses may be taking the wheel to school this fall. However, parents fear when their teen starts driving. And it turns out that such parental fears are justified, so it's worth reviewing how to keep your teen safe while he or she is behind the wheel. Motor vehicle crashes are the leading cause of death among US teens. Drivers 16 to 19 years old are at the greatest risk of crashes. In fact, their risk is 4 times greater than that of older drivers. The teens at the greatest risk are those who are male, those carrying other teenage passengers in the car, and those still in their first year of driving. Nearly 50 percent of teen deaths related to automobile crashes happen on Fridays, Saturdays, or Sundays between the hours of 3 pm and midnight. Why are teens at higher risk of motor vehicle crashes?

Teens also have a greater tendency to speed and to drive too close to the cars in front of them. No seatbelts. Teens have the lowest rate of seatbelt use among all driving groups. Alcohol. A least 25 percent of motor vehicle deaths in teens are related to drinking alcohol.

But the gem cutter assumed that a stone so large could only be glass and refused. It turned out that the gem was genuine and could have been worth close to $3,000,000!  The gem cutter missed his chance to hit the jeweler's jackpot and make history. Would you have made the same mistake then? Will you make it today?   In the decades since its discovery, tanzanite has become one of the world's most precious gemstones.

And as 87 percent of Europe's drivers do less than 37 miles a day -- 50 per cent less than 12--there's really no need to be burning gas for that sort of journey. The Twizy is arguably the most unusual vehicle in this country. Other cars have been beautifully designed, others have been small, but no car has turned motoring on its head in quite the same way. The Twizy's batteries have a range of 62 miles, and it plugs into a standard socket like any other electrical equipment, going from flat to full power in three and a half hours. There are no full doors on the vehicle, so think of it like a covered moped with four wheels, but no noise and no need for a helmet. There's also a lower-powered type being designed, the Twizy 45, for which you don' t need a license. Seeing the Twizy in the flesh, you' re surprised by how striking it looks. Sit in it and everything feels right --just car enough to be easy, but different enough to be exciting. With the battery underneath you, the vehicle is suckered   to the road, and the electric power means it accelerates with real energy up to about 50 mph. You don't feel you need any more. In the UK, the weather alone may make it a good buy, but the lack of easy access to outdoor sockets is the biggest challenge.

Now, scientists discover they can monitor these \"uncontacted tribes\" using satellites, which would allow inexpensive and safe tracking of these tribes in order to protect them from outside threats. In order to help preserve these uncontacted Indians, researchers need accurate estimates of their populations. One way to collect this data involves flying over their villages, but such over-flights are both expensive and could fill these native peoples with fear. Another strategy involves meeting individuals on the ground, but among other risks, scientists could accidentally spread disease to members of the tribes. Instead, scientists investigated whether satellite images could monitor uncontacted tribes. The result was inspiring. They confirmed their locations and measured the sizes of their village, houses and gardens. \"We can find isolated villages with remote sensing and study them over time.\" Walker told Live Science. \"We can ask: Are they growing? Do they move?\" Surprisingly, based on the sizes of the houses and villages, the scientists find the population densities of these isolated villages are about 10 times greater, on average, than other villages of native Brazilian peoples. This may be due to the fact that they have to live closer together because they are not as good at clearing the forest, since they lack modern devices like chainsaws and tractors, the researchers said. The tribes may also be afraid of spreading out due to fear of being attacked by outsiders, Walker said. The researchers now plan to focus on 29 more isolated villages to \"look at their ecology-- that is, distance from rivers and roads--and use this to model where else we can find more isolated villages,\" Walker said.

Do they move?\" Surprisingly, based on the sizes of the houses and villages, the scientists find the population densities of these isolated villages are about 10 times greater, on average, than other villages of native Brazilian peoples. This may be due to the fact that they have to live closer together because they are not as good at clearing the forest, since they lack modern devices like chainsaws and tractors, the researchers said. The tribes may also be afraid of spreading out due to fear of being attacked by outsiders, Walker said. The researchers now plan to focus on 29 more isolated villages to \"look at their ecology-- that is, distance from rivers and roads--and use this to model where else we can find more isolated villages,\" Walker said.

Now, scientists discover they can monitor these \"uncontacted tribes\" using satellites, which would allow inexpensive and safe tracking of these tribes in order to protect them from outside threats. In order to help preserve these uncontacted Indians, researchers need accurate estimates of their populations. One way to collect this data involves flying over their villages, but such over-flights are both expensive and could fill these native peoples with fear. Another strategy involves meeting individuals on the ground, but among other risks, scientists could accidentally spread disease to members of the tribes.

In those days, people did not really eat chocolate; the cocoa bean was used to make a chocolate drink that the people enjoyed very much. Much later the cocoa bean was brought to Europe and people there also came to love the taste of it. In 1824, John Cadbury opened a small shop in Birmingham. One of the items he sold was cocoa powder to be made into drinks. In 1831, he opened a small factory to make cocoa powder from cocoa beans. John Cadbury believed that alcohol was an important cause of people's being poor, and he wanted to encourage people to drink chocolate instead. A few years later a man called Joseph Fry invented a way to make chocolate bars, and so for the first time people had the chance to eat chocolate instead of only drinking it. At first, chocolate was luxury and only the rich people could buy it. Later, as more and more chocolate bars were produced and sold, they became cheaper. However, at first, only plain chocolate was produced. Milk chocolate came later and this was made by adding milk or milk powder to the chocolate. Cadbury introduced their first milk chocolate bars in 1897. Their most famous chocolate, Cadbury's Milk Bar, was introduced in 1905.

{"answer": 3, "choices": ["We Value Life", "We Love Nature", "We Better Ourselves", "We Lack Nothing"], "question": "An ancient philosopher felt: be content with what you have; be pleased about the way things are. When you realize that, the whole world belongs to you. When we can be grateful for what we have, and take our focus off what we think we are short of, it's amazing how our feelings will shift to a place of peace and happiness. The reason for \"an attitude of thankfulness\" isn't necessarily so that God can hear our appreciation, but perhaps so that we can live happily and peacefully, with a feeling of \"all is well\". Have you ever experienced this-the feeling that \"what is\" is great, and there is no need to wish for things to be different? It's a wonderful feeling and a great way to go through life. Here's an example: We have strong winds in the desert at times, and the other day the high winds broke three arms on the beautiful mimosa tree in my back yard.  The tree's arms are twisted and the leaves and flowers are dying. It looks hurt and brown. Well, that's certainly one way to choose to look at it, And if I choose that way, then I can allow myself to get upset that the tree has been hurt, that there will be less shade in the yard, that I have to cut up and pull away the branches, etc. OR I can choose to see that \"all is well\" -that nature does what it does, that trees will lose branches, that the yard is not a _ thing, but it is alive. In other words, I can choose to be okay with \"what is\". Either way, the tree situation hasn't changed-I've simply changed how I choose to interpret it. My interpretation then affects my emotions, my state of peacefulness, my happiness with things, etc. When I choose to be content with \"what is\", to be pleased about the way things are, and to see that nothing is missing, that everything is just fine, then I choose to be at peace.

He turned to the flight attendant and hurriedly stated, \"We got problems!\" I thought to myself, \"Why did I have to be the one to hear that? Why couldn't I have been at the back of the line? I didn't need to know that!\" Very soon we were back in the terminal, waiting, and then finally back on the plane. I waited for the pilot to give an explanation. Pilots take courses to ease passengers' mind, right? They know what to say to calm nerves. Unfortunately, I didn't think this pilot took that course. Soon his voice thundered throughout the plane, \"Sorry for the delay, ladies and gentlemen. We had no power on the plane. We have a generator on the ground right now, and we're going to jump-start the engines. Once we get them going, we'll get up in the air and head to Norfolk, and see what happens.\"  See what happens? We were going to get up in the air, and see what happens? Couldn't we have another plan, one that's been worked out just a little better? At this point, all I could do was to laugh nervously. One woman started yelling, \"Oh no! We're going to crash!\" There were sighs of desperation and anxiety spreading throughout the cabin. Finally, we got up in the air thirty minutes later, and what happened? Nothing ---other than thrust   and lift. We arrived in Norfolk, and no sooner had the wheels touched the ground than a round of applause burst out, as everyone throughout the airplane simultaneously   breathed a sigh of relief. Although, I did sincerely like to have a plan better than \"see what happens\" worked out when flying --- it really isn't such a bad life strategy. Success will never be guaranteed. The best thing you can do is just get up in the air, and see what happens. Sometimes adjustments would be made in the air, or shall we say, in the middle of the process.

Studies show that interpersonal distance can be divided into 4 different types:intimate distance,personal distance,social distance,and public distance. Intimate distance is the interpersonal distance of a person with the people closest to him or her.It ranges from 0 to 45 cm.When a stranger comes within this distance,a person will have strong negative reaction.In crowded buses,strangers usually maintain rigid poses and try to avoid body contact,but couples,lovers,children and their mothers usually lean close to each other.Intimates who aren't able to live close together for a long time can become alienated.Also,touching is also very important.A contrast test shows that the nervous systems of babies who are often caressed by their mothers develop much faster and their weight increases faster,by 47%,than that of other babies. Personal distance ranges from 45 cm to 1 m.People can converse genially at this distance without invading each other's personal space.When friends and acquaintances meet on the street,they usually greet and converse at this distance. Social distance generally ranges from 1 m to 3 m.Among this range,1-2 m is usually the distance in which people deal with private affairs in social activities.For example,when you get money from banks,in order to protect your privacy,other customers are required to stand at least 1 m away from you.2-3.5 m is a farther social distance.Business talks usually occur at this distance.Besides talking,proper eye contact is also indispensable.Otherwise,each side will feel disrespected. Public distance is usually used in public gatherings.It generally ranges from 3.5 m to about 7 m.Beyond this range,people can't communicate using a normal voice.In classrooms,experienced teachers usually leave their lecture platforms to enhance their teaching.

Research shows any interruption in medical work can lead to errors --- a nurse may forget whether she has given medicine and may give a patient double the dose   or none at all. The robots vary in size according to what job they perform, but normally take the shape of a metal box on wheels, with a box on the side containing their software. After being programmed, the robots are able to find their way around a hospital unassisted. They also contain scanning technology to create electronic pictures or a \"memory\" of routes on their hard drives to help them go through passages, doors and other obstacles. Each robot is also monitored at the producer's headquarters   in case it runs into any difficulties. Trials show TUGs reduce the time it takes for a patient to receive medicine, and stop drugs from going missing. A study at the University of Maryland Medical Centre in the U.S. found that when three TUGs were used over the course of a year, the average length of time from the drugstore receiving a prescription to the patient receiving it dropped from 74 minutes to 30 minutes and saved nurses 6,123 hours finding medicines. It also cut the number of medicines that went missing to zero. \"The biggest complaints we receive from patients is that the nurses don't spend enough time with them. Anything that frees nurses is a  _ ,\" says Katherine Mulligan, director of nursing at the hospital, \"The TUGs allow nurses to spend more time focusing on patient care. Nurse satisfaction has improved.\" What is the attitude of the author towards robot-nurses?", "subject": ""}

Nanotechnology covers those man-made materials or objects that are about a thousand times smaller than the microtechnology we use, such as the silicon chips of computers. Nanotechnology gets its name from the nanometer, which is a billionth of a meter. There are about 600 consumer products already on the market that use nanotechnology. Nanomedicine is also being developed to fight cancer and other fatal diseases. The Royal Commission found no evidence of harm to health or the environment from nanomaterials, but this \"absence of evidence\" is not being taken as \"evidence of absence\". In other words, just because there are no apparent problems, this is not to say that here is no risk now or in the future. The commission is concerned about the pace at which we are inventing and adopting new nanomaterials, which could result in future problems that we are ill-equipped to understand or even find with current testing methods. One of the problems about nanotechnology is that when we make something very small out of a well known material, we may actually change the functionality of that material even if the chemical composition remains the same. Indeed, it is not the particle size that should concern us, but its functionality. Take gold, for example, which is a famously inert   substance, and valuable because of it. It doesn't rust or corrode because it doesn't interact with water or oxygen. However, a particle of gold that is between 2 and 5 nanometers in diameter becomes highly reactive. This is not due to a change in chemical composition, but because of a change in the physical size of the gold particles. How can a change in size result in a change of function? One reason is to do with surface area. Nanoparticles have relatively a much bigger surface area. It is like comparing the surface area of a basketball with the total surface area of many pea-sized balls with the same weight of the single basketball. The pea-sized balls have a surface area many hundreds, indeed thousands of times bigger than the basketball, and this allows them to interact more easily with the environment. It is this increased interactivity that changes their functionality--and makes them potentially more dangerous to health or the environment.

{"answer": 3, "choices": ["Pitiful and selfless.", "Shy and passive.", "Great and generous.", "Determined and inspiring."], "question": "Susan was born as the ninth child in a Catholic family. She suffered from learning disabilities ever since her birth because of her mother's poor health. School was difficult for Susan and she was bullied because of her different behaviors. Her siblings, who were much older, had life experiences that were unknown to their little sister. From the time of her birth, Susan was a screamer. The only really safe place that she would use as a repeat was her bedroom. There she would hang posters of her musical idols on the wall and sing popular music into a hairbrush that she pretended was a microphone. One by one the siblings moved away from home and then Susan's father died. This left her alone with an aging mother and a cat. The siblings accused her mother of not expecting more out of Susan. She had seen many professionals and remembered hearing the word \"borderline\" but didn't know what it meant. She tried volunteer work. Her best state of mind, however, was found when she was singing and so she would regularly join others in karaoke or pubs where she could show her skills and receive appreciation from the crowd. When Susan announced at Christmas that she was planning to compete in the Britain's Got Talent contest, her siblings tried to discourage her. It was a wonder that she was even able to do the audition considering the troubles she faced just physically getting to the right place. \"The Woman I Was Born to Be\" is a beautiful story written in the simple but humorous voice of the author, Susan Boyle. She tells her story from birth to the present in an interesting and educational manner. The writing is supplemented by photos from her albums. I love this book! In fact, I read the whole thing in one day! There is something in the stories that not only teaches the reader but also inspires us to reach for our dreams -- no matter how impossible they may seem to be! What does the author think of Susan Boyle?", "subject": ""}
{"answer": 3, "choices": ["show the value of Brooks's new book", "show where science can be applied", "remind the reader of the importance of science", "explain why many writers use science in their works"], "question": "Science has a lot of uses. It can reveal   laws of nature, cure diseases, make bombs, and help bridges to stand up. Indeed science is so good at what it does that there's always a temptation   to drag it into problems where it may not be helpful. David Brooks, author ofThe Social Animal, The Hidden Sources of Love, Character, and Achievement, appears to be the latest in a long line of writers who have failed to resist the temptation. Brooks gained fame for several books. His latest bookThe Social Animal, however, is more ambitious and serious than his earlier books. It is an attempt to deal with a set of weighty topics. The book focuses on big questions: What has science revealed about human nature? What are the sources of character? And why are some people happy and successful while others aren't? To answer these questions, Brooks surveys a wide range of subjects. Because of this, you might expect the book to cover a variety of facts. But Brooks has structured his book in an unusual, and perhaps unfortunate way. Instead of introducing scientific theories, he tells a story, within which he tries to make his points, perhaps in order to keep the reader's attention. So as Harold and Erica, the hero and heroine in his story, live through childhood, we hear about the science of child development and as they begin to date we hear about the theory of sexual attraction. Brooks carries this through to the death of one of his characters. On the whole, Brooks's story is acceptable if uninspired. As one would expect, his writing is mostly clear and, to be fair, some chapters stand out above the rest. I enjoyed, for instance, the chapter in which Harold discovers how to think on his own. While Harold and Erica are certainly not strong characters, the more serious problems withThe Social Animallie elsewhere.

But I will not forget that he visited me on that day, and sat there for I don't know how long, while I was under the influence of a morphine drip . We benefit greatly from our close friendships, but they are not a matter of calculable gain or loss. Our age, what we might call the age of economics, is strongly influenced by two types of relationships that reflect the lives we are encouraged to lead. There are consumer relationships, those that we participate in for the pleasure they bring us. They are focused on the present. It is what brings immediate pleasure that matters. And there are entrepreneurial relationships, those that we invest in, hoping they will bring us some return. Aristotle thought that there were three types of friendship: those of pleasure, those of usefulness, and true friendship. In pleasure friendships, he said, \"It is not for their character that men love ready-witted people, but because they find them pleasant.\" About the usefulness friendships, he said, \"Those who love each other for their utility do not love each other for themselves, but because of some good which they get from each other.\" Although we benefit from our close friendships, these friendships are not a matter of calculable gain and loss. Consumer pleasures are lasting for only a limited time. They surround us for a short period and then they fade, like a drug. Entrepreneur friendship, when successful, leads to the victory of personal gain. It is precisely this non-economic character that is threatened in a society in which each of us is offered only the choices of ownership, shopping, competition and growth. It is threatened when we are led to believe that friendships without obvious recognizable gain are, in the economic sense, irrational . Friendships are not without reason, perhaps, but they are certainly without that particular reason. Shared experience, not just everyday amusement or advancement, is the true basis of friendship.

{"answer": 3, "choices": ["stored sugars-recycled protein-fat", "recycled protein-fat-stored sugars", "fat-recycled protein-stored sugars", "stored sugars-fat-recycled protein"], "question": "A 44-year-old Swedish man, Peter Skyllberg, was found in a car buried under snow, at the end of a forest track more than 1 km from a main road in northern Sweden. He survived for two months without food by eating handfuls of snow. But how long can people go without food? Skyllberg had been inside the car since 19 December, 2011. Experts believe it's possible for the human body to survive without food for up to two months. Last year, a 56-year-old woman from British Columbia survived nearly 50 days in the Nevada wilderness on sweets and water after being stranded in the mountains while her husband went in search of help. In fact there're many causes that can influence a person's ability to survive, such as the way the body's metabolism  slows down to keep energy. When the body stops getting food, it has to live on the stored sugars. When this runs out, fat is then turned into the second energy supply. After the fat runs out, the body must take recycled protein from the system and finally from the muscles. But this is very expensive fuel for the body. It's like being in a cold house and burning furniture instead of firewood. However, the muscle loss slows the body's work, causing it to burn calories at a slower rate. Being trapped into a small space would have helped Skyllberg keep precious calories. The car was covered in snow, creating what some experts have described as an \"igloo effect\" on the car. A person's mental state can play a key role in how long they survive, according to Stephen Joseph, a professor at the University of Nottingham. \"In dangerous situations survival depends on personalities. Some might lose hope, while others are more hopeful.\" says Joseph. \"Hope is probably a big key to this.\" Which of the following shows the right order of human body getting energy when there is no food?", "subject": ""}

People can be forgetful, and they can sometimes also \"remember\" things incorrectly, with damaging consequences in the classroom, courtroom, and other areas of life. Now, researchers show for the first time that bumblebees  can be unreliable witnesses too. Bumblebees are rather clever animals, which explains why Chittka has been studying learning and memory in the insects for the last 20 years. Most times when people have studied memory in animals, errors in performance have been taken to mean that the animals failed to learn the task or perhaps learned it and then forgot. But what if animals can experience a more interesting type of memory failure? To find out, Chittka first trained bumblebees to expect a reward when visiting a yellow artificial flower followed by one with black-and-white rings. During subsequent tests, bees were given a choice between three types of flowers. Two were the types they'd seen in the training before. The third had yellow-and-white rings, representing a mixed-up version of the other two. Minutes after the training, the bees showed a clear preference for the flower that recently rewarded them. One or three days later, however, something very different happened when the bumblebees' memory was put to the test. At first, the bees showed the same preference displayed in the earlier tests, but as the time went on, they began selecting the flower with yellow rings, even though they'd never actually seen that one in training before. Chittka says that insects make similar errors in the conjunction   of long-term memories as humans do. The ability to extract   common features between different events in the environment might come at the expense of remembering every detail correctly. In bees, with their limited brain capacity  , the pressure to store main features of several objects rather than each individual object might be much greater, compared with humans.

According to a recent survey,95% of women aged between 15 and early 40s see a doctor once a year,compared to 70% of men in the same age group. \"A lot of men think they're invincible ,\",Gullotta says.\"They only come in when a friend drops dead on the golf course and they think,'Geez,if it could happen to him...'\" \"Then there's the ostrich approach.Some men are scared of what might be there and would rather not know,\"says Dr Ross Cartmill. \"Most men get their cars serviced more regularly than they service their bodies,\"Cartmill says.He believes most diseases that commonly affect men could be addressed by preventive check-ups. \"Regular check-ups for men would surely place strain on the public purse,\"Cartmill says.\"But prevention is cheaper in the long run than having to treat the disease.Besides,the final cost is far greater:it's called premature death.\" What does Cartmill say about regular check-ups for men?", "subject": ""}

Now it happened, just when Sparta and Athens had finished their disastrous war, that Macedonia was ruled by an extraordinarily clever man named Philip.

A robot is milking cows. It is milking time at Woodbourne Creamery in Mt. Airy, Maryland. The cows are standing in line for a turn at the robot. John Fendrick is the owner of the farm. He inspects the progress of the animals by looking at a computer screen. That is all he has to do.\"The door opens up, they walk in, and they get milked. The door opens up, and they walk out.\" The robot does all the work. It uses a laser to find each teat   -- the place on the cow where the milk comes out. The robot then cleans the teat and connects a milking tube toit. The robot also tests the milk for possible contamination  . If it finds a problem, it rejects the milk. When the amount of milk coming out of the cow slows, the machine knows to stop, and sends the cow on its way. Milking robots are becoming popular among dairy farmers in the United States, Europe and Australia. John Fendrick says the robots have changed life on a dairy farm.\"You are given the freedom back. So it allows me or the people working for me to actually do other things on the farm.\" Most dairy farmers must milk their cows two times a day, early in the morning and late at night. The animals are milked every day in good weather or bad. But Mr Fendrick's cows do not follow such a schedule. They stay in the field until they want to be milked by the robot. Some of them come to be milked in the middle of the night. Mr Fendrick doesn't even need to be there to watch his cows being milked. He can watch from his telephone. He can learn when each cow was milked and how much she produced. He can also learn if a cow has not been milked for a long time. The cow milking robot is not low-cost technology. Mr Fendrick paid more than $150,000 for it. But he notes, paying someone to milk the cows is also costly.\"In three years, I will have paid off the difference with this, and I don't have to be the person who's always on call to milk. The fact is that we have a life, and our cows are able to function without us -- to us, it's well worth the money.\" And he says that is a good thing.\"I don't like to milk.\"With the robot, he can turn his attention to other things. He gets about 475 liters of milk a day, and he never has to touch a cow. The reason why Mr Fendrick doesn't even have to be on the farm is that    .", "subject": ""}

Fashion is a lot cheaper and people get tired of things more quickly.\"     Professor Twigg analyzed family expending data and found that while the percentage of spending on clothes and shoes by women had stayed around the same -- about 5 or 6 percent of spending -- the amount of clothes bought had risen sharply.     The professor said, \"Clothes are now 70 percent cheaper than they were in the 1960s because of the huge expansion of production in the Far East. In the 1960s Leeds was the heart of the British fashion industry and that was where most of the clothes came from, but now almost all of our clothes are sourced elsewhere. Everyone is buying more clothes but in general we are not spending more money on them.\"     Fashion designer Angela Barnard, who runs her own fashion business in London, said older women were much more affected by celebrity  style than in previous years.     She said, \"When people see stars such as Judi Dench and Helen Mirren looking attractive and fashionable in their sixties, they want to follow them. Older women are much more aware of celebrities. There's also the boom in TV programmes showing people how they can change their look, and many of my older customers do yoga to stay in shape well in their fifties. When I started my business a few years ago, my older customers tended to be very rich, but now they are what I would call ordinary women. My own mother is 61 and she wears the latest fashions in a way she would never have done ten years ago. \" Which is the best possible title of the passage?", "subject": ""}

Dawn left Earth more than seven years ago on a trip to explore Ceres and another dwarf planet, called Vesta . Both dwarf planets are in the main belt of asteroids , a group of large objects, between the planets Mars and Jupiter. Marc Rayman is the chief engineer and director of the Dawn mission.

{"answer": 0, "choices": ["A natural emotion of anger.", "Consequences of anger.", "Control of anger.", "Possible solutions to anger."], "question": "Anger is a natural emotion that everyone experiences in life. Some researchers believe the first sound a baby makes when born could be a sign of anger. Anger may be the original or first emotion we feel and respond to. Imagine, before hunger, thirst, love, desire or any other describable feeling, we may experience anger. Not only is anger a natural emotion, it is in many cases a perfectly healthy emotion. Anger can motivate people to make very positive changes in their lives. Anger can motivate individuals to do positive and memorable acts. Sometimes we have to be angry at injustice, at evil, or even at nature, before we can do what needs to be done to correct wrongs or make things better. But of course, that is not how we usually think of anger. Most people think of anger as an emotion we must keep under control. Children are sometimes sent to their rooms or punished for expressing anger in an excessive   way. Parents tell a child to \"get control\" of himself when the child shows anger. We may be angry with friends or at work, but we know it is usually inappropriate to show it. We have to control the anger or suffer what may be the negative consequences. Very early in life, we learn that anger is something that must be controlleD.We learn this for a good reason. We know that uncontrolled anger can lead to fights, car accidents, bad relationships with others, unacceptable social behavior, and many other problems. Many experts say that if one holds his anger in, it can even lead to severe mental and physical health problems. So what can we do to understand and calm this natural emotion that we call anger? Experts offer many solutions to excessive and harmful anger. Some of these solutions include talking about what triggers the anger with someone you trust and is a good friend, leaving a situation that causes anger, beating on a pillow, exercising more in one's daily life, therapy, medication, and many other methods. Whatever solution one chooses, it is good to know that by trying to find the solution to the problem of anger, the first step in the right direction to solving the anger problem has been taken.

Then, not unlike one of my students, she added, \"Do you really like it?\" \"Yes,\" I answered firmly. As sure as sun beams, the Golden Rule was shining, and things were finally warming up. That very afternoon, a few parents went to the principal's office asking if their sixth graders could be moved into my class. Of course the students were not transferred, but when the grapevine circulated the request, up went the old barbed wire fence. Complete with machine guns. I continued to do the best job I could. I worked. I taught. I cared. I waited for a breakthrough moment. Months passed. It was lunch recess. I asked a boy walking down the hall. \"Have you seen Mrs. So-and-So?\" I was, in fact, searching for Mrs. Icicle Eyes. I needed to consult with her. Grinning, he came toward me as if sharing a secret. \"She's outside shooting baskets with the girls!\" \"She's playing basketball with the girls?\" I asked incredulously. \"Yeah,\" he nodded. I smiled. I didn't say another word. But my smile inside was even bigger than the one on my face. Why did the writer smile inside when he heard of \"Mrs. Icicle Eyes\" playing basketball with students?", "subject": ""}

Mother lived longer and kept her mental sharpness until a few days before she died. Dad suffered from dementia probably for the last six months of his life. It's hard to say how long because his dear wife knew how to cover his forgetfulness or sometimes strange behavior up for him. There were times, however, when mother became totally frustrated with the changes she saw taking place and she would blame him for doing things on purpose just to make her angry. He loved juicy fruit gum, but she kept it hidden from sight and rationed it because he could chew five or six sticks in an hour and ask for another package. \"I have to watch him like a hawk.\" she said. Even though they lived in an assisted-living facility, my father would not bathe himself and would not let any staff person help him.
