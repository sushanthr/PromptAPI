Of course, you are right, but here in a thickly populated country like England one is seldom far from a telephone in case of dreadful necessity. I think perhaps I had better try to justify myself by trying to prove that what I like is good. I admit that in different circumstances--if I were a tycoon(business VIP),for instance, or bed ridden I might find a telephone essential. But then if I were a taxi-driver I should find a car essential. Let me put it another way: there are two things for which the English seem to show particular talent; one is mechanical invention, the other is literature. My own business happens to be with the use of words but I see I must now stop using them. For I have just been handed a slip of paper to say that somebody is waiting to speak to me on the telephone. I think I had better answer it. After all, one never knows, it may be something important. In the author's opinion, which of the following is NOT true?", "subject": ""}

It is specifically designed to protect people who got infected measles  from spreading the virus to others. Like the flu, measles spreads through the air by breathing, coughing or sneezing. There is typically a time, about two weeks, between becoming infected with the virus and the beginning of symptoms like skin rash , runny nose, heavy cough and high fever. \"This therapy application determines the desired characteristics of the drug, which are orally available, cost-effective manufacture and high stability,\" Richard Klemperer, professor of Georgia State University, told reporters last Wednesday. \"With these criteria in mind, we have developed a small drug that blocks the measles virus over the past years, which is essential for copy of the virus.\" The researchers tested the drug in rats infected with canine distemper virus  , which is a close relative of measles virus. They found that all of the infected rats treated with the drug survived the deadly infection, showed no clinical signs of disease and developed a strong protective immune response. The drug could be used to treat friends, family and other social contacts of a person infected with measles virus, which have not developed symptoms yet but are at risk of having caught the disease, Klemperer said truthfully. \"The emergence of strong antiviral immunity  in treated animals is particularly encouraging, since it suggests that the drug may not only save an infected individual from disease but contribute to closing measles immunity gaps in a population,\" Klemperer said. The researchers emphasized the drug is not intended as a substitute for vaccination, but as an additional weapon to get rid of the measles. They planned to test the drug's safety in larger animals, before moving into clinical trials in humans. \"If our next series of studies confirms that the human situation mirrors what we have seen in rats, then this drug may make a major contribution to getting rid of measles by preventing local outbreaks\" Klemperer said. Despite the existence of an effective vaccine, annual measles deaths worldwide have remained constant at around 150,000 since 2007. The reasons for this are the highly infectious nature of the virus, in the developing world largely due to issues of resources, and in many developed countries in particular in the European region due to parental concerns regarding vaccination safety.

They have the same symptoms, but they react very differently. While Tina reaches for water and vitamins, her husband, Wesley, reached for the phone. \"I'd better make a doctor's appointment,\" he says. Why do these two Chinese people react to sickness so differently? Tina grew up in the U.S. Wesley grew up in Taiwan. And they have discovered that differences between Chinese and American cultures extend   to every area of life. Even sickness and health. When Westerners experience pain, they usually express their discomfort. Most Asians don't. This creates a challenge for American nurses who care for Asian patients in the U.S. How do they know if that calm, quiet patient is really hurting? They have to keep asking their Asian patients how they feel. In addition, Americans usually don't want sickness to slow them down. Unlike Chinese people, Americans often don't take time off work to rest and get well. They'd rather sneeze and cough all day at the office. Americans who get sick in Asia may protest   when Chinese friends suggest they go to the hospital. \"I'm not that sick!\" they may say. In the U.S., only very sick or injured patients go to hospital. People go to a doctor's office for less serious problems. Like Tina, Americans more often turn to vitamins or over-the-counter drugs to help them get well.

But instead of blaming students for their behavior, we should say noto too much homework. This is important because by using mobile phone applications to do theirhomework, students don't add much to their knowledge, says an article in Guangzhou-based YangchengEvening News. Excerpts  : Using mobile phone applications to do homework is no different from copying from someone else'swork. This is the opinion of a vast majority of teachers. Students who seek cell phone apps help to do theirhomework will pay dearly during major exams when they cannot seek the help of such applications, theteachers say. The heavy load of homework Chinese students are burdened with, said to be the heaviest in the world,has led to the popularity of these applications. Senior high school students in China rarely go to bed before 11 pm.

Also, they spend an average of 13.8 hours a week doinghomework, most in the world. There is no association between the amount of homework one does and the amount of knowledge onegathers. In fact, a research by Australian experts shows that the result is exactly the opposite: the morehours students spend doing homework, the less effective they will be in gaining knowledge.

Must see!\"    I quickly figured out what all the excitement was about: Dad is a big football fan. I had never been interested in football, but Dad's excitement that morning made me more and more curious. I had to find out why this sport was making my normally reserved father act like a five-year-old on his first trip to Disneyland. Dad decided that we should all eat at a little German restaurant so that we could watch the World Cup while eating. Secretly, I think he was hoping to turn Mum and me into football fans. The match started a few minutes after we entered the restaurant. As I was eating my meal, a loud noise came from the television. Surprised, I looked up at the TV: \"Why is that man jumping up and down?\" Dad patiently explained: \"That's Papa Bouba Diop, my son. It's normal for them to jump up and down after they've scored.\" Dad explained almost everything to me. His monosyllabic   answers were a thing of the past. I loved the new Dad!

And the following are the elements that make a setting: Time is the starting point of your setting. You develop your story and combine characters with respect to your chosen time period. Likewise, your story could evolve from a specific time of the day. A locale, in other words, is the clothing of your story. This could be just about any place you have heard of or created. What follows your locales is the architecture of the place -- for example, if your character is born in a Victorian-style house then you will need to add in details like color1ed brickwork or a fireplace to go with your character. Atmosphere has got to do with the climatic influences in your story. This could mean the heavy rain, mild wind or big earthquakes. Wrapping your story with weather details is a safe way of lightening the mood of your story. Geography of a place, again, helps to set the tone and mood of your story. It could be mushy lowlands, strange forests, steep mountains, lifeless rivers, dead lakes, a snow-covered house in Switzerland. Your description of the geography is an important element of the setting. Likewise, your geographic setting could also involve imagery of ports, farms, temples, yards, etc. that will interact with your plot and characters. Your cultural setting greatly helps with your character. The social practices, religious beliefs, political situations of a particular time, cultural trends, tradition, history, cuisine, clothing, music, etc.are some of the cultural factors that you can use to lead your characters through a complex plot or to give a direction to the characters to advance the story. The characters you create are affected by these cultural factors as well as act as their guiding factor throughout the story. Senses are extremely vital as they not just add more belief to your story, but also help to bring memories of the reader.

Without asking for permission, took the sign, turned it around and wrote a new message. Then he put the sign by the feet of the blind man, and left.  Later that afternoon the reporter returned to the blind man and noticed that his hat was almost full of bills and coins.

{"answer": 3, "choices": ["Careless.", "Doubtful.", "Mixed.", "Favorable."], "question": "Humans love animals and they especially love animals with humanlike personalities. For this reason, many of the most popular films are either centered on animals or have animals as important characters. Even in a movie that has little or nothing to do with animals, a pet can add a certain emotional quality to a film's plot. As expected, dogs and cats, the two most popular pets, make up the majority of animal characters in films. But many other less common pets have had starring roles also. Snakes, rats, pigs, rabbits, horses and many others have touched our lives through their extraordinary ability to personify humans in ways that humans just can't do.     Most movies that feature pets as central characters are family movies that give families a platform around which delicate subjects can be discussed. Often kids have an easier time understanding subjects like death and illness if they see it through the eyes of one of these personified animals.     These days, computer animation and graphics allow an entirely new generation of pet movies to be made. Animals that before were never seen in a film but now appear on the big screen in life. Whether they are lions, elephants, polar bears or some other exotic animals, video stores now have hundreds of titles offering humanlike performances from any type of animal imaginable.     Most animal movies have at least a little comedy. Even the saddest of classics such as Bambi or Charlotte's Web contain plenty of humor to relieve the tension and make the movie bearable. These movies almost always carry with them themes of human experiences and a message of hope. Kids learn that though life carries on with pain and sorrow, we learn to live with those facts and enjoy life for its good times.     Perhaps one of the best parts of pet movies is the way they help wipe away our stereotypes  about certain types of pets. For example, the conflict between cats and dogs is often shown in a fun and non--violent way in the movies. If these lifelong enemies can find a way to live in harmony, then certainly we humans should have no trouble doing so. Perhaps it is the fact that animals have so much to teach us about ourselves that makes us love them so much in the movies. What is the author's attitude towards pet movies?", "subject": ""}

The killing of weeds and insects by chemicals led to the wide-spread poisoning of animals and birds. The throwing of waste products into the ocean hurt life in the sea, while waste gases changed the chemical balance of the atmosphere and shut out some of the sun's necessary life-giving rays. And so we could go on adding more examples until in despair  we might feel like giving up the struggle to control these harmful human activities.

Doctors told her that because of a medication she had been taking her child would not be normal. She chose to continue with the pregnancy and in 1985 in Seoul, South Korea, little Hee Ah Lee was born with only two fingers on each hand, disfigurement of her legs, and slight brain injury. The hospital told Sun that she could not care for the child at home and her relatives wanted her to place the child for adoption in a foreign country. Sun, however, thought her baby would live a successful life. When Lee was a pre-schooler, Sun wanted her daughter to take piano lessons for two reasons. One was that she felt it would help her strengthen her hands so she could hold a pencil. The other was that she felt that if she could master the piano, she could master anything. For six months piano schools turned them down and then the one teacher who did accept the task got discouraged and wanted to quit. It was a three-month contest of wills between mother and daughter that led to a conflict in which Sun actually threw her daughter on the floor in frustration. But Lee got back up on the piano bench and for the first time played a children's song. That was the turning point and one year later Lee won the grand prize in a piano concert for Kindergartners. It was at the age of 7 that Lee won Korea's 19th National Handicap Conquest Contest and was presented with her award by the President of Korea.

The family was impolite and refused to let the angels stay in the guest room. Instead the angels were given a space in the cold underground room. As they made their bed on the hard floor, the older angel saw a hole in the wall and repaired it. When the younger angel asked why, the older angel replied, \"Things aren't always what they seem.\" The next night the pair came to rest at the house of a very poor, but very kind farmer and his wife. After sharing what little food they had, the couple let the angels sleep in their bed where they could have a good night's rest. When the sun came up the next morning, the angels found the farmer and his wife in tears. Their only cow, whose milk had been their only income, lay dead in the field. The younger angel was very angry and asked the older angel, \"How could this happen? Why did you not watch out for the cow? The first man had everything, yet you watched over his house,\" she accused. \"The second family had little but was willing to share everything, and you did not help.\" \"Things aren't always what they seem,\" the older angel replied. \"When we stayed in the underground room , I noticed there was gold stored in that hole in the wall.

C. The study, conducted by researchers from the University of Illinois and Oklahoma State University, provided fresh confirmation of how much our environment influences our eating habits. The scientific team analyzed the lunch receipts from a restaurant in Oklahoma that agreed to use three menus designed by the researchers for three months in 2010. One group of diners -- the control group -- used the restaurant's original menus with item and price listings. The second group received menus with calorie counts and the third group used menus that had both calorie counts and a traffic light symbol designed to indicate calorie ranges. A green traffic light meant an food option was 400 calories or less, a yellow light indicated 401 calories to 800 calories and a red light was placed next to choices with more than 800 calories. By analyzing diners' receipts, the researchers picked out interesting patterns in what regular customers ordered. They also interviewed servers and found that people who were part of larger parties and received menus with traffic lights typically ordered healthier choices, which the researchers say suggests the influence of peer pressure. The researchers then created a model to assess how customers felt about their choices. Based on the popularity of menu items, the researchers determined the probability that individuals were satisfied with their choice. Interestingly, this standard of satisfaction was influenced by expected factors such as price and calories, but also by fellow diners' menu choices as well. They found that even if a customer firstly felt less satisfied about their choice of say, a salad, they felt better about it if their friends ordered an item within the same menu category. \"The message from this research is that people were happier if they were making similar choices to those sitting around them,\" study author Bill Ellison, an economist at the University of Illinois, said in a statement. \"If my peers are ordering higher-calorie items or spending more money, then I am also happier, or at least less unhappy, if I order higher-calorie foods and spend more money. \" So if you're hoping to eat better, try dining with friends who do too.

That is, generally, younger people tend to outnumber older people on the front end of a technologic I shift. It is not always the case, though.

In a study last year, of all people surveyed, 48 percent said they wanted to ride in one, while 50 percent did not. The fact that attitudes toward self-driving cars appear to be so steady across generations suggests how varying the shift to driverless cars could be. Not everyone wants a driverless car now-and no one can get one yet-but among those who are open to them, every age group is similarly involved. Actually, this isn't surprising. Whereas older generations are sometimes unwilling to adopt new technologies, driverless cars promise real value to these age groups in particular. Older adults, especially those with limited moving or difficulty driving on their own, are one of the classic use-cases for driverless cars. This is especially interesting when you consider that younger people are generally more interested in travel-related technologies than older ones. When it comes to driverless cars, differences in attitude are easily noticeable based on factors not related to age.

Lucien went on to say that without his father he couldn't see the stars in the sky. When those whom we love depart from us, we cannot see the stars for a while. But Lucien, the stars are still there, and one day, when you are older and your tears have gone, you will see them again. And, in a strange way, I expect that you will find your father is there too, in your mind and in your heart. I find that my parents, long dead now, still figure in many of my dreams and that I think of them perhaps more than I ever did when they were alive. I still live to please them and I' m still surprised by their reactions. I remember that when I became a professor, I was so proud, or rather so pleased with myself, that I couldn't wait to cable my parents. The reply was a long time in coming, but when it did, all Mother said was \"I hope this means that now you will have more time for the children!\" I haven' t forgotten. The values of my parents still live on. It makes me pause and think about how I will live on in the hearts and minds of my children and of those for whom I care. Would I have been as ready as Philip Lawrence have been to face the aggressors  ,and to lay down my life for those in my care? How many people would want me back for Christmas? It's a serious thought, one to give me pause. I pray silently, sometimes, in the dead of night, that ancient cry of a poet \"Deliver my soul from the sword  , and my darling from the power of the dog.\" Yet I know the death comes to us all, and sometimes comes suddenly. We must therefore plan to live forever, but live as if we will die tomorrow. We live on, I'm sure, in the lives of those we loved, and therefore we ought to have a care for what they will remember and what they will treasure.

I wanted to have a telescope, but now I want my daddy back.\" Lucien Lawrence's letter to Father Christmas written after his schoolteacher father had been knifed to death outside his school gate, must have touched every heart. Lucien went on to say that without his father he couldn't see the stars in the sky. When those whom we love depart from us, we cannot see the stars for a while. But Lucien, the stars are still there, and one day, when you are older and your tears have gone, you will see them again. And, in a strange way, I expect that you will find your father is there too, in your mind and in your heart. I find that my parents, long dead now, still figure in many of my dreams and that I think of them perhaps more than I ever did when they were alive. I still live to please them and I' m still surprised by their reactions. I remember that when I became a professor, I was so proud, or rather so pleased with myself, that I couldn't wait to cable my parents. The reply was a long time in coming, but when it did, all Mother said was \"I hope this means that now you will have more time for the children!\" I haven' t forgotten. The values of my parents still live on. It makes me pause and think about how I will live on in the hearts and minds of my children and of those for whom I care. Would I have been as ready as Philip Lawrence have been to face the aggressors  ,and to lay down my life for those in my care? How many people would want me back for Christmas? It's a serious thought, one to give me pause. I pray silently, sometimes, in the dead of night, that ancient cry of a poet \"Deliver my soul from the sword  , and my darling from the power of the dog.\" Yet I know the death comes to us all, and sometimes comes suddenly. We must therefore plan to live forever, but live as if we will die tomorrow. We live on, I'm sure, in the lives of those we loved, and therefore we ought to have a care for what they will remember and what they will treasure. If more parents knew this in their hearts to be true, there might be fewer knives on our streets today. What feeling did the author's mother express in her reply?", "subject": ""}

By measuring and charting the results of many experiments, they are trying to find out what makes different people perceive totally different things about the same scene.

Chances are you will receive three different answers. Each person sees the same scene, but each perceives  something different about it. Perceiving goes on in our minds. Of the three people who look out the window, one may say that he sees a policeman giving a motorist a ticket. Another may say that he sees a rush-hour traffic jam at the intersection. The third may tell you that he sees a woman trying to cross the street with four children in tow. For perception  is the minds' interpretation of what the senses -- in this case our eyes -- tell us.

He liked to take photographs, so a family friend bought the young   Jackson a super 8mm camera. He has been a filmmaker even since. At age nine he even attempted to remake his favorite film, King Kong, using his own stop-motion effect. Unlike many of the filmmakers working today, Jackson never went to film school. Instead he created his own short films with the help of family and friends. He was turned down for a job at the National Film Unit, New Zealand's government agency that produces tourist films about the country. With that avenue closed, Jackson began working other jobs to support himself, while shooting shorts on the weekend. One of these weekend films, expanded from its original ten minutes length into a feature film. The project took four years to complete (1983-1987)and was called Bad Taste.

The clerk, a friendly man with a beautiful smile, explained that there were three conferences in town. \"All of our rooms are taken,\" the clerk said, \"but I can't send a nice couple like you into the rain at one o'clock in the morning. Would you perhaps be willing to sleep in my room? It's not a suite, but it will be good enough to make you comfortable for the night.\" The couple agreed. As the elderly man paid the bill the next morning, he told the clerk, \"You are the kind of person who should be the boss of the best hotel in the United States.

The clerk had almost forgotten the incident when he received a letter from the elderly man, asking the clerk to pay him a visit. The elderly man met him in New York, and led him to the corner of the Fifth Avenue and 34thStreet.

Part of his job includes keeping an eye on Alaska's many active volcanoes and giving people a heads-up when a volcano might erupt . Like most jobs in the science, volcanology requires a lot of education. McGimsey received an undergraduate degree in geology at the University of North Carolina, then landed an internship  with a geologist at the USGS  whose work field was about volcanoes. After earning a graduate degree at the University of Colorado, McGimsey accepted a job with the USGS and has been with the Alaska Volcano Observatory for 25 years. Volcanoes can influence the world in ways we might not think about. For example, on Dec.15 1989, a 747 jetliner (a large airplane) flew through a thick ash cloud produced by Mount Redoubt, an Alaskan volcano that hadn't erupted in 25 years. The ash caused all four engines to die, and the plane's electronics went dead. \"The plane was within several thousand feet of flying into the mountains below when the pilots got a couple of engines restarted and landed safely in Anchorage,\" McGimsey says.

No more Spitz,no more trouble.\" Francois started to harness the dogs. He needed a new lead-dog, and decided that Solleks was the best dog that he had. But Buck jumped at Solleks and took his place. \"Look at Buck!\" said Francois,laughing. \"He's killed Spitz,and now he wants to be lead-dog.Go away, Buck!\" He pulled Buck away and tried to harness Solleks again.Solleks was unhappy too. He was frightened of Buck, and when Francois turned his back,Buck took Solleks' place again. Now Francois was angry. \"I'll show you! \" he cried,and went to get a heavy club from the sledge.

My name is Clara, and when I was in Grade 6, I won the essay contest NASA held to name its next Mars rover. The essay I wrote was not even 250 words long, but somehow it was enough to change my life. I still remember that cold December day, sitting in a science class. I'd finished a worksheet early and decided to get a Time for Kids magazine off Mrs. Estevez's bookshelf. It was the 2008 Invention Issue, but that wasn't the only thing that caught my eye. In the magazine, there was an article about a girl who named the Mars Exploration Rovers, Spirit and Opportunity. The article also talked about the essay contest NASA was holding to name its next Mars rover. Before I even knew anything else about it, a single word flooded my 11-year-old mind: Curiosity. I couldn't wait for the bell to ring so I could get started on my essay. That afternoon, I raced home from the bus stop, sat down at the computer and typed until my fingers ached. It turned out that I was just in time. A few days later, and the contest would have closed. Five months later, shortly after I had turned 12, I was watching a National Geographic special on mammoths when the phone rang. My mom answered, and immediately, a wide smile spread across her face. When she told me that I had won, I was happier than I could ever remember being, I screamed and ran up and down the stairs and all around the house. I completely forgot about the mammoths and did not even remember to turn off the TV until it was really late. Curiosity is such an important part of who I am. I have always been fascinated by the stars, the planets, the sky and the universe. I remember as a little girl, my grandfather and I would sit together in the backyard for hours. He'd tell me stories and point out the stars. My grandfather lived in China, thousands of miles away from my home in Kansas. I loved the stars because they kept us together even when we were apart. They were always there, yet there was so much I didn't know about them. That's what I love so much about space. No matter how much we learn, it will always possess some mystery. In the past, space exploration may have been a competition to see who got somewhere first or the fastest. But now, it is one of the few things that bring people together. Science is a language that needs no translation. It doesn't matter where you're from or what you look like - you just have to have a thirst for knowledge and a passion for learning in order to succeed. People often ask me why we go to faraway places like Mars. Why do we explore? My answer to that is simple: because we can; because we're curious; because we as human beings do not just stay holed up in one place. We are constantly wondering and trying to find out what's over the hill and beyond the horizon. The curiosity rover is more than just a robot. It is more than just a titanium body and aluminum wheels. Curiosity represents the hard work, passion, love and commitment of thousands of people from all over the world who were brought together by science. Science is so awesome. It is breathtaking and mind-blowing; and sometimes, it's just a little bit crazy. The discoveries we make about our world are incredibly humbling. They move us forward and have the potential to benefit all of mankind. This December it will be four years of my life that have been tied to Curiosity in some way. I've met so many amazing people through this experience, from scientists to engineers to administrators to volunteers. Their devotion and enthusiasm inspire me greatly. My journey with Curiosity and the MSL mission team has shaped the person that I am today, as well as the person I would one day like to become.

In the past, space exploration may have been a competition to see who got somewhere first or the fastest. But now, it is one of the few things that bring people together. Science is a language that needs no translation. It doesn't matter where you're from or what you look like - you just have to have a thirst for knowledge and a passion for learning in order to succeed. People often ask me why we go to faraway places like Mars. Why do we explore? My answer to that is simple: because we can; because we're curious; because we as human beings do not just stay holed up in one place. We are constantly wondering and trying to find out what's over the hill and beyond the horizon. The curiosity rover is more than just a robot.

My name is Clara, and when I was in Grade 6, I won the essay contest NASA held to name its next Mars rover. The essay I wrote was not even 250 words long, but somehow it was enough to change my life. I still remember that cold December day, sitting in a science class. I'd finished a worksheet early and decided to get a Time for Kids magazine off Mrs. Estevez's bookshelf. It was the 2008 Invention Issue, but that wasn't the only thing that caught my eye. In the magazine, there was an article about a girl who named the Mars Exploration Rovers, Spirit and Opportunity. The article also talked about the essay contest NASA was holding to name its next Mars rover. Before I even knew anything else about it, a single word flooded my 11-year-old mind: Curiosity. I couldn't wait for the bell to ring so I could get started on my essay. That afternoon, I raced home from the bus stop, sat down at the computer and typed until my fingers ached. It turned out that I was just in time. A few days later, and the contest would have closed. Five months later, shortly after I had turned 12, I was watching a National Geographic special on mammoths when the phone rang. My mom answered, and immediately, a wide smile spread across her face. When she told me that I had won, I was happier than I could ever remember being, I screamed and ran up and down the stairs and all around the house. I completely forgot about the mammoths and did not even remember to turn off the TV until it was really late. Curiosity is such an important part of who I am.

They'll repeat it endlessly, and in many cases, they'll be lying through their teeth. It's one of the worst kept secrets of family life that all parents have a preferred son or daughter, and the rules for acknowledging it are the same everywhere: The favored kids recognize their status and keep quiet about it -- the better to preserve the good thing they've got going and to keep their siblings  off their back.

She questioned them about their relationships and videotaped them as they worked through conflicts. Overall, she concluded that 65% of mothers and 70% of fathers exhibited a preference for one child, usually the older one. And the real numbers can be much bigger, since parents try especially hard to hide their preferences when a researcher is watching. If the scientists don't see through the trick, however, kids usually do -- and act accordingly. From the moments they're born, brothers and sisters constantly compete for the precious resource of parental attention, each fighting to establish an identity that will best catch Mom's or Dad's eye.

{"answer": 0, "choices": ["Water cycle.", "Water vapour.", "How rain forms.", "Water, vapour, rain."], "question": "Weather changes when the temperature and the amount of water in the atmosphere change. We can see and feel water coming from the atmosphere when we have rain. But the water must somehow get back to the atmosphere. Meteorologists call this the water cycle. There are many stages in the water cycle. Rain falls when water vapour in clouds condenses . Drops of water form and fall to the ground. The water soaks into the ground and feeds streams and rivers. A lot of rain falls into the sea. The heat of the sun evaporates some of the water in the ground and in the rivers, lakes, and the sea. It changes the liquid water into water vapour. The vapour rises onto the air. Water vapour is normally invisible. On a very damp or humid day, however, you can sometimes see water vapour rising from a puddle  or pond in a mist  above the water. Water vapour also gets into the air from living things. Trees and other plants take in water through their roots and give off water vapour from their leaves. People and land animals drink water and breathe out water vapour. In all these ways the water returns to the air. There it gathers to form clouds and condenses to form rain.

{"answer": 2, "choices": ["interests in doing things differently", "determination to try out new things", "inability to manage time properly", "lack of concentration on a project"], "question": "Everyone procrastinates.We put things off because we don't want to do them, or because we have too many other things on our plates.Putting things off--big or small--is part of being human. But procrastination does have consequences.When your procrastination leaves you feeling discouraged, it is time to take action, and one of the best ways to get rid of it is to make an un-schedule. An un-schedule is a weekly calendar of all the ways in which your time is already accounted for.You consider not only your timed commitments such as classes and meetings, but also your untimed activities such as meals, exercise, time with friends, and the like.Once you have made your un-schedule, you may be able to see your time is often filled with more activities than you realize, for instance, that you really don't have five hours to spend writing on the night before your paper is due.Procrastinators' views of time tend to be unrealistic, and the un-schedule can help you outline a realistic plan.By planning accordingly, you will not only get a better night's sleep, you may also end up with a better paper. The un-schedule might also be a good way to get started on a larger project, such as a term paper or an honors paper.You may think that you have \"all semester\" to get the writing done, but if you really map out how much time you have available to write on a daily and weekly basis, you will see that you need to get started sooner, rather than later.In addition, the un-schedule may reveal especially busy weeks or months, which will help you budget time for long-term projects. Perhaps most importantly, the un-schedule can help you examine how you spend your time.You may be surprised at how much time you spend watching television, and decide to make a change.It's especially important that you build time for fun activities into your un-schedule.Otherwise, you will procrastinate in order to steal time for relaxation. You can also use the un-schedule to record your progress towards your goal.Reward yourself for your small successes.Seeing what you've achieved will help reinforce the productive behavior, and you will feel more motivated in the following process.

He owned a farm about twenty miles outside the city of Washington, for which the village of Georgetown was the market center. When he used an icebox of his own design to transport his butter to market, he found that customers would pass up the rapidly melting stuff in the tubs of his competitors to pay a premium price  for his butter, still fresh and hard in neat, one-pound bricks.

{"answer": 2, "choices": ["to sell their produce at high price", "to go home earlier", "to keep their produce fresh", "to win more customers than their competitors"], "question": "By the mid-nineteenth century, the term \"icebox\" had entered the American language, but ice was still only beginning to affect the diet of ordinary citizens in the United States. The ice trade grew with the growth of cities. Ice was used in hotels, taverns , and hospitals, and by some forward-looking city dealers in fresh meat, fresh fish, and butter. After the Civil War (1861-1865), as ice was used to refrigerate freight cars, it also came into household use. Even before 1880, half of the ice sold in New York, Philadelphia, and Baltimore, and one-third of that sold in Boston and Chicago, went to families for their own use. This had become possible because a new household convenience, the icebox, a precursor   of the modern fridge, had been invented. Making an efficient icebox as not as easy as we might now suppose. In the early nineteenth century, the knowledge of the physics of heat, which was essential to a science of refrigeration, was rudimentary . The commonsense notion that the best icebox was one that prevented the ice from melting was of course mistaken, for it was the melting of the ice that performed the cooling. Nevertheless, early efforts to economize ice included wrapping up the ice in blankets, which kept the ice from doing its job. Not until near the end of the nineteenth century did inventors achieve the delicate balance of insulation  and circulation needed for an efficient icebox. But as early as 1803, and ingenious Maryland farmer, Thomas Moore, had been on the right track.

Dr. Scott Levin, team leader of Zion's operation, said Zion coped with the operation better than many adults. \"I've never seen Zion cry,\" Levin said. \"He's just an amazing boy. He has such courage and determination and gives us all inspiration.\" Zion said his courage came from the two most amazing people: his mom and his grandma. His mother, Pattie Ray, said, \"It's been a long journey but now I feel I am living in my dream. It's his dream, and it's mine, too. I' m just living through him, and I'm just here to support him in any way and help him do whatever he wants to do.\" However, Zion told reporters his mom wouldn't let him try out for football. His mom said it's too dangerous. She also pointed out that he might be playing against little kids, not professionals, and she told him they would discuss it later. Zion tried to counter her argument. \"My next goal: convince Mom to let me play football,\" he said. Which description about Pattie Ray is true?", "subject": ""}

The Lewisvillle, Texas, school teachers were aware that the hours they spent on preparing lessons were too often wasted on many students. So Forestwood High School, Texas, used the \"flipped   classroom\" method of instruction. \"We've completely done away with our lecture,\" Derow said. And homework assignments \"are all done in class,\" Bradley said. With the flipped concept, a student's usual homework assignment is to watch pre-recorded lectures on their computers or smart phones.They walk into class ready to discuss the topic, collaborate  with other students and work on assignments based on what they learned from the video. Free from lecturing, the teachers can use class time to look deeper into the subject and focus on difficult concept. As students change from a passive to an active role, they learn critical thinking skills, learn to collaborate and become independent learners. Instead of doing homework assignments alone at home, students are now \"working together, talking about it,\" Bradley said. \"If they don't agree on an answer, they debate it and have to justify their answers. It's a higher level of learning.\" Her students give the flipped classroom high marks. Sarah Lee, 14, watches the 30-minute videos on a home computer. She likes the ability to rewind the tapes if she doesn't understand a concept. She also likes being able to watch the lessons on her own schedule. One of her classmates, Dawson Depperschmidt has the same idea and thinks the time she spends in the classroom is more _ . \"It gives us more time to learn at school,\" Dawson said. \"You get more in-depth in class.

To say that science fiction is a subgenre of prose fiction  is to say that it has all the basic characteristics and serves the same basic functions in much the same way as prose fiction in general, that is, it shares a great deal with all other novels and short stories. Everything that can be said about prose fiction, in general, applies to science fiction. Every piece of science fiction, whether short story or novel, must have a narrator, a story, a plot, characters, setting, and language. The themes of science fiction are concerned with interpreting man's nature and experience around him. Themes in science fiction are constructed and presented in exactly the same ways that themes are dealt with in any other kind of fiction. They are the result to a particular combination of a narrator, story, plot, character, setting, and language. In short, the reasons for reading and enjoying science fiction, and the ways of studying and analyzing it, are basically the same as they would be for any other story or novel.

That is because the television program by that name can now be seen in so many parts of the world. That program became one of American's exports soon after it went on the air in New York in 1969. In the United States more than six million children watch the program regularly. The viewers include more than half the nation's pre-school children, from every kind of economic , racial , and geographical group. Although some educators object to certain elements in the program, parents praise it highly. Many teachers also consider it a great help, though some teachers find that problems arise when first graders who have learned from \"Sesame Street\" are in the same class with children who have not watched the program. Tests have shown that children from all racial, geographical, and economic backgrounds have benefited from watching it. Those who watch it five times a week learn more than occasional  viewers. In the US the program is shown at different hours during the week in order to increase the number of children who can watch it regularly. The programs all use songs, stories, jokes, and pictures to give children a basic understanding of numbers, letters and human relationships. But there are some differences. For example, the Spanish program, produced in Mexico City, devotes more time to teaching whole words than to teaching separate letters. Why has \"Sesame Street\" been so much more successful than other children's shows? Many reasons have been suggested. People mention the educational theories  of its creators, the support by the government and private  businesses, and the skillful use of a variety of TV tricks. Perhaps an equally important reason is that mothers watch it along with their children. This is partly because famous adult stars often appear on it.

Filters are made of a material called \"cellulose acetate .\" Mr. Kim explains that cellulose acetate can be made into another material: carbon. The pieces of cellulose acetate, known as fibers, are changed through a one-step burning process. After this, they are turned into an energy storage material. But why use carbon? Carbon has many qualities that seem  to make it the perfect material. Carbon has a high surface area. It conducts electricity well. It also stays stable, unlikely to change, for a long time. And carbon does not cost a lot. All these qualities make it the most popular material for making super-capacitors . Super-capacitors are good at storing energy.

I felt you should know how disappointed and upset I am.I trust you will look into this and ensure that such claims are handled more appropriately in the future.

Options are growing for blocking blue light, though experts caution that few have been adequately tested for effectiveness and the best solution remains avoiding brightly lit electronics at night. A Swiss study of 13 teenage boys, published in August inThe Journal of Adolescent Healthshowed that when the boys wore orange-colored glasses, also known as 'blue blockers' and shown to prevent melatonin, in the evening for a week, they felt \"significantly more sleepy\" than when they wore clear glasses.The boys looked at their screens, as teenagers tend to do, for at least a few hours on average before going to bed, and were monitored in the lab. Older adults may be less affected by blue light, experts say, but blue light remains a problem for most people, and an earlier study of 20 adults aged 18 to 68 found that those who wore orange-colored glasses for three hours before bed improved their sleep quality considerably relative to a control group that wore yellow-colored lenses, which blocked only ultraviolet  light.

A 2013 study he led, published in the journalCurrent Biology, showed just how different things can be without nighttime lights.

{"answer": 1, "choices": ["People used to be hard-working", "How important is the degree?", "How can we enter the top management?", "Degree surely leads to success"], "question": "As society advances and basic needs are most often being met, things that were not considered important in the past have taken priority . In the past, people could easily get a job and progress pretty well, as long as they were hard-working; education was important but not as crucial  as it is today. Nowadays, just as clothes are important to first impressions, degree is important to a person's first job interview or even a job with a good salary. Although experience is important to survive in any trade or profession, the first thing that companies look for is that piece of paper before looking at one's experience. A passport into the world of any profession is what having a degree means today, especially for professions that have need of certification and pay well, such as architects, doctors, lawyers, and teachers. That piece of paper, the degree, is also a passport to jobs in top or middle management in any company, especially so for multi-national corporations . Having a degree opens up opportunities that one would not have had if one did not have any kind of degree. A degree simply proves that one has gone through the necessary training and understanding of how to carry out a job. Although there are many that may say having a degree may not necessarily equal to success, _ would most definitely help any person achieve success in shorter and easier steps. Success cannot simply be a result of hard work and/or depending on one's experience or degree alone; it is the art and knowledge of how to work that determines one's success. Therefore, it should not be for the sake to get a degree, but the quality of the degree and experiences that one can learn from that matter as well.

{"answer": 1, "choices": ["knowing what the plants during the Little Ice Age were like", "understanding how ecosystems recover from glaciers.", "regrowing many species that have been destroyed before.", "figuring out the effects of melting ice caps on moss."], "question": "400-year-old plants from the Little Ice Age were brought back to life, which could help us understand how the Earth will deal with climate change. Moss  found buried beneath the Teardrop glacier  on Ellesmere Island in Canada has been brought back to life. Findings suggest that these plants could help repopulate regions exposed by melting ice caps. Plants that were buried beneath thick ice in Canada more than 400 years ago and were thought to have frozen to death have been brought back to life by Canadian scientists. Samples of the moss plant, covered by the glacier during the Little Ice Age of 1550 to 1850 AD, were replanted in a lab at the University of Alberta and grew new stems . Researchers now think these findings can give indication as to how regions can recover as the ice covering them melts. Biologist Dr. Catherine La Farge and her team at the University of Alberta were exploring the region around the Teardrop glacier on Ellesmere Island. Ice on Ellesmere Island region has been melting at around four meters each year for the past nine years. This means that many areas of land that were previously covered by ice have since been exposed. Many ecosystems that were thought to have been destroyed during the Little Ice Age between 1550 and 1850 AD can now be studied, including many species that have never been studied before. While examining an exposed area of land, La Farge and her team discovered a small area of moss called Aulacomnium turgidum.

Moss  found buried beneath the Teardrop glacier  on Ellesmere Island in Canada has been brought back to life. Findings suggest that these plants could help repopulate regions exposed by melting ice caps. Plants that were buried beneath thick ice in Canada more than 400 years ago and were thought to have frozen to death have been brought back to life by Canadian scientists. Samples of the moss plant, covered by the glacier during the Little Ice Age of 1550 to 1850 AD, were replanted in a lab at the University of Alberta and grew new stems . Researchers now think these findings can give indication as to how regions can recover as the ice covering them melts. Biologist Dr. Catherine La Farge and her team at the University of Alberta were exploring the region around the Teardrop glacier on Ellesmere Island. Ice on Ellesmere Island region has been melting at around four meters each year for the past nine years. This means that many areas of land that were previously covered by ice have since been exposed. Many ecosystems that were thought to have been destroyed during the Little Ice Age between 1550 and 1850 AD can now be studied, including many species that have never been studied before.

The U.S. Geological Survey conducts and supports research on the likelihood of future earthquakes. Scientists estimate earthquake probabilities in two ways: by studying the history of large earthquakes in a special area and the rate at which strain accumulates in the rock. Scientists study the past frequency of large earthquakes in order to determine the future likelihood of similar large shocks. For example scientists researched the large earthquakes in the San Francisco Bay region during the 75 years between 1836 and 1911. For the next 68 years, no earthquakes of magnitude   6 or large occurred in the region. Beginning with a magnitude 6 shock in 1979, the earthquakes in the region increased dramatically; between 1979 and 1989, there were four magnitude 6 or greater earthquakes, including a magnitude 7.1 earthquake. So scientists estimated that the probability of a magnitude 6.8 or larger earthquake occurring during the next 30 years in the region is about 67 percent. Another way to predict earthquakes is to study how fast strain accumulates. When plate movements build the strain in rocks to a critical level, like pulling a rubber band too tight, the rocks will suddenly break and slip to a new position. Scientists measure how much strain accumulates along a fault   each year, how much time has passed since the last earthquake, and how much strain was released in the last earthquake. This information is used to calculate the time required for the accumulating strain to build to the level that results in an earthquake. This simple model is so complicated that such detailed information about faults is rare. In the United States, only the San Andreas Fault System has adequate records for using this prediction method. Scientific understanding of earthquakes is of vital importance to the Nation. As the population increases, expanding urban development and construction encroach   upon areas susceptible  to earthquakes.

{"answer": 3, "choices": ["It is black and dirty.", "It can affect the health.", "It can kill people.", "It is too thick for people to see something."], "question": "London has always been known for its \"black fogs\". In the winter of 1952, a milky white fog rolled into the city. As the smoke poured into the air, it was so hard to see that people had to walk in front of the buses to guide them. In this way, the most serious air pollution disaster in history began. When it was over, more than 4,000 people had been killed by the thick black smog. New York City has had several London-type smogs since 1950. Each time, 100 to 400 deaths were caused by the smog. Although these smogs were not as deadly as London's, New York City has the worst air pollution problem in the United States. In all the killer smogs, factories and homes poured smoke and fumes into the air from the furnaces. The chemical fumes combined with the water droplets in the fog to form harmful substances. These substances caused the illness of those who breathed the polluted air. Usually, such harmful fumes rise into the upper air and are blown away by the wind. But sometimes there is an unusual weather condition called a temperature inversion. A layer of cold air remains near the ground as smoke and fumes pour into it. This is covered by an upper layer of warm air that acts like a lid. It prevents the polluted cooler air from rising. The harmful fumes pile up and make people ill. The smog may be so thick that airports are closed and chains of collisions occur on the highways. Another type of smog occurs in Los Angeles. Here the weather may be clear and sunny. But stinging eyes and dry coughs show that harmful chemicals fill the air. The smog is due to invisible gases, mostly from automobile exhaust. Because these chemicals are changed by the sun high up in the air, it is called photochemical smog. It contains automobile exhaust fumes and nitrogen oxides changed by the sun's rays. Added to these are sulfur dioxide and other fumes from factories and oil refineries. Photochemical smog is found in many large cities all over the world. Killer smogs don't happen very often, fortunately. But in Beijing, a combination of automobile exhaust fumes, home furnace smoke, and factory waste gases pours into the air.

As the smoke poured into the air, it was so hard to see that people had to walk in front of the buses to guide them. In this way, the most serious air pollution disaster in history began. When it was over, more than 4,000 people had been killed by the thick black smog. New York City has had several London-type smogs since 1950. Each time, 100 to 400 deaths were caused by the smog. Although these smogs were not as deadly as London's, New York City has the worst air pollution problem in the United States. In all the killer smogs, factories and homes poured smoke and fumes into the air from the furnaces. The chemical fumes combined with the water droplets in the fog to form harmful substances. These substances caused the illness of those who breathed the polluted air. Usually, such harmful fumes rise into the upper air and are blown away by the wind. But sometimes there is an unusual weather condition called a temperature inversion. A layer of cold air remains near the ground as smoke and fumes pour into it. This is covered by an upper layer of warm air that acts like a lid. It prevents the polluted cooler air from rising. The harmful fumes pile up and make people ill. The smog may be so thick that airports are closed and chains of collisions occur on the highways. Another type of smog occurs in Los Angeles. Here the weather may be clear and sunny. But stinging eyes and dry coughs show that harmful chemicals fill the air. The smog is due to invisible gases, mostly from automobile exhaust. Because these chemicals are changed by the sun high up in the air, it is called photochemical smog. It contains automobile exhaust fumes and nitrogen oxides changed by the sun's rays. Added to these are sulfur dioxide and other fumes from factories and oil refineries. Photochemical smog is found in many large cities all over the world.

{"answer": 3, "choices": ["should replace traditional food", "has been overpriced by farmers", "is grown with less harmful chemicals", "is really more nutritious and healthier"], "question": "Is It Worth Buying Organic Food? Organic food, grown without artificial chemicals, is increasingly popular nowadays. Consumers have been willing to pay up to twice as much for goods with organic labels  . However, if you think paying a little more for organic food gets you a more nutritious and safer product, you might want to save your money. A study led by researchers at Stanford University says that organic products aren't necessarily more nutritious, and they're no less likely to suffer from disease-causing bacteria, either. The latest results, published in the Annuals of Internal Medicine, suggest that buyers may be wasting their money. \"We did not find strong evidence that organic food is more nutritious or healthier,\" says Dr. Crystal Smith-Spangler from Stanford. \"So consumers shouldn't assume that one type of food has a lower risk or is safer.\" For their new study, Smith-Spangler and her colleagues conducted a review of two categories of research, including 17 studies that compared health outcomes between consumers of organic against traditional food products, and 223 studies that analyzed the nutritional content of the foods, including key vitamins, minerals and fats. While the researchers found little difference in nutritional content, they did find that organic fruit and vegetables were 20% less likely to have chemicals remaining on the surfaces. Neither organic nor traditional foods showed levels of chemicals high enough to go beyond food safety standards. And both organic and traditional meats, such as chicken and pork, were equally likely to be harmed by bacteria at very low rates. The researchers did find that organic milk and chicken contained higher levels of omega-3 fatty acids, a healthy fat also found in fish that can reduce the risk of heart disease. However, these nutritional differences were too small, and the researchers were unwilling to make much of them until further studies confirm the trends. Organic food is produced with fewer chemicals and more natural-growing practices, but that doesn't always translate into a more nutritious or healthier product. The U. S.

But most of the bugs stay safe inside the foam. Once the bugs have grown into adults, they stop making foam. They leave their homes and jump from plant to plant in search of food. The adults look a little like tiny frogs. For this reason they are also called froghoppers. If you see some foam on a plant, you might want to take a careful look inside. Gently push some of the foam aside with a small stick. Deep inside you may see a few insects eating plant juice. They might also be making more foam. Be sure to push the foam back after a moment to cover the insects and keep them safe. Soon the spittlebugs will grow up and leave their foam home. They will join the other insects in the grassland.

As a matter of fact, the foam is where young spittlebugs  live. These insects are protected by the foam, and they usually don't do much harm to the plants. As we all know, in late summer, a mother spittlebug lays her eggs on the plant. The babies will hatch  in spring. After they come to the new world, they begin to eat juice from the plant. The babies eat more juice than their bodies need for food. The extra juice mixes with a special waste that the spittlebugs produce.

However, when it comes to scary animals, the answers are often more or less the same - snakes and spiders are among the most dreadful ones for the majority of us. However, most of us have never been bitten by a snake or a spider. So does this mean we are born with a fear of certain things? Scientists have been actively looking into it for a long time. For example, studies have suggested that babies find live animals much more interesting than stuffed   ones. This interest continues even if those animals are snakes and spiders. A study published in Psychological Science in 2008 seemed to show that snakes did have a different impact on babies. When scientists presented babies with animal videos along with random sounds of happy or frightened human voices, they found that babies looked at snakes for longer than any other animal however the voices sounded. Now, a team from Rutgers University in New Jersey, US has tried to challenge the idea that babies are born with a fear of snakes and spiders. According to the BBC, the researchers measured babies' physiological   responses as they watched videos of snakes and elephants paired with both fearful and happy voices. Scientists then set out to surprise the babies to see how they would react. They presented them with an unexpected bright flash of light as they watched a video. As the BBC explained, a surprise like this would be more intense   if the babies were already scared, just like when we watch scary films and jump more if we are already scared. However, according to their findings, published recently in the Journal of Experimental Child Psychology, babies' surprised responses were not bigger when watching a video of a snake, even when it was shown with a fearful voice. Their heart response was also lower, which also made it seem that babies were not scared. \"Children do not have an _ fear of snakes,\" concluded the study. Even if previous studies had suggested that babies have different responses to snakes, it isn't necessarily related to fear. \"It's possible that paying more attention to something might make fear learning easier later on. It leads to fear learning,\" said research co-author Vanessa LoBue. She further explained that it was a good thing that humans didn't have an inborn fear of snakes because it would make a young infant's  desire to explore new things less strong.

The photo will remain the same to you each time you look at it, but memories change over time. \"Each time I remember what my high school graduation was like, I might be color1ing and changing that memory because of my current perspective -- because of new ideas that I have or things that I learned afterwards,\" she says. \"Human memory is much more dynamic   than photographs.\" But Henkel doesn't want people to stop taking photos.

There is in journalism a widespread view that when you consider giving an explanation, you are entering dangerous water, the swirling tides of opinion. This is nonsense. The opponents of explanation insist that the writer and the editor shall confine himself to the \"facts\". This insistence raises two questions; What are the facts? And are the bare facts enough? As for the first question, consider how a so-called \"factual\" story comes about.

Human-wildlife conflict is another common reason for building fences. Wildlife can damage valuable farm animals and crops. Some species carry diseases of agricultural concern, and a few threaten human lives. At the same time, people kill wild animals for food, trade, or to defend lives or property, and human activities destroy wildlife habitat . Separating people and wildlife by fencing can appear to be a _ beneficial way to avoid such harmful effects. But in a paper in the journal Science, published recently, some scientists argue that fencing should only be used if worse comes to worst. According to the scientists, although fencing can have conservation benefits, it also has costs. When areas of wildlife habitat are changed into islands, the resulting small and isolated populations tend towards extinction, and the resulting loss of larger-bodied species can affect interactions between species in ways that cause further local extinctions. Therefore, scientists are asking that conservationists carefully weigh up the biodiversity costs and benefits of new and existing fences. In addition to fences' ecosystem-wide impact, the scientists don't think they always achieve their specific aims. Construction of fences to reduce human-wildlife conflict has been successful in some places but the challenges of appropriate fence design, location, construction, and protection mean that fences often fail to deliver the anticipated benefits.

Some projects working with local people and government agencies in Indonesia have shown that human-elephant conflict can be dramatically reduced without using fences.

She has never turned on a computer, registered an email account, used data storage media or searched the Internet. Since 1955, she has settled in Silicon Valley, married to an extremely technical specialist in applied physics and engineering, designing photometric systems for NASA. Only when Dad suffered from cancer could we convince her she needed a cell phone. Mom's being separated from the information age is voluntary and deliberate. Mom is still that farm girl, and she takes the most pride in it. She sees her neighbor and her community \"real\". She shows no interest in the digital and virtual life. My mother saw Depression, World War II and the beginning of the Cold War before reaching voting age. She enjoyed country music on \"The Sons of the Pioneers\", a Canadian broadcast. The battery was so precious a resource that radio was limited to the barn because Grandma thought it helped cows produce milk. In the age when Churchill moved millions for the first time with radio broadcasts, she only experienced live media monthly, if at all. In her early twenties, Mom completed nurses' training and worked in that field before marriage, family and church became her life's concerns. She never really warmed up to television, though I think she appreciated a few of the series we watched, comedies like All in the Family. Computers, the Internet and mobile apps are simply not part of her experience. Mom disagrees with the opinion that technology simplifies life. In her life, she sees online records, email and paperless systems as mysteries in which no written reference can assist her. However, I can partly understand: I like such kind of experience and relationship one has with physical books. I am a child of television who only recently switched to online viewing. I've written down my awkward, love-hate relationship with my devices. _ , but it works for her. She's happiest as she is. What is the author's attitude towards his mother's such kind of experience?", "subject": ""}
{"answer": 3, "choices": ["didn't like hunting", "enjoy being special", "was not brave enough", "was fair and respectable"], "question": "Teddy Bears have been a very popular children's toy for many years. Most adults can remember their first stuffed bear, and over the decades these toys have become nearly a symbol of their childhood. However, children are not the only ones with whom these toys have become popular, as many adults make it a habit to collect these toys as well. The Teddy Bear first became popular during the early 20th century and was associated with then President Theodore Roosevelt. The story can date back to a hunting trip that President Roosevelt had taken where he was invited to be the one to shoot a black bear that had been tied to a tree. Being a crazy outdoors lover and hunter, Roosevelt refused to kill the animal because he believed that shooting the helpless bear was unsportsmanlike and wrong. This story quickly spread through newspapers across the country, and in the end inspired the introduction of a stuffed toy called \"Teddy's bear\". These toys became popular soon after first introduced, and within ten years, they were being produced by dozens of companies around the world. Within a generation, these stuffed bears were \"the\" toy to have, and have always been within children's toy boxes ever since. They are most often mass-produced in factories in order to keep up with the high demand.  However, there are still companies that take great pride in their handmade designs; and while handmade teddy bears are often preferred, they are also generally more expensive than their mass-produced ones. Today, these bears and other similar toys generate well over a billion dollars a year in profits for the companies that make them.

I had no intention of shooting the elephant--I had merely sent for the rifle to defend myself--and it is always uneasy to have a crowd following you. I marched down the hill, looking and feeling a fool, with the rifle over my shoulder and an ever-growing army of people knocking and pushing at my heels.

It had been some time since Jack had seen the old man. College, girls, career, and life itself got in the way. In fact, Jack moved clear across the country in pursuit of his dreams. There, in the rush of his busy life, Jack had little time to think about the past and often no time to spend with his wife and son. He was working on his future, and nothing could stop him.  Over the phone, his mother told him, \"Mr. Belser died last night. The funeral is Wednesday.\" Memories flashed through his mind like an old newsreel as he sat quietly remembering his childhood days.  \"Jack, did you hear me?\" \"Oh, sorry, Mom. Yes, I heard you. It's been so long since I thought of him. I'm sorry, but I honestly thought he died years ago,\" Jack said.  \"Well, he didn't forget you. Every time I saw him he'd ask how you were doing. He'd reminisce about the many days you spent over 'his side of the fence' as he put it,\" Mom told him.  \"I loved that old house he lived in,\" Jack said. \"You know, Jack, after your father died, Mr. Belser stepped in to make sure you had a man's influence in your life,\" she said  \"He's the one who taught me carpentry,\" he said. \"I wouldn't be in this business if it weren't for him. He spent a lot of time teaching me things he thought were important...Mom, I'll be there for the funeral,\" Jack said.  As busy as he was, he kept his word. Jack caught the next flight to his hometown. Mr Belser's funeral was small and uneventful. He had no children of his own, and most of his  s had passed away.  The night before he had to return home, Jack and his Mom stopped by to see the old house next door one more time. Standing in the doorway, Jack paused for a moment. It was like crossing over into another dimension, a leap through space and time. The house was exactly as he remembered. Every step held memories. Every picture, every piece of furniture....Jack stopped suddenly.  \"What's wrong, Jack?\" his Mom asked. \"The box is gone.\" he said.  \"What box?\" Mom asked.  \"There was a small gold box that he kept locked on top of his desk. I must have asked him a thousand times what was inside. All he'd ever tell me was 'the thing I value most'.\" Jack said.  It was gone. Everything about the house was exactly how Jack remembered it, except for the box. He figured someone from the Belser family had taken it.  \"Now I'll never know what was so valuable to him.\" Jack said. \"I better get some sleep. I have an early flight home, Mom.\"  It had been about two weeks since Mr. Belser died. Returning home from work one day, Jack discovered a note in his mailbox \"Signature required on a package. No one at home. Please stop by the main post office within the next three days.\" the note read.  Early the next day Jack retrieved the package. The small box was old and looked like it had been mailed a hundred years ago. The handwriting was difficult to read, but the return address caught his attention. \"Mr. Harold Belser\" it read. Jack took the box out to his car and ripped open the package. There inside was the gold box and an envelope. Jack's hands shook as he read the note inside.  \"Upon my death, please forward this box and its contents to Jack Bennett. It's the thing I valued most in my life.\" A small key was taped to the letter. His heart racing, as tears filling his eyes, Jack carefully unlocked the box.

The research showed that self-control isn't about giving up desires, but more about managing conflicting goals. Since most people consider highly self-controlled ones as being more task-centered, the scientists decided to find out the connection between self-control and people's happiness to determine if being self-disciplined leaves people feel less joyful. Through a set of tests-including one that assessed 414 middle-aged participants on self-control and another that randomly interviewed volunteers on their smart phones about their mood and any desires they might be experiencing, researchers found a strong connection between higher levels of self-control and satisfaction. The smart phone experiment also showed how self-control may improve mood. Those who showed the greatest self-control reported more good moods and fewer bad ones. But this didn't appear to be linked to being more able to resist temptation --it was because they exposed themselves to fewer situations that might inspire desires in the first place. They were doing a number of things that bring them happiness and avoiding problematic desires and conflicts. That became clear in the study's last experiment, which looked into how self-control affects the way people handle goals that conflict with one another. In particular, the researchers were interested in how self-disciplined and less-disciplined people differed when it came to choosing among \"virtues\" and \"vices\" like the pleasure of eating sugar cookie vs. the pain of gaining weight. Participants were asked to list three important goal conflicts they experienced regularly and were also questioned on how they managed to balance the goals. The highly self-controlled showed an obvious difference from those with less discipline over their lives. They tended to avoid creating situations in which their goals would conflict, and reported fewer instances of having to choose between short-term pleasure and long-term pain.

Since most people consider highly self-controlled ones as being more task-centered, the scientists decided to find out the connection between self-control and people's happiness to determine if being self-disciplined leaves people feel less joyful. Through a set of tests-including one that assessed 414 middle-aged participants on self-control and another that randomly interviewed volunteers on their smart phones about their mood and any desires they might be experiencing, researchers found a strong connection between higher levels of self-control and satisfaction. The smart phone experiment also showed how self-control may improve mood. Those who showed the greatest self-control reported more good moods and fewer bad ones. But this didn't appear to be linked to being more able to resist temptation --it was because they exposed themselves to fewer situations that might inspire desires in the first place. They were doing a number of things that bring them happiness and avoiding problematic desires and conflicts. That became clear in the study's last experiment, which looked into how self-control affects the way people handle goals that conflict with one another. In particular, the researchers were interested in how self-disciplined and less-disciplined people differed when it came to choosing among \"virtues\" and \"vices\" like the pleasure of eating sugar cookie vs. the pain of gaining weight. Participants were asked to list three important goal conflicts they experienced regularly and were also questioned on how they managed to balance the goals. The highly self-controlled showed an obvious difference from those with less discipline over their lives. They tended to avoid creating situations in which their goals would conflict, and reported fewer instances of having to choose between short-term pleasure and long-term pain. As a result, they experienced fewer negative emotions. And self-control doesn't always mean _ : it may mean saving now to get big payoff later. For dieters, it means making choices to avoid entering a bakery since you are more likely to buy a cupcake. Granted, self-control isn't the best way to instant satisfaction, but it may bring something even better: long-term contentment. Different from the less-controlled ones, the highly self-controlled people  _  .", "subject": ""}

This age-old strategy has worked well for Real Networks, Microsoft's main competitor in multimedia software for the Internet. Now, the smaller Seattle-based firm is trying a novel way to contain the software giant. On October 29th, it released the underlying recipe, or source-code, of its RealPlayer software and will soon do the same for its other programs--giving away a big chunk of its intellectual property . This may sound like a desperate echo of 1998, when Netscape, struggling in Microsoft's chokehold, published the source-code of its web browser. Yet Real Networks is not playing defence. It is trying to encourage the creation of a common multimedia software infrastructure for every kind of file format and device, thus thwarting  Microsoft's ambitions in this promising market. The firm hopes that others in the industry (volunteer programmers, media firms and hardware makers) will take the code, called Helix DNA, improve it and make it run on new devices, such as mobile phones and home stereos, turning Real Networks' software into an industry standard.

Individual developers, universities and other non-profit organisations can modify the software as they please, and even redistribute it for free, so long as they also publish the source-code for their changes. This is a sort of payment in kind, for Real Networks is then allowed to use these contributions. Firms, on the other hand, must pay royalty fees if they distribute more than 1m copies of the code.

{"answer": 3, "choices": ["the situation has improved but the job market is still weak", "salary increases should recover as the economy does", "producing high-quality work will surely help you get a raise", "that in and off an employee makes no difference"], "question": "As the economy begins to recover, salary increases should do the same. In the past few years, employers have raised workers' salaries by about 4 percent per year--except for 2009, when the figure dropped to a historically low 2.1 percent, according to a survey of World at Word. About one-third of companies froze raises altogether. For 2010, World at Work's survey projects an average salary increase budget of 2.7 percent, a figure that shows the situation has improved but the job market is still weak. Between 10 percent and 15 percent of companies said they would freeze raises--far fewer than in 2009, but still more than in most years. How can you get a raise? Avalos and others offer the following tips: * Do your job well. This means producing high-quality work, of course, but also keeping the big picture in mind. \"It really comes down to positioning yourself as a high performer, somebody who is aware of business goals and helps the company meet their goals as an organization\", Avalos said * Be visible. When times are tough, some workers think. \"I'm going to hunker down and hope that nobody notices me, because I don't want to be on a layoff list,\" said Richard Phillips, owner of Advantage Career Solutions. This is a mistake, because you're unlikely to get a raise if no one knows what you have accomplished. \"If anything, what you want to do is be more visible.\" * Make your boss's life easier. This means everything from having a good attitude to taking on extra tasks. If you don't know how you can help your boss, ask. * Ask for a raise.

Learn how to look good and look natural in your yearbook photo with these simple tips. 1. Practice smiling in a mirror. It sounds crazy, but figuring out how to make a natural looking smile for the camera does need a little preparation. Don't be shy! Just imagine you are in front of a camera --hold your head high, look straight into the mirror and smile. Keep practicing until you find out your most attractive smiling face. 2. Choose your color wisely. In yearbook photos, lots of people look good in darker colors because they draw attention to the face. Generally, white often isn't the best choice because it can make your skin look a bit gray, especially if you're pale. Besides, stay away from super -bright colors ( bright yellow, bright blue) unless you're really sure they make you look perfect. 3. Avoid unnecessary details. Busy patterns draw attention to themselves in yearbook photos, not to your face and smile. Save them for your everyday fashion experiments. Besides, have your clothes prepared for the day when the yearbook photo is taken. The last thing you want to do is pick out the perfect thing to wear, only to find that it's in the laundry. 4. Avoid big changes to your appearance. Big changes may not turn out the way you hope. Leave some time to do your hair, such as combing  it up right before the yearbook photo is taken.

The energy waste is equivalent to the fuel use of a small country. Amanda R. Carrico, a research assistant professor at the Vanderbilt Institute for Energy and Environment in Tennessee, told National Geographic that hand washing is often \"a case where people act in ways that they think are in their best interest, but they in fact have inaccurate beliefs or outdated perceptions.\" Carrico said, \"It's certainly true that heat kills bacteria, but if you were going to use hot water to kill them it would have to be way too hot for you to tolerate.\" Carrico said that after a review of the scientific literature, her team found \"no evidence that using hot water that a person could stand would have any benefit in killing bacteria.\" Even water as cold as 40degF (4.4degC) appeared to reduce bacteria as well as hotter water, if hands were scrubbed, rinsed and dried properly.

{"answer": 3, "choices": ["move faster than cyclists", "prefer to fly in a V formation", "are smarter than other animals", "play different roles in a formation"], "question": "Have you ever looked toward the sky on a fall day and witnessed a group of migrating birds? If so, you probably noted the V-shaped formation of the birds or the birds flying in a ball-like formation. Why do birds fly this way? Many theories have been developed to explain the formation patterns of different types of birds.   One theory is that birds fly in certain formations to take advantage of the laws of nature. The birds know that flying in a V-shaped pattern will save energy. Like the lead cyclist in a race who decreases wind force for the cyclists who follow, the lead bird cuts wind force for the birds that follow. This decrease in wind force means that the birds use up to 70 percent less energy during their flight. When the lead bird becomes tired, a more rested bird takes over that position.   But saving energy is important for more than one reason. Sometimes food is short during migration flights. Keeping energy enables the birds to fly longer distances between meals.     When food is sighted, the birds guide one another in a different way. When a bird identifies a familiar feeding area, it might turn around in order to signal the group to change direction. Then, this bird becomes the new leader. It helps guarantee that other birds will know exactly where it is going. Then the whole group makes a change in direction, gently streaming from the sky down to the ground. This formation is like an arrow pointing to the location of food.   Scientists have also studied the birds that sometimes fly in a ball-like formation. Researchers believe that the birds come together if a predator  is spotted. The predator may then become impatient waiting for a single bird to fly away from the group. The birds will often dip and dive as a group, frustrating even the most persistent enemy. Scientists report that this is a very effective method of defense against an attack.   The birds care for their fellow fliers through teamwork.

In the survey,conducted by job seeking and offering website Zhaopin.com,32.8 percent of the 6000 respondents choose to stay home at weekends and have a good rest,the Beijing Morning Post reported. Twenty percent use their days off to do housework. And only 19.3 percent are willing to have fun during the break time from work.Their first choice of fun is shopping. Other choices,though practiced by few,include meeting friends,accompanying the children,trips to the suburbs,and lessons for more skills. When they go shopping,54.5 percent of the white collars actually shop in supermarkets,while 27.9 percent attend other stores,especially when discounts are offered.    These activities don't seem to cost much,as 60 percent spend average less than 200 yuan(US$26)during weekends,and 30 percent no more than 500 yuan. When asked whom they would spend the weekends with,about 40 percent mention their partners,and 30 percent prefer a weekend all by themselves.Less than 20 percent hang out with friends.

{"answer": 2, "choices": ["The long distance.", "Too many participants.", "The dangerous blocking.", "Serious injuries in forearms."], "question": "More and more people take part in marathons these days - over 30,000 people will run the London Marathon this weekend, for instance. But it's not just the 26 miles and 385 yards that could be a daunting prospect. \"I have to admit to being completely frustrated by the blocking and for 18-19 miles was just keeping away from people and being held up,\" one participant grumbled after the 2012 London Marathon. \"I had to overtake a lot of people and ended up with bruised forearms from all the elbows,\" said another. How do such crowding problems arise, and could they be reduced? Some researchers believe that we can find the answers through a more familiar system in which jams appear - road traffic flow. Martin Treiber, of the Technical University of Dresden in Germany, has previously developed models for traffic flow. One of the first attempts to model traffic flow was made in the 1950s by James Lighthill and his collaborator Gerard Whitham of Manchester University. They considered the traffic as a kind of liquid flowing down a pipe, and looked at how the flow changes as the fluid gets denser . At first the flow rate increases as the density increases, since you simply get more stuff through in the same period of time. But if the density becomes too high, there's a risk of jams, and the flow rate drops sharply. Treiber's model of a marathon uses this same principle that the flow rate first increases and then decreases as the density of runners increases, thanks to an sudden switch from free to crowded flow. He assumes that there is a range of different preferred speeds for different runners, which each maintains throughout the race. With just these factors, Treiber can calculate the flow rate of runners, knowing the \"carrying capacity\" at each point on the route. This allows Treiber to figure out how blocking might depend on the race conditions - for example, for different starting procedures. Some marathons start by letting all the runners set off at once (which means those at the back have to wait until those in front have moved forward). Others assign runners to various groups according to ability, and let them start in a series of waves. Treiber has applied the model to the annual Rennsteig half-marathon in central Germany, which attracts around 6,000 participants. The traditional route had to be changed in 2013, because the police were no longer willing to close a road to ensure that runners could cross safely. It could pass either over a 60m wooden bridge or through a tunnel. Treiber used his model to predict the likely blocking caused in the various options. The model predicted that a mass start would risk an overload of runners if the bridge were to be used. Only by moving the starting point further back from the bridge could the danger be avoided - and even then, if some of the numbers assumed in the model were only slightly inaccurate, there was still a risk of jams at the bridge. On the other hand, no dangerous blocking seemed likely for the tunnel route. The run organizers consulted Treiber's team, and eventually chose this option.

But it's not just the 26 miles and 385 yards that could be a daunting prospect. \"I have to admit to being completely frustrated by the blocking and for 18-19 miles was just keeping away from people and being held up,\" one participant grumbled after the 2012 London Marathon. \"I had to overtake a lot of people and ended up with bruised forearms from all the elbows,\" said another. How do such crowding problems arise, and could they be reduced? Some researchers believe that we can find the answers through a more familiar system in which jams appear - road traffic flow. Martin Treiber, of the Technical University of Dresden in Germany, has previously developed models for traffic flow. One of the first attempts to model traffic flow was made in the 1950s by James Lighthill and his collaborator Gerard Whitham of Manchester University. They considered the traffic as a kind of liquid flowing down a pipe, and looked at how the flow changes as the fluid gets denser . At first the flow rate increases as the density increases, since you simply get more stuff through in the same period of time. But if the density becomes too high, there's a risk of jams, and the flow rate drops sharply. Treiber's model of a marathon uses this same principle that the flow rate first increases and then decreases as the density of runners increases, thanks to an sudden switch from free to crowded flow. He assumes that there is a range of different preferred speeds for different runners, which each maintains throughout the race. With just these factors, Treiber can calculate the flow rate of runners, knowing the \"carrying capacity\" at each point on the route. This allows Treiber to figure out how blocking might depend on the race conditions - for example, for different starting procedures. Some marathons start by letting all the runners set off at once (which means those at the back have to wait until those in front have moved forward). Others assign runners to various groups according to ability, and let them start in a series of waves. Treiber has applied the model to the annual Rennsteig half-marathon in central Germany, which attracts around 6,000 participants. The traditional route had to be changed in 2013, because the police were no longer willing to close a road to ensure that runners could cross safely. It could pass either over a 60m wooden bridge or through a tunnel. Treiber used his model to predict the likely blocking caused in the various options. The model predicted that a mass start would risk an overload of runners if the bridge were to be used. Only by moving the starting point further back from the bridge could the danger be avoided - and even then, if some of the numbers assumed in the model were only slightly inaccurate, there was still a risk of jams at the bridge. On the other hand, no dangerous blocking seemed likely for the tunnel route. The run organizers consulted Treiber's team, and eventually chose this option.

When Vischer's patent expired in 1954,  many companies entered the field,  and the rapid pressure cooker became popular with people with people who had little time to cook or had to supply food for unexpected guests.

But why should it be different? Being young people in America, shouldn't they take up all of the challenges and opportunities that this country offers? Consider some of these views shared in the story: Jennifer, 29, owner of a two-bedroom apartment with her husband, worries that she won't be able to have children for at least a decade because they can't afford to buy a house yet. I read that, and I thought what planet she is living on where you need to own a house in order to have kids? Has she ever visited a developing country, or even downtown areas in this one?

Such special dialects, or jargon, are necessary in technical discussion of any kind. Being universally understood by the devotees of the particular science or art, they have the precision of a mathematical formula . Besides, they save time, for it is much more economical to name a process than to describe it. Thousands of these technical terms are very properly included in every large dictionary, yet, as a whole,  _  Different professions, however, differ widely in the character of their special vocabularies. In trades and handicrafts and other professions, such as farming and fishing, that have occupied great numbers of men from remote times, the technical vocabulary is very old. It consists largely of native words, or of borrowed words that have worked themselves into the very fiber of our language, hence, though highly technical in many particulars, these vocabularies are more familiar in sound, and more generally understood than most other technicalities. The special dialects of law, medicine, and philosophy have also become pretty familiar to cultivated person, and have contributed much to the popular vocabulary. Yet, every profession still possesses a large body of technical terms that remain essentially foreign, even to educated speech. And the proportion has been much increased in the last fifty years, particularly in the various departments of natural and political sciences and in the mechanic arts. So new terms are coined with the greatest freedom, and abandoned with indifference when they have served their turn. Most of the new coinages are restricted to special discussions and seldom get into general literature or conversation. Yet no profession is nowadays, as all profession once were, a closed guild  . The lawyer, the physician, the man of science, and the cleric   associate freely with his fellow creatures, and do not meet them in a merely professional way. Furthermore, what is called popular science makes everybody acquainted with modern views and recent discoveries.

But none of that stopped Alexis from becoming the target of online bullying  . Alexis began to receive hundreds of online unpleasant comments via the latest social networking site called www.formspring.com. In March 2010, Alexis committed suicide and although all agreed that the online bother was not the single factor that led to Alexis' death, everyone did agree that it was a contributory factor. Unfortunately, Alexis' story is not unique. A 2010 study conducted by the Cyberbullying Research Center showed that cyberbullying victims were almost twice as likely to have attempted suicide compared to youth who had not experienced cyberbullying. Suicide is obviously the extreme and no one can minimize the tragedy of it. However, there are other damages that occur as a result of aggressive bullying. It can damage self-esteem and lead to feelings of worthlessness, and also increase social isolation and make victims become withdrawn, depressed, anxious, and insecure. So what causes girls to be so unkind towards each other? A term known as relational aggression may best describe the cause of girl-on-girl bullying. It starts with a clique   usually led by a girl with a high level of social status and popularity. In order not to lose her position, she will control girls within the clique and take action if she feels threatened. At the leader's directive the girls within the clique will spread rumors and lies and annoy other girls continuously.

What was the occasion? For the first time in nearly 90 years, a sitting United States president was coming to Cuba, an island nation 90 miles south of Florida. On Sunday, President Barack Obama, joined by his family, stepped off Air Force One and onto a rainy runway, where Cuban dignitaries   eagerly awaited him. \"It's wonderful to be here, \" the president said. The last time a U.S. president came to Cuba was in 1928. It was President Calvin Coolidge, and he arrived on a battleship. Obama will be in Cuba through Tuesday. He is set to meet with Cuba's president, Raul Castro, attend a state dinner and even take in a baseball game. The U.S. cut all ties with Cuba after Fidel Castro's communist government took control of the island in 1959. In the years that followed, both countries' opposing political views furthered the separation. Plans for social and economic change began after President Fidel Castro transferred power to his brother, Raul in 2008. Raul Castro then set a plan in motion to revive the country's economy. Since then, Cuba has been taking small, yet lasting steps toward change by removing a number of restrictions that had been set on its citizens, such as access to the Internet, the use of cellphones, and by allowing people to work at jobs not controlled by the government. Cuba, however, still has tough limits on media, public assembly and political opposition. Obama hopes to share his vision for Cuba's future during a speech he will deliver.

In a study of 11,644 middle-aged Swedish twins who were followed for 43 years, researchers compared the effects of an average of more than two drinks daily (\"heavy drinking\") to less than half a drink daily (\"light drinking\"). The study showed that: *Heavy drinkers had about a 34 percent higher risk of stroke compared to light drinkers. *Mid-life heavy drinkers (in their 50s and 60s) were likely to have a stroke five years earlier in life _ of genetic and early-life factors. *Heavy drinkers had increased stroke risk in their mid-life compared to well-known risk factors like high blood pressure and diabetes. *At around age 75, blood pressure and diabetes appeared to take over as one of the main influences on having a stroke. Past studies have shown that alcohol affects stroke risk, but this is the first study to pinpoint differences with age. \"We now have a clearer picture about these risk factors----how they change with age and how the influence of drinking alcohol shifts as we get older,\" said Pavla Kadlecova, M.Sc., a statistician at St. Anne's University Hospital's International Clinical Research Center in the Czech Republic. Researchers analyzed results from the Swedish Twin Registry of same-sex twins who answered questionnaires in 1967-1970. All twins were under age 60 at the start. By 2010, the Registry had provided 43 years of follow-up, including hospital discharge  and cause of death data. Researchers then sorted  the data based on strokes, high blood pressure, diabetes and other cardiovascular  incidents. Almost 30 percent of participants had a stroke. They were categorized(......) as light, moderate, heavy or non-drinkers based on the questionnaires. Researchers compared the risk from drinking and health risks like high blood pressure, diabetes and smoking. Among identical twin pairs, siblings  who had a stroke drank more than their siblings who hadn't had a stroke, suggesting that mid-life drinking raises stroke risks regardless of genetics and early lifestyle. The study is consistent  with the American Heart Association's recommended limit of two drinks a day for men and one for women. That's about 8 ounces of wine for a man and 4 ounces for a woman. Regular heavy drinking of any kind of alcohol can raise blood pressure and cause heart failure or irregular heartbeats over time, in addition to stroke and other risks. \"For mid-aged adults, avoiding more than two drinks a day could be a way to prevent stroke in later productive age ,\" Kadlecova said.

The following list is a good place to start. *In many countries, it is standard procedure to attach a photo or have your photo printed on your resume. Do not attach a photograph to your resume if you are sending it to the United States, though. *Educational requirements differ from country to country. In most cases of \"cross-border\" job hunting, just stating the title of your degree will not be enough.

Many people ride bicycles for recreation, whereas others use them as a means of transportation. The first bicycle was invented in Germany in 1818. Because it was made of wood, it wasn't very strong nor did it have pedals  .Riders moved it by pushing their feet against the ground. In 1839, Kirkpatrick Macmillan, a Scottish blacksmith, invented a much better bicycle. Macmillan's machine had iron-covered wheels to keep them from getting worn down. He also used foot-operated levers, similar to pedals, so his bicycle could be ridden at a quick pace. It didn't look much like the modem bicycle, though, because its back wheel was substantially larger than its front wheel. Although Macmillan's bicycles could be ridden easily, they were never produced in large numbers. In 1861, Frenchman Pierre Michaux and his brother Ernest invented a bicycle with an improved pedal mechanism. They called their bicycle a velocipede,but most people called it a \"bone shaker\" because of the effect of the wood and iron frame. Despite the impolite nickname, the velocipede was a hit. After a few years, the Michaux family was making hundreds of the machines annually, mostly for fun-seeking young people. Ten years later, James Starley , an English inventor, made several innovations that revolutionized bicycle design. He made the front wheel many times larger than the back wheel, put a gear on the pedals to make the bicycle more efficient,and lightened the wheels by using wire spokes. Although this bicycle was much lighter and less tiring to ride, it was still clumsy, extremely top-heavy,and ridden mostly for entertainment. It wasn't until 1874 that the first truly modern bicycle appeared on the scene. Invented by another Englishman, H. J. Lawson, the safety bicycle would look familiar to today's cyclists. The safety bicycle had equal-sized wheels, which made it easier to ride. Lawson also attached a chain to the pedals to drive the back wheel. By 1893,the safety bicycle had been further improved with air-filled rubber tires, a diamond-shaped frame, and easy braking.

{"answer": 2, "choices": ["her eyes and her kidneys were affected", "grandma became quite a different person", "Daniel had to be sent back to his father", "everything was thrown into confusion"], "question": "My grandson, Daniel, and I have always been very close. When Daniel's father remarried after a divorce, Daniel, who was eleven, and his little sister, Kristie, came to live with us. My husband and I were more than happy to have kids in the house again. Things were going along just fine until the diabetes   I've lived with most of my adult life started affecting my eyes, and then more seriously, my kidneys  . Then everything seemed to fall apart. Three times a week, I had to go to the hospital to be hooked up to a dialysis machine  . I was living, but I couldn't really call it a life -- it was an existence. I had no energy. I dragged myself through daily chores and slept as much as I could. My sense of humor seemed to disappear. Daniel, seventeen by then, was really affected by the change in me. He tried as hard as he could to make me laugh, to bring back the grandma who loved to clown around   with him. Even in my sorry state, Daniel could still bring a smile to my face. But things were not improving. After a year on dialysis, my condition was deteriorating   and the doctors felt that if I didn't receive a kidney transplant within six months, I would surely die. No one told Daniel this, but he knew -- he said all he had to do was look after me. To top it off, as my condition worsened, there was a chance that I would become too weak to have the transplant surgery at all, and then there would be nothing they could do for me. So we started the tense and desperate wait for a kidney. I was adamant   that I didn't want a kidney from anyone I knew. I would wait until an appropriate kidney became available, or I would literally die waiting. But Daniel had other plans. The time that he took me to my dialysis appointments, he did a little secret research on his own. Then he announced his intention to me. \"Grandma, I'm giving you one of my kidneys. I'm young and I'm healthy ...\" He paused. He could see I wasn't at all happy with his offer. He continued, almost in whisper, \"And most of all, I couldn't stand it if you weren't around.\" His face wore an expression of appeal mixed with determination. He can be as stubborn as a mule   once he decides on something -- but I've been told many times that I can out-stubborn any mule! We argued. I couldn't let him do it. We both knew that if he gave up his kidney, he would also give up his life's dream; to play football. It was all he ever talked about. And he was good, too. Daniel was co-captain and star defensive tackle   of his high school team; he expected to apply for a football scholarship and was looking forward to playing college football. He just loved the sport. \"How can I let you throw away the thing that means the most to you?\" I pleaded with him. \"Grandma,\" he said softly, \"compared to your life, football means nothing to me.\" After that, I couldn't argue anymore. So we agreed to see if he was a good donor   match, and then we'd discuss it further. When the tests came back, they showed Daniel was a perfect match. That was it. I knew I wasn't going to win that argument, so we scheduled the transplant. Both surgeries went smoothly. As soon as I came out of the anesthesia   , I could tell things were different. I felt great! The nurses in the intensive care unit had to keep telling me to lie back and be quiet -- I wasn't supposed to be that lively! I was afraid to go to sleep, for fear I would break the spell   and wake up the way I had been before. But the good feeling didn't go away, and I spent the evening joking and laughing with anyone who would listen. It was so wonderful to feel alive again. The next day they moved me out of ICU and onto the floor where Daniel was recuperating   three doors away. His grandfather helped him walk down to see me as soon as I was moved into my room. When we saw each other, we did not know what to say. Holding hands, we just sat there and looked at each other for a long time, overwhelmed by the deep feeling of love that connected us. Finally, he spoke, \"Was it worthwhile, grandma?\" I laughed a little ruefully  . \"It was for me! But was it for you?\" I asked him. He nodded and smiled at me. \"I've got my grandma back.\" And I have my life back. It still amazes me. Every morning, when I wake up, I thank God --and Daniel -- for this miracle.

{"answer": 1, "choices": ["People who live in an industrial city.", "People who would like to travel but cannot.", "Ambitious people.", "People who go on holidays abroad."], "question": "Everyone has an ambition to travel. But those who cannot do so themselves might find it interesting to work in a travel agency, arranging journeys for other people. Brian Lawtey does this, working in a small travel agency in an industrial city. Most of his work is concerned with holiday, both at home and abroad. Every autumn, the agency sends out hundreds of booklets full of attractive, color1ed photographs, describing the holidays that their customers will be able to have the next year. Soon, people begin to come into the office to book their holidays: perhaps a week's skiing in prefix = st1 /Austriain January, perhaps a cruise to the Caribbean in February, perhaps a seaside holiday inSpainin May, or a tour of Africa. Brian often has to advise people on what holidays will be suitable for them, and they always have a lot of questions. Last year, for example, a lady of eighty-two wanted to book for a mountaineering holiday in the Alps, and Brian had great difficulty in persuading her that it would not be suitable. In the end, she decided to go for a Mediterranean cruise instead.   Arranging journeys for people who have to travel abroad on business is often very complicated, but Brian enjoys this work. For example, last spring Mr. Perry,a director of chemical firm, went on a business trip, and Brian arranged it all for him.

According to a recent study, however, if you really think about it, something about that simple answer doesn't quite make sense. In fact, it turns out that sometimes it's having will power that really gets you into trouble. Think back to the time you took your very first sip   of beer. Disgusting, wasn't it? When my father gave me my first taste of beer as a teenager, I wondered why anyone would voluntarily drink it. And smoking? No one enjoys their first cigarette -- it tastes awful. So even though smoking, and drinking alcohol or coffee, can become temptation   you need will power to resist, they never, ever start out that way. Just getting past those first horrible experiences actually requires a lot of self-control. Ironically  , only those who can control themselves well, rather than give in to them, can ever come to someday develop a \"taste\" for Budweiser beer, Marlboro cigarettes, or dark-roasted Starbucks coffee. We do it for social acceptance. We force ourselves to consume alcohol, cigarettes, coffee and even illegal drugs, in order to seem experienced, grown-up, and cool.

We spoke Tuesday with Jonathan Links, an expert in radiation health sciences. He is a professor at the Johns Hopkins Bloomberg School of Public Health in Maryland. Professor Links says workers within the nuclear plant are the only people at risk of extremely high doses of radiation. JONATHAN LINKS: \"Of course, we don't know what doses they've received, but the only persons at risk of acute radiation effects are the workers.\" For other people, he says, there may be a long-term worry. People can get cancer from low doses of ionizing radiation, the kind released in a nuclear accident. Professor Links says scientists can use computers to quickly model where radioactive material has blown and settled. Then they measure how large an area is contaminated. He says if the situation is serious enough, officials could take steps like telling people not to eat locally grown food or drink the water. JONATHAN LINKS: \"But that would only be the case if there was a significant release and, because of wind direction, the radioactive material was blown over the area, and then settled out of the air into and onto water, plants, fruits and vegetables.\" The reactors at Fukushima are on the Pacific coast.

Earthquakes, heat waves, floods, volcanoes, super typhoons, landslides and droughts killed at least a quarter million people in 2010 - the deadliest year in more than a generation. More people were killed worldwide by natural disasters this year than have been killed in terrorism   attacks in the past 40 years combined. \"It just seemed like it was back-to-back and it came in waves,\" said Craig Fugate, who heads the US Federal Emergency Management Agency. It handled a record number of disasters in 2010. \"The term '100-year event' really lost its meaning this year.\" And we have ourselves to blame   most of the time, scientists and disaster experts say. Even though many disasters seem accidental, the hand of man made this a particularly deadly, costly, extreme and strange year for everything from wild weather to earthquakes. Poor construction   and development practices make earthquakes more deadly than they need be. More people live in poverty in vulnerable buildings in crowded cities. That means that when the ground shakes, the river breaches  , or the tropical cyclone   hits, more people die. The January earthquake that killed well more than 220,000 people in Haiti is a perfect example. Port-au-Prince has nearly three times as many people, many of them living in poverty , and more poorly built shanties   as it did 25 years ago. The same quake hit Port-au-Prince in 1985 instead of 2010, total deaths would have probably been in the 80,000 range, said Richard Olson, director of disaster risk reduction at Florida International University.www.ks5u.com Climate scientists say Earth's climate also is changing thanks to man-made global warming, bringing extreme weather, such as heat waves and flooding. The large amount of extreme weather is a clear sign of man-made global warming that climate scientists have long warned about. They calculate that the killer Russian heat wave - setting a national record of 111 degrees - would happen once every 100,000 years without global warming. Previous data show that 18 countries broke their records for the hottest day ever. White House science adviser John Holdren said we should get used to climate disasters or do something about global warming: \"The science is clear that we can expect more and more of these kinds of damaging events unless and until society's emissions   of heat-trapping gases and particles   are sharply reduced.\" Why did the writer give the example of the earthquake that happened in Haiti?", "subject": ""}
{"answer": 1, "choices": ["valuable", "natural", "unusual", "bearable"], "question": "Dear David, I'm glad you would like to share your feelings with me. It's hardly surprising that your feelings of not being \"grown up\" have come on strongly at this point in your life, just before you're about to become a father. You are asking: will I make a good father? How will I deal with? Should I have brought another little person into the world? Can I provide for it? Heeelp! I think nearly every sensitive about-to-be-parent must have these occasional feelings of self-doubt and inadequacy before the birth and it would be most unusual if you didn't share them. It's difficult, honestly, to feel grown-up unless you have something less grown-up to relate to. The boss with a hen-pecking wife may feel like a seven-year-old when he's at home. But as he walks through the office door, and knows he's going to be surrounded by staff looking to him for advice, he grows into a fully mature man. And I think it's a mistake to imagine that we all feel, as we age, a kind of progression of states, from the baby to the adult. Most people feel, on Tuesday, about three years old, and on a Wednesday, around 80. I remember feeling very grown-up at eight, a time when I was weighed down with responsibility. These days, much older, I can, in the company of people I feel at ease with, feel like a young girl.  There's a common remark that \"all men are little boys\", but it's not true. It's more true that men often behave like little boys. But nearly all people, at some moments in their lives, are able of great maturity. Once your baby arrives, you'll soon feel less childlike, or rather, less often. When your child tries to put its fingers into the electric plug, the adult in you will rise up to prevent it. You'll see you have very little in common with a needy child, particularly if it's looking to you for comfort and support. Comfort yourself, David, with two truths. One is that your friends laugh when they talk about this subject because they, like you, feel frightened.

Economists, who generally believe that supply tends to meet demand, have long thought about this question. Even in good times, i.e. not now, there are people who can't find work. And even in bad times, i.e. now, there are job openings. With over 14 million people out of work and looking for a job, you would think every available job would be filled. But that's not the case. Not now and not ever. On Monday, the Nobel Prize committee awarded the prize for economics to the three scholars who have done the most to explain this phenomenon. Two of the winners are Americans, Peter Diamond of MIT and Dale Mortensen of Northwestern.

You Who Came From The Star and The Heirs   have been subjects of hot online discussions throughout Asia. Besides, the book, The Miraculous Journey of Edward Tulane, read by the hero You Who Came From The Star was a hard-to-get item on Amazon for a while. The two TV programs have several common elements  :a tall, handsome, and rich hero who loves the heroine blindly and always protects her, and an equally handsome man madly in love with the same woman. Both programs describe the purity of love, which is expressed through a kiss or a warm hug. Perhaps that's the secret of their success; perhaps people still like Cinderella-type stories. The widening wealth gap is a matter of social concern both in South Korea and China, and the challenges that young people face in their hope for a better life might have caused many ordinary girls to dream of marrying rich, caring men. This is precisely what the popular South Korean TV drams describe. _  Many netizens even said at an earlier time that South Korean TV dramas had become popular because of their stereotyped   themes: traffic accidents, cancer and other incurable diseases.

They came there to take part in an unusual competition--one that seeks out and honors the World's Ugliest Dog. Now in its 26th year, the competition is one of the biggest attractions at the annual Sonoma County Fair. Among the leading competitors were Cupcake, who was adopted   from a local dog rescue center in January and Shorty, who would have been put to sleep if its owner, Jason, wasn't kind enough to pick it up. Also competing was 11-year-old veteran Grovie. Described by his owner as short and funny, the Chinese pug is a local resident who has taken part in this contest several times. Then there was 2002 \"World's Ugliest Dog\" and \"Ring of Champions\" winner, Rascal. The 7lbs naturally hairless dog with very few teeth comes from an impressive background  . His grandfather, Chi Chi, holds the Guinness World Record for winning the title \"World's Ugliest Dog\" seven times! But all these impressively \"ugly\" dogs had no chance against Peanut. The two-year-old dog was badly burnt in a fire which caused him to lose his lips, most of his body hair and eyelids. Besides winning the title, $1,500 USD in cash and a large trophy  , the first time winner also enjoyed an all-expenses-paid trip to New York City where he made scheduled appearances on the Today Show and the Jimmy Kimmel Show. The competition is a great way to honor these dogs, many of whom get their unusual looks because of human abuse  .

{"answer": 2, "choices": ["To show the French diet is fairly delicious.", "To illustrate the French have a healthy diet.", "To stress the importance of using fresh food ingredients.", "To prove the French diet makes people fat easily."], "question": "Today's modern life discourages people from taking time to prepare their own meals. Eating in the car and grabbing a quick bite in a restaurant are ever more popular ways of dining. It takes a little extra effort and time to cook your own food, but it's a worthwhile pursuit that can benefit your health, wallet and family. People across the country are waking up to the fact that the food offered by most fast food restaurants isn't particularly healthy. While these restaurants have made attempts lately to add healthier meals to their menus, it's still _ a dish cooked with fresh ingredients  and personal care. Nutritionists who study what is called \"the French paradox\"--- meaning the fact that French people have low obesity rates despite their diet containing lots of \"unhealthy\" ingredients such as butter---partially account for this circumstance by the fact that many French people use fresh ingredients. Taking time to eat at a leisurely pace also helps you get better nutrition and you are less likely to pack on the pounds. Even a quick meal will usually cost at least five dollars per person at a restaurant. Compare this to the amount of pasta, vegetables or meat available for the same money at your home, and it quickly becomes apparent that the cost of eating out adds up. Experimenting with new ingredients or foreign recipes will encourage children to try new foods and learn about dishes from around the world. Many couples also find that preparing a meal together can be a romantic experience equal to dinner in a classy, low-lit restaurant. Make sure to spend meal times talking and sharing events from the day and you may find it's a great way to get to know your family better. Why is \"the French paradox\" referred to in the passage?", "subject": ""}

Around Christmas last year, we were heading to Grandma's house. The drive was an hour long, so we had plenty of time to chat. We were waiting to get onto the freeway when my daughter Hayley noticed a homeless man, no sign in hand. \"Mom, is that man homeless?\" I told her I believed he was. We got onto the freeway and drove away. But the chatting had stopped. Hayley was quiet all the way there. We spent a few hours at Grandma's then packed up to head home. As we drove back, Hayley rustled  around in her seat, trying to reach something on the floor of the car. I asked her to sit still, worried her seatbelt would slip from the booster seat. She mumbled something and sat back. \"Mom, will the homeless man still be outside tonight?\" I told her I was not sure, maybe. It was a freezing night, and I started to think of the man now too, and how cold he must be. All of a sudden, as we got onto the freeway exit, Haley shrieked  : \"There he is! There he is!\" and started rolling down her window. \"Mom, I found these gloves and scarf back here. Can I give them to him? Can I?\" she asked. I pulled over to the edge of the road, and beckoned  the man to come over. Haley smiled at him and handed him her gift.
