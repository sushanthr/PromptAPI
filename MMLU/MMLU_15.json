The game can be played for free, but nearly all in-game activities require personal resources that you have available to use.Although there are various activities to keep you busy on Calypso, what most people do first is to find themselves a profession, such as hunting the fierce animals on Calypso, mining the precious minerals and making tools.Then they can think about buying their virtual house or paying a visit to a virtual nightclub or doing any of the other activities that make life bearable. Entropia has its very own economy   and its own currency, the PED (Project Entropia Dollars).Players move real world money into PED which they then use to pay for their life on Calypso.However, the virtual things inside Entropia do have a real value in the outside world, and careful business deals mean that players can actually make real money there.PED can be changed into dollars any time at a rate of 10PED to 1US$.

His real name was Samuel Langhorne Clemens and he was born on November 30th, 1835, in the village of Florida, Monroe County, Missouri. After his father's death in 1847, Twain was apprenticed  to a printer and wrote for his brother's newspaper. Later, Twain worked as a licensed Mississippi riverboat pilot, adopting his name from the call ('Mark twain!'--meaning by the mark of two fathoms) used when sounding river shallows. After the Civil War, Clemens brought an end to the steamboat traffic and moved to Virginia City. On February 3, 1863, 'Mark Twain' was born when he signed a humorous travel account with his new name. In 1864, Twain went to San Francisco to work as a reporter. He traveled in France and Italy and his experience were recorded in 1869 in the Innocents Abroad, which brought him wide popularity, and made fun at both American and European prejudices and manners.  In 1870 he married Olivia Langdon. Together they relocated to Harford a year later. Meanwhile, Twain continued to lecture in the United States and England. Between 1876 and 1884 he published several masterpieces, including Tom Sawyer, the Prince and the Pauper, Life on the Mississippi, and Huckleberry Finn. In the 1890s, Twain lost most of his earnings in financial speculations and in the downhill of his own publishing firm.

But whether he is or not, what is it that makes Michael Phelps so good? A good place to start might be his physique . Phelps has the perfect body shape for a swimmer: his arm span is longer than his height, he has very flexible joints, huge lungs, and his incredibly large feet (size 14 in the US, size 49 inChina) act like flippers in the water. To feed his huge swimmer's body, Phelps eats an astonishing 12,000 calories a day, six times the average for a man of his age.  He then owes it to a swimsuit which has been making waves in the world of swimming. Designed by NASA, the American space agency, the suit is made of a special material which is said to help athletes swim 2% faster. Michael Phelps should spare a thought for his mum, who first pushed him into swimming as a way of making friends, and who believed in him when one teacher said he would never be a success. Whatever the reason for his success, Phelps admits there was perhaps also a bit of luck involving in winning his eight medals. \"I guess eight is a lucky number for me, too, now.

{"answer": 2, "choices": ["Changing Bad Daily Habits", "Excusing Our Own Faults", "Being Merciful Toward Others", "Working Toward Self-improvement"], "question": "When was the last time you were late and expected someone to understand? How about the time you left your dishes on the table for someone else to clean up? Or perhaps you left the lid on the peanut butter jar loose, and the person after you opened the jar to find it dry and not fresh. Often, we are eager to ignore our own faults. But we have higher standards when it comes to our expectations of someone else who has the same expectations. We need to as equally understand the weaknesses of others and excuse them just as we excuse ourselves. Two of my strengths are punctuality  and organization. I like to meet deadlines when they are due and keep the space around my computer neat and orderly. But sometimes things happen, and I slip from being perfect. When this happens, I show myself mercy and lower the standard for myself. However, if someone else makes a mess around my computer, I might not show them as much mercy as I show myself. If it can happen to me, then I should be willing to realize that it can happen to someone else as well. I am not suggesting that we should not work on improving our faults, or that it should be right to be late or leave a mess behind us. Although we should always be working towards self-improvement, we shouldn't have a double standard that says we are excused from our own mistakes but we cannot excuse someone else. If we are not 100-percent perfect, we shouldn't expect others to be. Mercy shows an understanding heart. If we are blind to our own faults, we will not be very merciful towards others. Showing a little mercy goes a long way when life's little mistakes take place. _ , showing mercy towards someone's shortcomings could cause us to receive some in return.

{"answer": 2, "choices": ["tired", "alone", "anxious", "breathless"], "question": "In many countries, heart disease kills a lot of women and even more men. There are four major causes of this disease and these are smoking, poor or bad diet, a family history of heart disease and stressful work. Among these main wrong-doers, the most common cause is stress. What is stress and how do you feel when you are under stress? Imagine you live alone - you are lying in bed at night and, suddenly, you hear someone in the kitchen. Immediately your heart begins to beat very fast and you feel that you can hardly breathe. What you are feeling is not stress, but fear. However, your body changes in the same way when you feel stress. That means that if you feel anxious and worried during an important examination, your heart may beat very fast and you may feel breathless too. You are experiencing stress. Another common situation in which a person is likely to feel stress is to have to do something, for example, performing a boring duty, every day. Let us look at the case of Annie who was a nurse. She felt a lot of stress in her work and began to have very bad headaches at the end of the day. Each morning she woke up more tired than she was when she went to sleep. She did not want to go out in the evening with her friends and she felt unhappy all the time. Finally, she sat down and thought about her life. She saw a lot of illness and death in her work but that was not the reason why she was under stress. The real reason was that she felt unable to make a positive decision in her job - she had to do what the doctors and sisters told her. So, Annie went back to college for further study. When she graduated, she found a job where she was part of a team as before, but where she had responsibility in making decisions. Her working hours were longer and her work more difficult than when she was a nurse but she enjoyed it. She felt she was in control of her life and her work.

The experts found no true temperature declines over time. \"If you look at the data and sort of cherry-pick a microtrend within a bigger trend, that technique is particularly suspect,\" said John Grego, a professor of statistics at the University of South Carolina. Yet the idea that things are cooling has been repeated in opinion columns, a BBC news story posted on the Drudge Report and in a new book by the authors of the best-seller Freakonomics. Last week, a poll by the Pew Research Center found that only 57 percent of Americans now believe there is strong scientific evidence for global warming, down from 77 percent in 2006.

By cloning and testing this gene in about 21,000 fruit flies, Rockefeller University researchers say they have discovered an entirely new mechanism   by which sleep is controlled. By studying these flies, the researchers discovered that mutations  in the insomniac gene were associated with a great reduction in sleep. While a typical fruit fly slept for an average of 927 minutes a day, the mutant flies slept for just 317. They also slept for shorter periods of time, and slept and woke more frequently. \"The results showed a great loss of both the time that the flies' sleep lasted and their ability to remain asleep after they slept,\" says researcher Nicholas Stavropoulos. The researchers also examined the link between sleep and lifespan, finding that flies with mutations to the insomniac gene lived only about two-thirds as long as unchanged flies. But when the scientists removed insomniac only inneurons ---allowing it to remain in the rest of the flies' bodies---this difference disappeared; the resulting animals slept poorly but lived just as long. \"This suggests that reduced sleep can be 'uncoupled'  from reduced lifespan, supporting the idea that some interruptions of sleep do not affect overall health, at least as far as lifespan is concerned,\" Stavropoulos says. Although flies and humans would appear to have little in common when it comes to lifestyle, scientists say that the mechanisms of sleep and wakefulness are likely to be quite similar. \"Sleep is a fundamental behavior in all animals, and it is poorly understood from a scientific standpoint, says Stavropoulos.

Even so, most white-collar work still happens in an office. One reason is that, according to findings of a new survey   of office workers conducted by Wakefield Research for the IT company Citrix, most bosses are doubtful about remote working. Half of the workers say their boss doesn't accept it, and only 35 percent say it's tolerated. Skeptical bosses will likely have their doubts reinforced   by the same survey, which shows that 43 percent of workers say they've watched TV or a movie while \"working\" remotely, while 35 percent have done housework,and 28 percent have cooked dinner. It is true, however, that working at home makes people much more efficient  , because it allows workers to take care of annoying housework while still getting their jobs done. It's much faster, for example, to shop for groceries at a quarter to three than to stand in line during the after-work rush. The fact that such practices remain officially unaccepted reflects how far we haven't come as a society from the days when we expected every full-time worker to be supported by a full-time homemaker. More broadly the Wakefield survey suggests that employers may be missing a low-cost way to give workers something of value. Sixty-four percent of those survey participants who haven't worked remotely would rather give up some bonus in order to get even one day a week working from home. Under such circumstances, smart firms need to find ways to let their employees have enough ability to change or be changed easily to suit a different situation to manage their time efficiently.

The storyline is quite simple. The Smurfs are living happily in their mushroom houses in the middle of a forest.Then one day the evil wizard Gargamel discovers their village and sends them by magic to present-day New York City.

With proper training , supervision , protective equipment and techniques , and a proper emphasis on winning , sports can develop a healthy body and spirit and a life-long interest in being active and fit .

Hill said: \"I realized I wanted to find a more powerful purpose for being here on this planet.\" As soon as she recovered, Hill traveled to California. There she saw ancient redwood trees, which are the largest trees in the whole world. The wood from redwood trunks is very hard. So the Pacific Lumber Company cut down many of the huge redwoods to use for construction. There are not many forests of these trees left. Many environmental activists want to protect the remaining trees. The redwoods are very important to the environment. In 1997 Hill learned a group called Earth First was working to protect a particular group of trees. They decided to send someone up into a redwood tree, hoping this would stop the company from cutting the trees down. Julia Butterfly Hill volunteered. Hill lived in the tree for over two years without ever coming down. Her home was a 6-by-8-foot tree house, 180 feet up. It is always cold and wet in a redwood tree.

Sweetest Day was the idea of Herbert Birch Kingston, who worked for a company in Cleveland, Ohio.

Thus in 1922, he launched the first Sweetest Day to give out boxes of candy to mainly poor children.

The tradition was so enjoyed that people often looked beyond kindness to treating their own friends or family to treats on Sweetest Day.

Ever since people started farming, they have tried to crossbreed plants to make them stronger or better tasting. At one time, only related plants could be crossed with each other. But when GM techniques were developed in the 1970s, scientists were able to put a single gene from a living creature into an unrelated creature. This means they can make crops more productive and resistant to disease by adding genes from other species.They can also create food with special characteristics, such as \"golden rice\", which is enriched with vitamin A. But many people believe GM foods are a health risk. At the moment, the official argument is that GM foods \"are not likely to present risks for human health\". But there are still many questions to be answered as the foods are produced in different ways. Some experts believe the genetic material added to plants can transfer to humans and give damage to our bodies. Further harm could be caused by the genes from GM plants crossbreeding with naturally produced crops. People in China are also getting worried about GM foods. More than 70 percent of the country's soybean oil is produced from imported GM soybeans.

{"answer": 0, "choices": ["Her daughter's repeated complaints.", "Fatigue resulting from lack of sleep.", "The poorly managed state of her house.", "The high financial costs adding up."], "question": "Caught in the Web A few months ago, it wasn't unusual for 47-year-old Carla Toebe to spend 15 hours per day online. She'd wake up early, turn on her laptop and chat on Internet dating sites and instant-messaging programs - leaving her bed for only brief intervals. Her household bills piled up, along with the dishes and dirty laundry, but it took near-constant complaints from her four daughters before she realized she had a problem. \"I was starting to feel like my whole world was falling apart - kind of slipping into a depression,\" said Carla. \"I knew that if I didn't get off the dating sites, I'd just keep going,\" detaching   herself further from the outside world. Toebe's conclusion: She felt like she was \"addicted\" to the Internet. She's not alone. Concern about excessive Internet use isn't new. As far back as 1995, articles in medical journals and the establishment of a Pennsylvania treatment center for overusers generated interest in the subject. There's still no consensus on how much time online constitutes too much or whether addiction is possible. But as reliance on the Web grows, there are signs that the question is getting more serious attention: Last month, a study published in CNS Spectrums claimed to be the first large-scale look at excessive Internet use. The American Psychiatric Association may consider listing Internet addiction in the next edition of its diagnostic manual. And scores of online discussion boards have popped up on which people discuss negative experiences tied to too much time on the Web. \"There's no question that there're people who're seriously in trouble because they're overdoing their Internet involvement,\" said psychiatrist   Ivan Goldberg. Goldberg calls the problem a disorder rather than a true addiction. Jonathan Bishop, a researcher in Wales specializing in online communities, is more skeptical. \"The Internet is an environment,\" he said. \"You can't be addicted to the environment.\" Bishop describes the problem as simply a matter of priorities, which can be solved by encouraging people to prioritize other life goals and plans in place of time spent online. The new CNS Spectrums study was based on results of a nationwide telephone survey of more than 2,500 adults. Like the 2005 survey, this one was conducted by Stanford University researchers.About 6% of respondents reported that \"their relationships suffered because of excessive Internet use.\" About 9% attempted to conceal \"nonessential Internet use,\" and nearly 4% reported feeling \"preoccupied by the Internet when offline.\" About 8% said they used the Internet as a way to escape problems, and almost 14% reported they \"found it hard to stay away from the Internet for several days at a time.\" \"The Internet problem is still in its infancy,\" said Elias Aboujaoude, a Stanford professor.

The website for Orzack's center lists the following among the psychological symptoms of computer addiction: * Having a sense of well-being   or excitement while at the computer. * Longing for more and more time at the computer. * Neglect of family and friends. * Feeling empty, depressed or irritable when not at the computer. * Lying to employers and family about activities. * Inability to stop the activity. * Problems with school or job.

If it continues, Greenland itself could become much smaller during this century and global seas could rise as much as 3 feet. The rates of change that we're noticing are much higher than expected.

However, it's not known how quickly this coastal response of the Greenland ice sheet melting will have an effect on the vast inland ice. Greenland is the world's largest island, covering area more than three times the size of Texas. Some 81 percent of it is covered by ice, and there are many glaciers. Glaciers are like slow-moving rivers of ice. Where a glacier meets the sea, its weight keeps it firmly resting on the bottom. A glacier's front is the point where the water is deep enough that the glacier floats. Since the 1970s, the front of Helheim stayed in the same place. Then it began melting rapidly, moving back 4.5 miles from 2001 through this past summer. It has also grown thinner, from top to bottom, by more than 130 feet since 2001. And over these past years, its trip to the sea has sped up from about 70 feet per day to nearly 110. The melting is driven by a warmer climate. Temperatures in Greenland have risen more than five degrees Fahrenheit  in the last ten years. Since most of Greenland's ice is on land, seas will rise as the ice melts.

Chinese generosity is a real education for Americans like me, who would rather avoid social entanglements   and just hand over the money. But cash can't make up for the greatest gift - friendship. When an American saw some of my friends sitting on bamboo stools under the trees, sipping tea, he said, \"They must have nothing better to do.\" \"Actually,\" I said, \"they are professors, with plenty to do. But probably you're right in saying that, at this moment, they have nothing better to do. And neither do I.\" And I joined the group. We chatted about tea and Chinese cooking and how much my boys have grown since we arrived. One man said, \"They were pocket-sized when you came here. Now they're taller than you. How time flies.\" How life flies. And Chinese are smart enough to share what they know they cannot keep. They freely give of their time, never too busy to help a friend. And they are teaching me, slowly, to both give and receive. So the next time someone says, \"No charge. We're friends.\" I will thank them heartily. But if they show up later asking me to tutor them in English, I'll make sure they tutor my son in Chinese as well, because there's still no free lunch.

Finally, one of the kites succeeded in breaking loose. \"Free at last,\" it seemed to say. \"Free to fly with the wind.\" Yet freedom from control simply put it at the mercy of an unsympathetic gentle wind.

The weather's not often bad, and rain and snow have their charms. I've been cycling to work since the late 1990s. I started when the city was doing some construction in the subways and rerouting passengers, which would have lengthened my trip considerably. I tried riding my sister- in- law's bike to work one day and liked it, so I bought my own. Even though I hadn't biked since I was a child, I got back into it right away. I bike during all four seasons. In summer, I wear shorts and a T- shirt and carry a messenger bag over my shoulder for my lunch and anything else I need. Once at the office, I change into business- casual clothes. In winter, I wear layers and a thin hat under my helmet. A cold winter day can be the best time to be on a bicycle.

I'm sure that some people thinking my mode of transportation might be afraid of Midtown traffic. I'm no hero; I don't want to get hurt riding to work. It just takes time getting used to it. There's a risk, but all travel has risks. They're worth it to me. What made the author began to ride a bike to work?", "subject": ""}

She sent me inside the restaurant with my dad and my three siblings  .But she didn't come. Later, I found out she had gone home and emptied our cupboards into a few bags. Then, she brought that food over to the car and handed the bags to the family. I wasn't there when that part happened, but I can imagine the joy it brought to their faces. A few days later, when I actually found out about what she had done, I asked her why she helped those people. She told me that they were not lucky. I remember the face of that girl who had asked us for dollars; she was the same age as me, yet our lives were so different. Here I stood, dressed in almost new clothes, headed to a restaurant and then back home to the bedroom I shared with my younger sister. I remember thinking that the girl didn't have any food to eat and that she was heading back to a cold car shared with five other people. After painting this picture in my mind, I understood my mom. I will never forget what she did that night. And that night I also learned one of the best lessons she taught. It can be inferred from the passage that the writer will   _  .", "subject": ""}

A true friend is someone who stays with you for life.\" Experience teaches that he was right. Good friendships are just not easily formed. Why? One reason is that it is easy to move around in our society. Mr. Darrell Sifford, a news reporter for the Washington Daily, has been studying and talking about friendships for a number of years. He reports what one woman thought about the effect of ease of movement on friendship: \"I was nine, and we'd just moved from South Carolina to New Jersey, and I didn't know anybody. _ and she said to me, 'Amelia, I know you're feeling bad because you don't have any friends. But you can fix that. Just walk across the street -- I know there's a girl about your age over there -- and knock on the door and ask her to be your friend.'\" \"As a 9-year-old, I could do that. I knocked on the door and said, 'Hi, my name is Amelia, and I'd like for us to be friends.' And to my surprise, she said that she would like that too--and we became friends.\" She added that going about it directly always worked when she was a child. But as she left childhood, she found that the simple direct approach was more and more difficult for her to follow. So, as an adult, Amelia longed to have friends but her hands were tied when it came to doing anything about it. The problem, according to her, is that society teaches us in a number of ways that direct action is not an acceptable way of doing things. We need to be less direct so that our feelings will not be hurt if our offer of friendship is refused. Mr. Sifford goes on to describe his own ideas on the subject: \"To most of us, friendship is very important, but we need to have clear in our own minds the kinds of friendships we want. Are they to be very close or kept at arm's length? Do we want to share ourselves or do we want to walk on the surface?\" \"For some people, an ordinary friendship is enough -- and that's all right. But at some point we need to make sure that what we expect from the friendship is the same as what our friends expect from it. If one wants more from the friendship than the other, and if this is not talked about, one is likely eventually to feel that he's not being given enough attention. \"The sharing of close secrets, including our fears as well as our dark dreams, is the surest way to deepen friendships. But the process must be gone through slowly and continued only if there are signs of interest and our efforts are answered.\" What are some of the problems in forming friendships? According to Mr. Sifford, the biggest problem is to expect too much too soon. Deep relationships take time. Another \"big difficulty\" is to think one \"possesses\" the other and that he should spend all his time only with you. Similarly, friendships require action from both sides. In short, you must give as much as you take. Finally there is a question of developing friendship. Unless you spend enough time together, talking on the phone, writing letters, doing things together, friendships will gradually fade away. Why is it so difficult to form friendships? Perhaps it is possible, as Mr. Sifford states, that we simply do not stay in one place long enough for a true friendship to develop. However, we all agree that each of us should think carefully about the kind of friendships we want.

We tell ourselves our life will be better when our spouse   gets his/her act together, when we have a nicer car, when we can take a vacation, when we finally retire. The truth is that there is no better time to be happy than right now. If not, then when? Your life will always be full of challenges. It is better to admit as much and to decide to be happy in spite of it all. For the longest time, it seemed that life was about to start--real life. But there were always some obstacles along the way, an ordeal   to get through, some work to be finished, some time to be given, a bill to be paid. Then life would start. I finally realized that those obstacles were part of life. Little by little, that point of view also helped me see that there isn't any road to happiness. Happiness is the road. So, enjoy every moment. And keep in mind that   _  . So stop waiting for school to end, for a return to school, to lose ten pounds, to gain ten pounds, for work to begin, to get married, for Friday evening, for Sunday morning, waiting for a new car, for your mortgage  to be paid off, for spring, for summer, for fall, for winter, for the first or the fifteenth of the month, for your song to be played on the radio, to die, to be reborn... before deciding to be happy. Happiness is a voyage, not a destination. There is no better time to be happy than... NOW! Live and enjoy the moment. The writer thinks    _   is a real happiness", "subject": ""}

Doctors of our generation are not newcomers to this question. Going back to my internship days, I can remember many patients in pain, sometimes in coma , with late, hopeless cancer.

The best way to bring the problem into focus is to describe two patients whom I cared for. The first, formerly a nurse, had an automobile accident. A few days later her lungs seemed to fill up; her heart developed dangerous rhythm disturbances. So there she was: in coma, on a breathing machine, her heartbeat maintained with an electrical device. One day after rounds, my secretary said the husband and son of the patient wanted to see me. They told me their wife and mother was obviously going to die; she was a nurse and had told her family that she never wanted this kind of terrible death, being maintained by machines. I told them that while I respected their view, there was nothing deadly about her situation. The kidney  failure she had was just the kind for which the artificial kidney was most effective. While possibly a bit reassured, they were disappointed. Here was the head surgeon seemingly determined to keep everybody alive, no matter what. Within a few days the patient's pacemaker  could be removed and she awoke from her coma. About six months later, the door of my office opened and in walked a gloriously fit woman.

If there's a woman's trait  which is the same as men's aggressiveness, it's what social scientists refer to as the result of \"education\".

That question motivate a challenging new study of the brains of experienced players that has caused discussion and debate among soccer players, and some anxiety among those of us with soccer-playing children. For the study, researchers at the Albert Einstein College of Medicine in New York selected 34 adults,men and women. All of the volunteers had played soccer since childhood and now competed year-round in adult soccer leagues.

It is still the book that I turn to when I have physical unrest that requires deeper understanding. Louise Hay is the pioneer in looking at the connection between the physical unrest that we have in our body and the emotional connection. At the time that she wrote the book many people scoffed at this idea, but it is now widely accepted and millions of people refer to it on a daily basis. 2) , Don Miguel Ruiz: Maintaining a sense of reliability and faith is developed through understanding to The Four Agreements by Don Miguel Ruiz written in 1997. We are faced with rules and regulations; don't do this, don't do that, watch what you are doing, be kind, loyal, faithful etc. The four agreements represent a simple system of maintaining your own inner authority while practicing being a true person with other people. 3) , Richard Carlson and Joseph Bailey: This is a new one in my \"bedside collection\" and one that has made the biggest impact on me lately. Written in 1997, it is even more relevant today than it was when it was written. The idea of \"slowing down\" to get there faster was extremely hard for me to understand. As a human species we seem to enjoy moving fast and expecting quick results, especially from ourselves. I should be successful now, I should be slim now, get me to my destination now--in contrast to \"in the fullness of time\" when I am ready. 4) , Florence Scovel-Shinn: A classic book that was first published in 1925 and remains one of my favorite books of all time. Scovel-Shinn understood the power of our words to express either our deepest desires or our most horrible nightmares. So where does this leave you?

Just a few meters away,we have a small area for playing basketball and on most days of the week there are up to six young people who play there,including both my sons.My thoughts immediately turned to what could have happened if the broken glass in the window had gone unnoticed for much longer and then suddenly broke.Then my two sons and their friends would be likely to be seriously injured.The pain that could have been caused by the broken glass would never go away.

The whole nation had been hoping for a more successful outcome to the attempted rescue, updates of which were shown on TV news programmes throughout the day and night.  The five- meter long bottle-nosed whale, which probably weighted about four tones, was first spotted in the river on Friday. There had been reports that a pod of whales had swum into the Thames Estuary earlier in the week, which caused terror among naturalists, as this kind of whale only thrives in much deeper water. It was the first sighting of the endangered species in the Thames since records began nearly a century ago. There was no more news of the pod, which suggests that most of them turned back and swam out to sea. However, one whale clearly became separated from this group. Incredibly, the first person to raise the alarm was a man who saw the giant mammal from the train he was on when it crossed the river. Almost immediately, a rescue attempt was mounted and further attempts to move the whale began on Saturday morning. After unsuccessfully attempting to gently encourage it to swim downstream of its own accord towards the Thames Estuary and eventually the sea, rescuers decided to move it onto the barge . The rescue operation involved winching the whale onto an inflatable raft which had been placed on the barge. 3,000 onlookers watched as the whale was treated with extreme care by the rescuers and applauded when the transfer operation was complete. The barge then set off with the intention of freeing the whale in deeper water. Sadly, it began to convulse during the journey and died. Earlier in the day,  naturalist and TV presenter Terry Nuktins had warned that attempts to move the large mammal were misguided and that the proximity of the rescuers to the whale was potentially disastrous.

Scientists are now closing in on the ability to bring back extinct species. No, this doesn't mean the plot of Jurassic Park is going to become a reality. Researchers need DNA to bring back a species. DNA is the chemical that carries the structure for a living thing. Dinosaurs have been gone too long for any of their DNA to remain in fossils. But there's a very real chance that we will be able to bring back more recently extinct species. This could even include Ice Age animals like the woolly mammoth. In 2003, a team of Spanish and French scientists re-created the Pyrenean ibex, which had gone extinct three years earlier. The new animal didn't survive long, but scientific advances should improve the success rate.

{"answer": 1, "choices": ["Two.", "Three", "Four.", "Five."], "question": "It never occurred to Sun Yukun that the decision he made four years ago would have an impact on his career. When the 22-year-old entered college in 2009, he decided not to change his rural residence to a students' collective one. But when he finished college and was offered a job with a state-owned enterprise in Beijing, Sun was told that he couldn't accept the offer unless he had an urban hukou (household registration record). This time, he had no choice but to change his residence status. Transferring hukou to a university became optional in 2003, and many students are confronted with the dilemma of whether to do so or not. Professionals suggest they make the decision based on their current situation and future plans. 'I regret transferring my hukou' Wang Jinbi, 20, is an accounting major at Beijing Union University. Coming from Chifeng, Inner Mongolia autonomous region, she transferred her hukou when she enrolled at university. \"I didn't think it was a big deal,\" Wang says. \"Since I'm registering under an urban hukou, it doesn't matter whether it's in Beijing or Inner Mongolia, I thought.\" What Wang didn't expect, however, is that she would regret her decision later. \"After two years of study, I've figured out my future plans. I want to return to my hometown and make a living there,\" she says. That means Wang needs to transfer her hukou back again, which she worries will be a troublesome procedure. \"I have a friend who graduated last year. She spent a lot of time and energy transferring her hukou back to her hometown again due to complicated paperworks,\" says Wang. Guidelines for transferring hukou Wang's experience is not uncommon. Many students don't know what their decision means for their future. In order to help these students, Xie Yongqiang, from the Chengdu Municipal Bureau of Justice, posted a guideline for transferring hukou on a micro blog. According to Xie, students should firstly think about where they're going to stay. \"If you like the city where you're studying and are considering staying there after graduation, then you should transfer your hukou,\" he wrote. Students should also transfer their hukou if they intend to participate in an exchange program.

'I want to stay in Beijing' Sometimes, students abandon their rural hukou for the prospect of a better future. Tang Yanwei is one of them. The 23-year-old from Yantai, Shandong province, had a rural hukou but transferred it after enrolling at Beijing University of Civil Engineering and Architecture. Although there are a lot of preferential policies for rural residents, for Tang, an urban hukou in Beijing is attractive. \"I want to stay in Beijing, so a students' collective Beijing urban hukou is a promising start,\" he says. \"I'll do anything that could help me stay here.

{"answer": 0, "choices": ["How they manage to migrate successfully.", "Why they migrate to warmer places.", "When they start migrating each year.", "Whether some birds fly faster than others."], "question": "Many birds migrate. This means that every year they fly somewhere warm in the winter and then return to the place they came from in the spring. One mystery is how birds know how to travel such long distances without getting lost. Scientists have wondered for years whether they are born with the knowledge of where to go or whether they learn it after they are born. Now, researchers have found evidence that shows that one type of bird, at least, learns how to migrate. The bird is the whooping crane , a tall, white bird that lives in the United States. In the 1940s, the number of these birds decreased to fewer than 25 individuals, and many people feared that they would die out. Thanks to efforts to save them, they have now increased to about 600. However, the birds are not very good at taking care of their young. Because of this, eggs are brought to a site in Maryland. There, scientists from the Whooping Crane Eastern Partnership raise the baby birds. Later, the young birds are taken from Maryland to Wisconsin, where the scientists teach them how to fly. From there, they fly about 2,200 kilometers south to Florida to spend the winter. The first time, scientists lead the way in a small airplane. From the second year, though, the birds travel by themselves. For 14 years, the scientists have kept a careful record of every flight the birds have taken between Wisconsin and Florida. They have also recorded which birds fly together, the relationships between the birds, and the gender of each bird. When scientists analyzed the data, they were surprised by the results. These showed that each bird took a very different route. However, as they got older, they flew more and more directly between Wisconsin and Florida. This continued until they were five years old. This indicates that the birds gradually learned the best route to take. Moreover, when an older bird was in a group, the whole group flew more directly. This suggests that the older birds taught the younger ones a quicker route. Scientists say that this evidence marks a big step toward solving the mystery of bird migration.

While we get on well with a number of people, we are usually friends with only a very few. For example, the average among students is about 6 per person. In the beginning, it much depends on how people meet, and on good first impressions. As we get to know people, we consider things like age, race, looks, economic and social status, and intelligence. Although these factors are not of the greatest importance, it is more difficult to have a good relationship with people when there is a big difference in age and background. We pay attention to actual behavior, facial expression, and the way a person speaks. Friends will stand closer together and soft voices also express friendliness, and it is because they may give the wrong signals that shy people often have difficulty in making friends. A friendly look with the wrong facial expression can turn into an unfriendly stare, and nervousness may be wrongly understood as unfriendliness. Some relationships are a result of argument and discussion, but it is usual for close friends to have the same ideas and beliefs, the same opinions and interests -- they often talk about \"being on the same wavelength\". The more closely involved people become, the more they depend on one another. People want to do friends favors and hate to let them down. Equally, friends have to learn to make allowances for each other, to put up with annoying habits, and to accept differences in opinion. In contrast with marriage, there are no friendship ceremonies to strengthen the relationship between two people. But the mutual support and understanding that results from shared experiences and emotions does seem to create a close and lasting relationship, which can overcome differences in background, and break down barriers of age, class or race.

For centuries it kept the America from being discovered by the people of Europe. The Atlantic Ocean is only half as big as the pacific, but it is still very large. It is more than 4,000 miles (6,000 km) wide where Columbus crossed it. Even at its narrowest it is about 2,000 miles (3,200 km) wide. There is so much water in the Atlantic that it is hard to imagine how much there is. But suppose no more rain fell into and no more water was brought to it by rivers. It would take the ocean about 4,000 years to dry up. On the average the water is a little more than 2 miles (3.2 km) deep, but in some places it is much deeper. The deepest spot is near Puerto Rico. This \"deep\" measures 30,246 feet --- almost six miles (9.6 km). Several hundred miles eastward from Florida there is a part of the ocean called the Sargasso Sea. Here the water is quiet, for there is little wind. Today the Atlantic is a great highway. It is not, however, always a smooth and safe one. Storms sweep across it and pile up great waves. Icebergs float down from the Far North across the paths of ships. We now have such fast ways of travelling that this big ocean seems to have grown smaller. Columbus sailed for more than two months to cross it. A fast modern steamship can make the trip in less than four days. Airplanes fly from New York to London in only eight hours and from South America to Africa in four! Suppose it's February 27th, 2000. You take a steamship to cross the Atlantic to North America, when will you probably get there?", "subject": ""}

It started two years ago, when I hit my head and got a concussion  . The concussion didn't heal properly, and after 30 days I was left with symptoms like nonstop headaches, sickness, memory loss, mental fog  . My doctor told me that in order to heal my brain, I had to rest it. So I had to avoid everything that caused my symptoms. For me that meant no reading, no writing, no video games, no work or e-mail, no running, no alcohol, no caffeine. In other words -- and I think you see where this is going -- no reason to live. Of course it's meant to be funny, but to be honest, suicidal idea is quite common with traumatic   brain injuries. It happens to one in three, and it happened to me. My brain started telling me: \"Jane, you want to die.\" It said: \"You're never going to get better.\" It said: \"The pain will never end.\" And these voices became so persistent and so persuasive that I started to reasonably fear for my life, which is the time that I said to myself after 34 days -- and I will never forget this moment -- I said, I am either going to kill myself or I'm going to turn this into a game. Now, why a game? I knew from researching the psychology of games for more than a decade that when we play a game -- and this is in the scientific works -- we deal with tough challenges with more creativity, more determination, more optimism, and we're more likely to reach out to others for help. And I wanted to bring these gamer characters to my real-life challenge, so I created a role-playing recovery game called Jane the Concussion Killer. The game was that simple: adopt a secret identity, recruit   your allies  , battle the bad guys, activate the power-ups  . But even with a game so simple, within just a couple days of starting to play, that fog of depression and anxiety went away. It just vanished. It felt like a miracle. It wasn't a miracle cure for the headaches or the cognitive   symptoms. Those lasted for more than a year, and it was the hardest year of my life by far. But even when I still had the symptoms, even while I was still in pain, I stopped suffering. Now what happened next with the game surprised me. I put up some blog posts and videos online, explaining how to play. But not everybody has a concussion, obviously, not everyone wants to be \"the killer,\" so I renamed the game SuperBetter.

The sea is always present in Helsinki. When you take a walk over the great open space of the central square, you will hear seabirds screaming. When you take the tram ,suddenly and unexpectedly, you are faced with a calm, shining blue sea. You may notice that people in Helsinki do not rush about as in other cities. Instead ,they walk along the roads, politely letting other people by. An usual way to see Helsinki for the first time is to start out by the boats. You will walk by the elderly women selling fish and vegetables in the market square and find yourself in front of a beautiful park. You may enjoy a pleasant walk in the park for a few hours and then take the tram. Trams are the perfect way to get around in Helsinki. Watching the old houses, parks, theatres, churches, shops, restaurants and people in the streets, you may have a slightly sad film feeling to it. The pale summer nights are another wonder in the city. Following the waterfront of the city after sunset, you couldn't help stopping and listening to the sweet silence, interrupted only by the screaming seabirds and leaving fishing boats.

The information collected from 3,000 sites across 15 countries shows it may be caused by the loss   of grasslands covered with flowers.

He did not go to school for very long, but he managed to teach himself everything he needed to know. When he was about 20 years old, O. Henry went to Texas, where he tried different jobs. He first worked on a newspaper, and then had a job in a bank, when some money went missing from the bank O. Henry was believed to have stolen it. Because of that, he was sent to prison. During the three years in prison, he learned to write short stories. After he got out of prison, he went to New York and continued writing. He wrote mostly about New York and the life of the poor there. People liked his stories, because simple as the tales were, they would finish with a sudden change at the end, to the reader's surprise. Where did O. Henry get most material for his short stories?", "subject": ""}

New research shows long-term sleep loss cannot be cured that easily. Scientists researched the effects of short- and long-term sleep loss and found that those who suffer long-term sleep loss may function normally soon after waking up, but experience steadily slower reaction times as the day goes by, even if they had tried to catch up the previous night. The research has important safety significances in an increasingly busy society, not just for shift-workers but for the roughly one in six Americans who regularly get six hours or less of sleep a night. \"We know that staying awake 24 hours without sleep will affect your performance to do all sorts of things, and this effect equals to drinking too much when driving,\" said lead researcher Dr. Daniel Cohen of Boston's Brigham and Women's Hospital. But when those who suffer long-term sleep loss become all-nighters, \"the harm is increased ten times,\" Cohen said. The National Institutes of Health says adults need seven hours to nine hours of sleep for good health. Regularly getting too little sleep increases the risk of health problems, including memory impairment and a weakened immune system.

{"answer": 2, "choices": ["The reason why they are bullied.", "The place where they are first bullied.", "The age at which they are first bullied.", "The person who first bullies them."], "question": "The age at which kids first fall victim to bullying  could influence how strongly they are affected,suggests a new study. And,surprisingly,it is not the youngest kids who are hurt the most in the long term. Bullying can have long-lasting effects,but particularly when it begins in adolescence,the researchers say. People subjected to either verbal (  )or physical bullying are known to be at greater risk of developing depression,anxiety disorders or to behave violently. But not everyone reacts in this way. Children bullied for the first time before they hit adolescence seem to get over it, but those who are bullied for the first time later on in adolescence seem to become more aggressive or are more likely to turn to drink as a means of coping. These are the conclusions of psychologist Matthew Newman and colleagues from the University of Texas at Austin,US. The team gave questionnaires to nearly 1,500 college students regarding their experience of physical and psychological bullying before adolescence--before high school--and in late adolescence--at high school. They assessed mood and mental state,judging by signs of anxiety or depression,such as sleeplessness. The group was also questioned about how they would react to certain challenges,such as humiliation. People who were bullied all revealed slightly higher levels of stress.

Or they want to look like what their society generally considers beautiful. Some beauty care  products and soaps contain chemicals that make skin lighter. However, some of the chemicals are extremely dangerous. The chemicals in the products block and break down the natural barrier  to protect against sunlight. Then the skin can become thick and discolored. Usually the person will use more of the product in an effort to correct the problem, which just makes things even worse. Doctor Ly says some chemicals are so dangerous that they may lead to blackened fingernails, infections  and serious skin damage. And these are not the only problems. Experts say some people who change their skin color suffer emotional damage. They feel regretful and sad. They feel that instead of risking their health, they should have learned to live and accept their skin color as it was. What would be the best title for the passage?", "subject": ""}

However, the participants with the highest accuracy were those who rated themselves moderately accurate -- those highly confident of their judgment were less successful.

Jeremy Biesanz, who led a team of researchers from the University of British Columbia, said: \"Many important decisions are made after very brief encounters -- which employee to hire, which person to date, which student to accept\". Although our first impressions are generally accurate, it is necessary for us to recognize where they may be not good enough. The researchers arranged for two groups of more than 100 people to meet in a meeting. Much like speed-dating, the volunteers spoke to everyone in their group for three minutes each. At the end of each three-minute chat, they were asked to rate each other's personalities, and how well they thought their impressions \"would  _ someone who knows this person very well\". To find out what the person was \"really\" like, the scientists had his friends and family fill out his personality reports. Generally speaking, the more confident the volunteers felt in accurately rating another's personality, the closer their ratings were to those of the other person's friends and family, the researchers said. However, the participants with the highest accuracy were those who rated themselves moderately accurate -- those highly confident of their judgment were less successful. The scientists concluded that, although we know people are different from each other, a good judge of character knows that in many ways people are mostly alike. For example, almost everyone would prefer being kind to being unfriendly. Therefore, while first impressions can be generally accurate, they are not conclusive in working out whether somebody really is \"better\" than someone else.

His parents got divorced. He spent most of his childhood with his grandmother inLawrence,Kansas. She told him stories about their family and their fight to end slavery. Her storytelling filled him with pride in himself and his race. He first began to write poetry when he was living with her. In 1919, he moved to Cleveland,Ohio, to stay with his mother. He attended Central High School inCleveland. Langston was named Class Poet one year. He published his first short stories while still in high school. Langston Hughes struggled with a feeling of loneliness caused by his parents' divorce. He developed a love for reading books as a way to deal with the lack of time his parents spent with him. His love for reading grew into a desire to write. He wanted to reproduce the powerful effect other writers, like Walt Whitman, had made upon him. After graduating from high school in 1920, Langston moved to Mexico Cityto live with his father for one year. His father did not offer much warmth to him. Yet, Langston turned the pain caused by his family problems into one of his most famous poems,\" The Negro Speaks of Rivers.\" In this poem, he speaks of the strength and pride of black people in ancient African civilizations and inAmerica. Langston arrived in New Yorkat 19. Later, he left school, broke with his father, and began traveling. Traveling was a lifelong love that would take him throughout the world before he died. In 1922, Hughes took a job on a ship and sailed to Africa. He wrote poems and short stories during his travels. His experiences while traveling greatly influenced his work.

Some parents named their children based on family, cultural or religious traditions. Girls are often named after a family member but rarely their mothers.

This is shown in the fact that the most popular baby names are not as popular as they used to be. Researchers at San Diego State University in California did a study. They found that thirty-two percent of boys received one of the ten most popular names in 1955. The same was true for twenty-two percent of girls.

However, a recent study has shown that these slightly fat birds not only fly nonstop for long periods of time during their annual migration, but do so at record speeds. The brown migratory birds that are about the size of a pigeon spend their summers in Eastern Europe and winters in Central Africa, a distance of about 2,800 to 4,000 miles. In May 2009, a team of researchers led by Dr. Raymond Klaasen from Sweden's Lund University fitted ten Great Snipes with tiny geo-locating devices that allow scientists to figure out when and where the birds travel, and let them loose. The following year they found three of the birds and took back the devices. What they discovered was quite  _ . All three birds had flown nonstop to Central Africa in August of 2009-one had flown 4,225 miles in just 3.5 days.

I've found that it can make even the dullest jobs enjoyable and help clear mental blocks to creativity. I first noticed the good effects of music while playing video games. It was a few days before Christmas in 2005 and I was playing online video games. My parents had just given me a new MP3,so I decided to listen to music through the headphones while I played. After a few minutes I noticed a great change in my style of play. I was playing more naturally. The music relaxed me,and,to a certain extent,distracted me from the game,allowing my subconscious talent to come through. The music also helped me block out the outside world. With those headphones on I was like a machine,moving from one task to the next without unnecessary thoughts or actions. Music can also have a great effect on mood. If I'm in a bad mood at work,I'll listen to some of Bob Marley's and get down to business. It always takes my mind off what I'm doing and makes me a happier person. The same is true for classic rock.

While there's no doubt that school is important, a number of recent studies reminds us that parents are even more so. A study published earlier this month by researchers at North Carolina State University, for example, finds that parental involvement -- checking homework, attending school meetings and events, discussing school activities at home -- has a more powerful influence on students' academic performance than anything about the school the students attend. Another study, published in the Review of Economics and Statistics, reports that the effort put forth by parents (reading stories aloud, meeting with teachers) has a bigger impact on their children's educational achievement than the effort devoted by either teachers or the students themselves. And a third study concludes that schools would have to increase their spending by more than $1,000 per pupil in order to achieve the same results that are gained with parental involvement.

I'm not one of them. After a night without enough sleep, I feel bad-tempered. I have trouble remembering things. And all I want to do is go to bed. How do you feel after you've stayed up late to finish schoolwork or the day after an overnight party? Scientists now say that your answers to these questions may depend on your genes.  New research suggests that a gene called \"period 3\" influences how well you function without sleep. The \"period 3\" gene comes in two forms: short and long. Everyone has two copies of the gene. So, you may have two longs, two shorts, or one of each. Your particular combination depends on what your parents passed on to you. Scientists from the University of Surrey in England studied 24 people who had either two short or two long copies of \"period 3\". Study participants   had to stay awake for 40 hours straight. Then, they took tests that measured how quickly they pushed a button when numbers flashed   on a screen and how well they could remember lists of numbers. Results showed that the people with the short form of \"period 3\" performed much better on these tests than the people with the long form did. In both groups, people performed worst in the early morning.  After the first round of experiments, participants were finally allowed to sleep. People in the group that performed well on the tests (those with the short form of \"period 3\") took about 18 minutes to nod off. While people with the long \"period 3\" gene fell asleep in just 8 minutes. They also spent more time on deep sleep.

How do you feel after you've stayed up late to finish schoolwork or the day after an overnight party? Scientists now say that your answers to these questions may depend on your genes.  New research suggests that a gene called \"period 3\" influences how well you function without sleep. The \"period 3\" gene comes in two forms: short and long. Everyone has two copies of the gene. So, you may have two longs, two shorts, or one of each. Your particular combination depends on what your parents passed on to you. Scientists from the University of Surrey in England studied 24 people who had either two short or two long copies of \"period 3\". Study participants   had to stay awake for 40 hours straight. Then, they took tests that measured how quickly they pushed a button when numbers flashed   on a screen and how well they could remember lists of numbers.

Children and teens, like adults, need a regular sleep and wake timetable, even on weekends. Sleep should follow a relaxing bedtime plan. The bedroom should be cool, dark and quiet. Getting a good night's rest may become more difficult as they grow older because of more responsibilities   and activities, the influence of TV, computers and so on. However, sleep is still an important part of teens' health and overall quality of life. So, how do teens measure how much sleep they need? If a teen has trouble staying awake during school, they probably are not getting enough quality sleep.  Most sleep problems are treatable.

Researchers in the northern city of Sendai said that Japan's population of children aged up to 14, which now stands at 16.6 million, was falling at the rate of one child per 100 seconds. It would lead to a terrible result that there would be no children left in Japan in 1,000 years. \"If the rate keeps falling at that rate in our country, there will only be one child who is able to enjoy the following Children's Day left on May 5th, 3011,\" said Hiroshi Yoshida, a professor at Toholu University. \"But 100 seconds later, a national disaster that there are no children left in Japan will happen,\" he added, \"The nation's people will disappear for the birth rate has fallen to the level that every woman has no more than two children, which started in 1975.\" Yoshida said they created the population clock to make Japanese people pay close attention to that problem for their nation's future.

Emissions rose 5.9 percent in 2010, according to an analysis released on Sunday by the Global Carbon Project. Scientists said the increase was almost certainly the largest absolute jump in any year since the Industrial Revolution. The increase solidified a trend of ever-rising emissions that will make it difficult, if not impossible, to stop severe climate change in coming decades. The burning of coal represented more than half of the growth in emissions, the analysis found. In the United States, emissions dropped by a remarkable 7 percent in the year of 2009, but rose by over 4 percent in 2010, the new analysis shows. \"Each year, emissions go up, and there's another year of negotiations, another year of indecision,\" said Glen P.

But their increasingly urgent pleas that society find a way to limit emissions have met sharp political resistance in many countries because doing so would involve higher energy costs. The new figures show a continuation of a trend in which developing countries have surpassed   the wealthy countries in their overall greenhouse emissions. In 2010, the burning of fossil fuels and the production of cement   sent more than nine billion tons of carbon into the atmosphere, the new analysis found, with 57 percent of that coming from developing countries. On the surface, the figures of recent years suggest that wealthy countries have made headway in stabilizing their emissions. But Dr. Peters pointed out that, in a sense, the rich countries have simply exported some of them. The fast rise in developing countries has been caused to a large extent by the growth of energy-intensive manufacturing industries that make goods that rich countries import. \"All that has changed is the location in which the emissions are being produced,\" Dr. Peters said.

A shame, then, that solar power is still quite expensive. Eight19, a British company by Cambridge University, has, however, invented a novel way to _ this. In return for a deposit of around $10 it is supplying poor Kenyan families with a solar cell able to generate 2.5 watts of electricity, a battery that can deliver a three amp  current to store this electricity, and a lamp whose bulb is a light-emitting diode . The firm thinks that this system, once the battery is fully charged, is enough to light two small rooms and to power a mobile-phone charger for seven hours. Then, next day, it can be put outside and charged back up again. The trick is that, to be able to use the electricity, the system's keeper must buy a scratch card--for as little as a dollar--on which is printed a reference number. The keeper sends this reference, plus the serial number of the household solar unit, by SMS to Eight19. The company's server will respond automatically with an access code to the unit. Users may consider that they are paying an hourly rate for their electricity. In fact, they are paying off the cost of the unit. After buying around $80 worth of scratch cards--which Eight19 expects would take the average family around 18 months--the user will own it. He will then have the option of continuing to use it for nothing, or of trading it in for a bigger one, perhaps driven by a 10-watt solar cell. In that case, he would go then through the same process again, paying off the additional cost of the upgraded kit at a slightly higher rate. Users would therefore increase their electricity supply steadily and affordably. According to Eight19's figures, this looks like a good deal for customers. The firm believes the average energy-starved Kenyan spends around $10 a month on oil--enough to fuel a couple of smoky lamps--plus $2 on charging his mobile phone in the market-place.

He will then have the option of continuing to use it for nothing, or of trading it in for a bigger one, perhaps driven by a 10-watt solar cell. In that case, he would go then through the same process again, paying off the additional cost of the upgraded kit at a slightly higher rate. Users would therefore increase their electricity supply steadily and affordably. According to Eight19's figures, this looks like a good deal for customers. The firm believes the average energy-starved Kenyan spends around $10 a month on oil--enough to fuel a couple of smoky lamps--plus $2 on charging his mobile phone in the market-place. Regular users of one of Eight19's basic solar units will spend around half that, before owning it completely. Meanwhile, as the cost of solar technology falls, it should get even cheaper.

A shame, then, that solar power is still quite expensive. Eight19, a British company by Cambridge University, has, however, invented a novel way to _ this. In return for a deposit of around $10 it is supplying poor Kenyan families with a solar cell able to generate 2.5 watts of electricity, a battery that can deliver a three amp  current to store this electricity, and a lamp whose bulb is a light-emitting diode . The firm thinks that this system, once the battery is fully charged, is enough to light two small rooms and to power a mobile-phone charger for seven hours. Then, next day, it can be put outside and charged back up again. The trick is that, to be able to use the electricity, the system's keeper must buy a scratch card--for as little as a dollar--on which is printed a reference number. The keeper sends this reference, plus the serial number of the household solar unit, by SMS to Eight19. The company's server will respond automatically with an access code to the unit.

By helping the kids read or do math, I am not only teaching important skills but also helping them feel like any other kid. There are many wrong ideas about autism. The kids I work with can think and feel. They need help only in certain areas. Of course, each kid is special. For example, some kids like to draw, and others like to sing. At the school, the kids learn through about 20 activities. These activities can help them learn skills they will need later in life. The very first day I volunteered, a boy came up to me, put his hand on my shoulder, and said \"Hello\". From then on, I knew I could make a difference. Another boy loved to have me read books that can help him learn to read. Sometimes he could be encouraged to read a few words or sentences. Finally, one day during reading practice, he read nearly 220 words himself! Summer school is also a time for fun, Last summer, bagpipe players came to perform. Most of us had our hands over our ears because they were so loud. When they asked for a volunteer from the audience, one girl raised her hand as high as she could, got up on stage, and even tried the bagpipes in front of everyone. Through these experiences, I realize that the challenges these kids face do not stop them from doing many amazing things. I'm teaching them, but they are teaching me more.

{"answer": 3, "choices": ["how to drive safely on the road", "different forms of seat belts", "the history of seat belt development", "the importance of seat belt use"], "question": "Many countries have passed safety laws that require seat belts in vehicles. A modern three-point seat belt, also called a safety belt, is a harness to prevent the driver or a passenger from flying forward and hitting hard against the interior of a vehicle during a collision. A modern seat belt will help to position you properly to gain maximum benefit from your car's airbags that will inflate during a collision. Using a seat belt also prevents you from being ejected   from a car into the path of oncoming traffic. Research shows that when you wear a modern seat belt, you reduce the risk of death or serious injury by 70% or more during an auto accident. Seat belts have existed in different forms since the early days of automobiles, and they have changed from a single lap belt to the three-point seat belt we use today. In 1911 the first airplane seat belt was installed. Then, in the 1920's they were used in racecars. By the 1930s, a group of American physicians created lap belts for their own vehicles and urged vehicle manufacturers to provide seat belts on all vehicles. Dr. C. Hunter Shelden made a major contribution to our safety with his article in the November 5, 1955 Journal of the American Medical Association (JAMA). He strongly encouraged the manufacture and use of door locks, airbags, and retractable  seat belts, like the ones we use today. The modern three-point seat belt, including a lap belt and a shoulder belt, was introduced as standard equipment on Volvo cars in 1959. In 1970, the state of Victoria in Australia made the wearing of a seat belt compulsory for every car driver and front-seat passenger. Today many countries have also mandated  the use of five-point safety harnesses for carefully designed child safety seats that can protect a child during a serious car accident. An airbag is a Supplemental Restraint System, or SRS, and consists of a rapidly inflatable restraint cushion that works together with a seat belt to protect you during a collision. Modern cars often contain several airbags in various locations. Since airbags can only inflate once and will quickly deflate after the initial impact, they will not provide any protection for you during a secondary collision. The inflation of airbag can protect or hurt you. The risk zone for a driver's airbag is the first 8 centimeters from its pre-inflation location. While driving, you should remain about 25 centimeters from the airbag in the center of the wheel. As a driver, wear your seat belt and make sure children correctly use their seat belts. Failure to wear a seat belt properly means the airbags in your car might injure or even kill you during an accident. An essential part of your safe driving skills is the habit of making sure that you and each of your passengers are always properly positioned and wearing a seat belt.

Zoo officials say they are concerned about animals.How ever, most zoos remain \"collections\" of interesting \"things\" rather than protective habitats  .Zoos teach people that it is acceptable to keep animals bored, lonely, and far from their natural bones. Zoos claim   to educate people and save endangered species , but visitors leave zoos without having learned anything meaningful about the animals' natural behavior, intelligence, or beauty.Zoos keep animals in small spaces or cages, and most signs only mention the species' name, diet, and natural range .The animals' normal behavior is seldom noticed because zoos don't usually take care of the animals' natural needs. The animals are kept together in small spaces, with no privacy and little opportunity for mental and physical exercise.These results in unusual and self-destructive behavior called zoophobia.A worldwide study of zoos found that zoophobia is common among animals kept in small spaces or cages.Another study showed that elephants spend 22 percent of their time making repeated head movements or biting cage bars, and bears spend 30 percent of their time walking back and forth, a sign of unhappiness and pain. Furthermore, most animals in zoos are not endangered.Captive breeding of endangered big cats, Asian elephants, and other species has not resulted in their being sent back to the wild.Zoos talk a lot about their captive breeding programs because they do not want people to worry about a species dying out.In fact, baby animals also attract a lot of paying customers.Haven't we seen enough competitions to name baby animals? Actually, we will save endangered species only if we save their habitats and put an end to the reasons people kill them.Instead of supporting zoos, we should support groups that work to protect animals' natural habitats.

Women continue to earn less, on average, for the same performance. Research has shown that both conscious  and subconscious biases   contribute to this problem. But we've discovered another source of inequality: Women often don't get what they want and deserve because they don't ask for it. In three separate studies, we found that men are more likely than women to negotiate for what they want. The first study found that the starting salaries of male MBAs who had recently graduated from Carnegie Mellon were 7.6%, or almost $4,000, higher on average than those of female MBAs from the same program. That's because most of the women had simply accepted the employer's salary offer; in fact, only 7% had attempted to negotiate. But 57% of their male counterparts--or eight times as many men as women--had asked for more. Another study tested this gender difference in the lab. Subjects were told that they would be observed playing a word game and that they would be paid between $3 and $10 for playing. After each subject completed the task, an experimenter thanked the participant and said, \"Here's $3. Is $3 OK?\" For the men, it was not OK, and they said so. Their requests for more money are nine times as many as the women's. The largest of the three studies surveyed several hundred people over the Internet, asking them about the most recent negotiations they'd attempted or started and when they expected to negotiate next. The study showed that men place themselves in negotiation situations much more often than women do. There are several reasons accounting for the phenomenon. First, women often are taught from an early age not to promote their own interests and to focus instead on the needs of others. The messages girls receive--from parents, teachers, other children, the media, and society in general--can be so powerful that when they grow up they may not realize that they've made this behavior part of them, or they may realize it but not understand how it affects their willingness to negotiate.

{"answer": 0, "choices": ["knowingfactsbeyondthestatement", "lookingformoreevidencesforthestatement", "findingoutadifferentmeaningfromthestatement", "addingsomefactstothestatement"], "question": "The art of reading fiction is largely a matter of inferring meanings. To infer means to understand facts which are not directly stated---only suggested. Inference is one of the commonest ways of knowing things: a child holds his knee and cries; this action implies his feeling; an observer infers that the child is hurt. To infer accurately in everyday life requires caution in observing; to infer skillfully in fiction requires caution in reading; both require disciplined imagination. The short-story reader can expect to find certain basic elements in any story. For example, all stories involve a person or persons, in a particular setting, faced with a demand for a response. The response called for may be a physical action, such as defeating an adversary  or escaping from a danger; or it may be a mental action, such as adjusting to others or within oneself. In either case, the short story is a description in two ways: first, it shows the motives for a given human action; second, it makes a point about the general human situation. Such descriptions, however, rather than being stated directly, usually are implied by the elements of the story. When the reader of a story understands all the facts and their interrelationships, he is ready to infer the significance of the story as a whole---its comment on the human situation. This comment, or theme, is the seed from which the story grew. It is also the idea by which all the separate elements of the story are governed, while these in turn further shape and modify the theme.

To infer means to understand facts which are not directly stated---only suggested. Inference is one of the commonest ways of knowing things: a child holds his knee and cries; this action implies his feeling; an observer infers that the child is hurt. To infer accurately in everyday life requires caution in observing; to infer skillfully in fiction requires caution in reading; both require disciplined imagination. The short-story reader can expect to find certain basic elements in any story. For example, all stories involve a person or persons, in a particular setting, faced with a demand for a response. The response called for may be a physical action, such as defeating an adversary  or escaping from a danger; or it may be a mental action, such as adjusting to others or within oneself. In either case, the short story is a description in two ways: first, it shows the motives for a given human action; second, it makes a point about the general human situation. Such descriptions, however, rather than being stated directly, usually are implied by the elements of the story. When the reader of a story understands all the facts and their interrelationships, he is ready to infer the significance of the story as a whole---its comment on the human situation. This comment, or theme, is the seed from which the story grew. It is also the idea by which all the separate elements of the story are governed, while these in turn further shape and modify the theme.

A store supervisor led Wang to an office, accused her of theft and had her sign a form and pose for photos. Wang and her husband returned to the store the next day with the local media to demand an explanation. Carrefour China then apologized for the incident on its Sina micro blog, saying the managers and staff members involved have visited Wang's home and apologized. The company also sent three apology letters to Wang in the following three days. Eric Legros, president of Carrefour China, said,\"We made a mistake and we apologized four times. Four times, you know. And Carrefour will not do anything more about it.\" Wen Jun said the supermarket's management came with risks. For instance, Wen said the company would offer employees money if they caught a thief in the store. \"I hope this case will be a warning for the staff who want to get money by such an immoral   method,\" Wen said.

{"answer": 3, "choices": ["Amazing.", "Troublesome.", "Adventurous.", "Worthwhile."], "question": "\"The really big concern over the last decade,\" according to Dr. David Whitehead, \"is the relative loss of opportunities for children to engage in child-led play.\" That's true. One of the exhausting aspects of modern parenting is that everything, even doing nothing, has to be purposeful. Now that \"parenting\" has become a verb -- a state of doing, rather than simply being -- it can fed unnatural to leave your children to their own devices. Yet it creates spaces in which good things can happen. The psychology lecturer is responding to a survey showing that 80 percent of parents of small children feel under pressure to fill their days with \"structured\" activities. This, says Dr. Whitehead, is a mistake. Leaving your children to play on their own or with their peers enables them to develop \"self-regulation abilities\", which in turn leads to better academic achievement. One afternoon last autumn, sitting on a bench doing no parenting at all, I suddenly felt I was getting the hang of it. That afternoon, my sister and I took our children to the park. We had lots to talk about, so we sat down on a bench and drove the children away. After briefly complaining, the cousins wandered off and started jumping into puddles  . They jumped and jumped, and then one of them kicked some muddy water at the others. My sister and I, deep in conversation, didn't notice this. So my nephew became more adventurous. He scooped up a handful of mud and threw it on my son's head. My son caught his breath happily, wiped the mud out of his eyes, and threw one back. My nephew, who has a talent for naming things, puffed out his tiny chest and roared: \"Let's play Muddikins!\" The rules of Muddikins are simple.

But can other animals do the same? Elephants can! They can use their sense of vision and smell to tell the difference between people who pose a threat and those who do not. In Kenya, researchers found that elephants react differently to clothing worn by men of the Maasai and Kamba ethnic groups. Young Maasai men spear animals and thus pose a threat to elephants; Kamba men are mainly farmers and are not a danger to elephants. In an experiment conducted by animal scientists, elephants were first presented with clean clothing or clothing that had been worn for five days by either a Maasai or a Kamba man. When the elephants detected the smell of clothing worn by a Maasai man, they moved away from the smell faster and took longer to relax than when they detected the smells of either clothing worn by Kamba men or clothing that had not been worn at all. Clothing color also plays a role, though in a different way. In the same study, when the elephants saw red clothing not worn before, they reacted angrily, as red is typically worn by Maasai men. Rather than running away as they did with the smell, the elephants acted aggressively toward the red clothing. The researchers believe that the elephants' emotional reactions are due to their different interpretations of the smells and the sights. Smelling a potential danger means that a threat is nearby and the best thing to do is run away and hide. Seeing a potential threat without its smell means that risk is low. Therefore, instead of showing fear and running away, the elephants express their anger and become aggressive.

The easiest way is to check the \"expiration date  \" printed on the wrapper. If that date has already passed, you're likely to throw the candy away. But is that really necessary? According to a new report from the US Natural Resources Defense Council (NRDC), tons of food is wasted each year, largely because people don't fully understand what expiration dates, or \"use-by dates\", actually mean. Food dating was introduced in 1970s because customers wanted more information about the things that they were eating. When they first showed up, use-by dates were only supposed to indicate freshness because producers wanted their products to be tasted in their best conditions. But the truth is that these dates aren't related to the risk of food poisoning or food-born illness, according to Time News. However, most customers misinterpreted use-by dates and related them to the safety of the food, and they still largely do now. Eggs, for example, can still be eaten three to five weeks after purchase even though the use-by date is much earlier.

In fact, Niagara Falls is often fondly called the Honeymoon Capital of the World. This title, however, did not happen overnight. There are various reasons that explain why so many people choose to get married surrounded by a waterfall backdrop. These reasons often include the wonderful natural setting, its unique history, and the inclusion of various activities and attractions that please newlyweds. The Niagara Falls is the waterfalls and twin cities of the same name located on the Niagara River. The waterfalls are situated in the international border between the United States and Canada and are part of both countries. The United States part of the waterfall is in New York state, while the Canadian section is part of Ontario. Both waterfalls are further divided into two major sections: the American Falls, located on the American side, and the Horseshoe Falls, which lies mostly on the Canadian side. A number of tourists who have watched the rush of water falling down Niagara Falls have described the view using many terms, including magical, magnificent, and breathtaking. For many recently married couples, visiting the Canadian side of Niagara Falls is generally more popular, as it provides a better view of the rushing water of both waterfalls. Both sides, however, function as destination wedding sites and offer engaged couples the opportunity to exchange their vows  at various churches and gardens located within the area. Some couples, however, may prefer to get married on the Canadian side to receive a honeymoon certificate signed by the city's mayor.  Another reason why couples state that they choose to celebrate their weddings at Niagara Falls is the sense of history and nostalgia  associated with the area. The place first became connected with being a honeymoon destination in 1801, when Theodosia Burr, the daughter of Vice-president Aaron Burr, visited the region during her honeymoon. The French aristocracy  is also believed to have been early fans of honeymooning at the falls. In fact, French prince Jerome Bonaparte supposedly traveled to the Ontario side of Niagara Falls after his own wedding in 1804 to an American heiress. By the early 1900s, Niagara Falls had claimed itself as the Honeymoon Capital and began to advertise as such. In the 21st century, some young couples choosing to honeymoon in the spot have stated that doing so was a chance to visit the same location previously enjoyed by their parents or even their grandparents. The fact that the destination may also be less expensive than some more exotic  wedding locations has also helped it attract a large number of visiting newlyweds each year. Part of the charm of honeymooning at Niagara Falls might be the natural attraction's ability to combine old-fashioned romance with more contemporary attractions. Newlyweds seeking more private and separated activities may enjoy restaurants featuring candlelight dinners and dancing, quiet picnic areas surrounded by the signs and smells of nature, or a scenic lighthouse tour. On the other hand, couples seeking adventurous activities might find it appealing to visit a casino , take boat or air tours, or stay at a resort hotel. Why is Niagara Falls called the Honeymoon Capital of the World?", "subject": ""}
{"answer": 1, "choices": ["It's less expensive than the other side.", "It provides a better view of both waterfalls.", "People can exchange their vows there while at the other side they can't.", "It combines old-fashioned romance with modern attractions."], "question": "Honeymooning at Niagara Falls has become a standard for millions of newly married couples. In fact, Niagara Falls is often fondly called the Honeymoon Capital of the World. This title, however, did not happen overnight. There are various reasons that explain why so many people choose to get married surrounded by a waterfall backdrop. These reasons often include the wonderful natural setting, its unique history, and the inclusion of various activities and attractions that please newlyweds. The Niagara Falls is the waterfalls and twin cities of the same name located on the Niagara River. The waterfalls are situated in the international border between the United States and Canada and are part of both countries. The United States part of the waterfall is in New York state, while the Canadian section is part of Ontario. Both waterfalls are further divided into two major sections: the American Falls, located on the American side, and the Horseshoe Falls, which lies mostly on the Canadian side. A number of tourists who have watched the rush of water falling down Niagara Falls have described the view using many terms, including magical, magnificent, and breathtaking. For many recently married couples, visiting the Canadian side of Niagara Falls is generally more popular, as it provides a better view of the rushing water of both waterfalls. Both sides, however, function as destination wedding sites and offer engaged couples the opportunity to exchange their vows  at various churches and gardens located within the area. Some couples, however, may prefer to get married on the Canadian side to receive a honeymoon certificate signed by the city's mayor.  Another reason why couples state that they choose to celebrate their weddings at Niagara Falls is the sense of history and nostalgia  associated with the area. The place first became connected with being a honeymoon destination in 1801, when Theodosia Burr, the daughter of Vice-president Aaron Burr, visited the region during her honeymoon. The French aristocracy  is also believed to have been early fans of honeymooning at the falls. In fact, French prince Jerome Bonaparte supposedly traveled to the Ontario side of Niagara Falls after his own wedding in 1804 to an American heiress. By the early 1900s, Niagara Falls had claimed itself as the Honeymoon Capital and began to advertise as such.

The university of the past is not like the university of the present and the university of the present will not be like the university of the future.

In the past the professors would lecture endlessly to the students, which often left the students bored and with no idea what was really said to them in the lecture. This is no way to try and teach students; students need interaction with the professors that are paid to teach them.

Also, these rush hour commuters usually travel alone.     As a result, transport authorities in the UK are looking at solutions to city center congestion . One is to increase the number of parking spaces at out-of-town railway stations. More motorists can then leave their cars and travel into the city by train. Light rail or tramways are another environmentally friendly solution. Many cities across Europe have had light rail or tramway systems. The subway in London is used by everyone, rich and poor.

Chinese climbers plan to take the Olympic flame to the top of the world's highest peak, at 8,848 meters (29,028 feet) as part of the global relay leading up to the August 8 opening of the Summer Olympics in Beijing. Spring is the most popular season for climbing Mount Everest, which straddles  the border between Nepal and Tibet, an autonomous region of China.  The Nepali government has given permits to dozens of climbers from 30 expeditions this season.  But between May 1 and May 10, climbers are  _ from going above 6,400 meters until the torch run is completed. China plans to take the Olympic flame to the summit sometime then. Bad weather conditions allow only about two opportunities in May for a push to the summit. The Chinese have not allowed any expedition to climb the mountain from the north side, according the Kathmandu representative of the Tibet China Mountaineering Association. Almost every day in the past month, Nepalese police have arrested pro-Tibet protesters from in front of the Chinese Embassy and the United Nations offices. The demonstrators are released later in the evening.   Supporters of Tibet punish the government's attitude toward the autonomous region, and many believe China should not have been awarded the honor of hosting the Olympic Games. Earlier torch relay stops in London, England; Paris, France; and San Francisco, California attracted tens of thousands of demonstrators.

{"answer": 2, "choices": ["They are not very stable.", "They cannot hold enough silicon.", "They have limited energy capacity.", "The space between the graphene sheets is too big."], "question": "Does it drive you crazy that your cell phone needs to be frequently charged for hours? A team of scientists led by professor Harold Kung at Northwestern University in the US may have solved your problem. They developed a lithium ion batery   that holds 10 times as much power and charges 10 times more quickly than standard batteries, according to the BBC in a report on November 15. Lithium ion bateries are rechargeable and are widely used in cameras, smartphones and laptops. They charge through a chemical reaction in which lithium ions   are sent between the two ends of a battery. How much power the battery holds and how fast it charges are limited by two things:how many lithium ions it has and how quickly these ions move. Current rechargeable batteries have an anode   made of many carbon-based graphene   sheets. To increase energy capacity, former experiments have tried to replace the carbon with silicon, which can hold far more lithium ions. However, this method did not work because the silicon was not stable enough. Kung's team managed to stabilize the silicon. They put clusters   of silicon between the graphene sheets like a sandwich so that the silicon could not move around freely and take away the energy. The speed at which a battery charges is hindered   by the shape of the graphene sheets because it takes a long time for the lithium to travel from one side of the sheet to the other.Sometimes a \"traffic jam\" occurs around the edges of the graphene. To solve this problem, Kung's team used a special chemical process to create tiny holes of 10 to 20 nanometers wide in the graphene sheets so the lithium ions would have a \"shortcut\" and be able to travel directly to the other side. This reduced the time it took the battery to recharge. About 15 minutes of charging can last more than a week.  \"Even after 150 charges, which would be one year or more of operation, the battery is still five times more effective than lithium ion batteries on the market today,\" said Kung. The technology could be widely available within five years, the researchers said. What is the major problem of current rechargeable batteries?", "subject": ""}

This will also make your more of an interesting person than a person who is addicted to Facebook, watching TV, or doing other time wasting and unhealthy tasks. Think of a hobby that might interest you. It might be an interest that you always wished you had time to explore, but never had the time or money required to pursue your interest. Collect things for a fashion magazine. Look at the walls in your post office, and think about collecting stamps and what you might need to do to start and maintain a stamp collection.

Almost 13% of people aged between 15 and 24 - or almost 75 million - have no work, although this is slightly down on its peak in 2009.

Even in East Asia, perhaps the most economically active region, the unemployment rate was 2.8 times higher for young people than for adults, the report said. But, the ILO report reveals, the true picture of youth unemployment is even more pessimistic. Many young people are extending their time in higher education because they cannot find jobs. Others are taking part-time unskilled work because they cannot find work in the fields they trained for. The ILO says that more than six million young people worldwide have given up looking for work and are becomingly increasingly detached from society.

SallieMae found some good news in the fact that two thirds of students had discussed credit issues with their parents, but 84 percent said they needed more information.Those who didn't get any guidance were more likely to be surprised when they found out how much they owed. While credit cards offer the easiest access to money, they make it easy to live outside your means.Less than a fifth of students surveyed paid off their balance every month, and carrying a balance brings finance charges, sometimes at a very high interest rates. SallieMae found that almost 40 percent of students chose their first credit card based on direct mail, which is probably why students get credit card offers in the mail. But when the credit card offers flow in, be sure that you read the fine print.Offers of low or no interest rates can disappear, leaving you a debt that climbs beyond your ability to pay it off. According to SallieMae, how many students had not discussed credit issues with their parents?", "subject": ""}

Of course, the second speaker does not mean he heard the news about John by putting his ear to a grapevine!

Thus, their son, Andreas, began practicing the violin at eight, and his younger brother, Christoph, had piano lessons.

But Anne-Sophie has always had a mind of her own. \"I longed to play the violin,\" she says. \"It seemed to me a much more interesting instrument.\" After six months, her parents gave in. The famous violin teacher Erna Honigberger, who lived nearby, became Anne-Sophie's tutor. After only nine months of lessons, she entered the six-year-old in a nationwide competition for young musicians. With Christoph accompanying her on the piano, Anne-Sophie won first prize.

New research led by the University of Exeter challenges the long held belief that oxygenation of the atmosphere and oceans was a precondition for the evolution of complex life forms. The study, published in the journal Nature Geoscience, builds on the recent work of scientists in Denmark who found that sponges the first animals to evolverequire only small amounts of oxygen. Professor Tim Lenton of the University of Exeter, who led the new study, said: \"We argue that the evolution of the first animals could have played a key role in the widespread oxygenation of the deep oceans. This in turn may have the evolution of more complex, mobile animals.\" Critical to determining oxygen levels in the deep ocean is the balance of oxygen supply and demand. Demand for oxygen is created by the sinking of dead organic material into the deep ocean. The new study argues that the first animals reduced this supply of organic matterboth directly and indirectly. Sponges feed by pumping water through their bodies, \"digesting\" the tiny particles of organic matter, and thus helping oxygenate the shelf seas that they live in. By oxygenating more of the bottom waters, the first animals actually increased the removal of the essential nutrient phosphorus in the ocean. This in turn reduced the productivity of the whole ocean ecosystem, lowering oxygen demand and thus oxygenating the deep ocean. A more oxygen-rich ocean created ideal conditions for more complex mobile animals to evolve, because they have a higher requirement for oxygen. These included the first predatory animals with guts that started to eat one another, marking the beginning of the type of food webs we are familiar with today. Professor Simon Poulton of the University of Leeds, who is a co-author of the study, added: \"This study provides a possible mechanism for ocean oxygenation without the requirement for a rise in atmospheric oxygen. It therefore questions whether the long-standing belief that there was a major rise in atmospheric oxygen at this time is correct. We simply don't know the answer to this at present, which is ultimately key to understanding how our planet evolved to its current habitable state. Geochemists need to come up with new ways to explain oxygen levels on the early Earth.\" The main purpose of the passage is to   _   .", "subject": ""}

Is there a better way to learn how to communicate effectively? Yes, there is. Please follow the 3 basic steps below. 1. Relax and Breathe. Whether it's a business meeting or the first date, the first thing you must do in order to communicate is to relax. When you relax you are in control. You control your reactions and your reactions do not control you. Breathing is central to relaxation. Take a few deep breaths and your body will begin to be more at ease. This will help you apply what you already know about how to communicate well. 2. Think and you will be prepared. Have you ever heard the old saying, \"think before you speak\"? Well, it is true. By thinking ahead about how the conversation might flow, you will be better prepared, more at ease and more confident. 3. Follow the flow of the conversation. If you are uncomfortable, being silent will only make it worse and make the other person uncomfortable as well. So when all else fails, follow through with small talk until a common topic appears. A good way to keep a conversation going is to ask the other person questions. People love to talk about themselves and if you do this they will think very highly of you. .

{"answer": 1, "choices": ["Hollywood stars' ads cannot go up in Venice", "the mayor of Venice is expecting new advertising", "the Dotter Group may stop its restoration work for lack of funds", "people can buy Bulgaria or Coca-cola on the Bridge of Sighs"], "question": "According to legend, the Bridge of Sighs in Venice, Italy, which connects the Palazzo Ducale to an ancient prison, got its name because the walk across it gave prisoners on their way to jail a final chance to appreciate the beauty of the city. The view from the bridge today, however, is more likely to be of a giant billboard selling Bulgari or Coca - cola. Beyond the billboards, monuments are being restored. The money comes from advertising profits. But when the Coke billboards went up this summer on buildings near the Piazza San Marco, which is at the historic heart of Venice, there was a public debate. \"We can't commercialize everything,\" said Alessandra Mottola Molfino, a Venetian. \"The lesson that goes out is that a price is for everything.\" \"We couldn't stay quiet,\" said Maria Camilla Bianchini d'Alberigo, president of a heritage protection association. \"Too much is too much.\" There needed to be rules, she added, rules that prevent the advertising billboards clashing   with the monuments of the city. City of officials, however, argue that without these ads, the city could not afford to maintain its heritage. Many have been damaged by centuries of wear and are even a threat to public safety. \"I can't turn down the image of bottle when there are pieces of the Palazzo Ducale falling to the ground,\" said Renata Codello, a Cultrue Ministry official. The Culture Minister has a budget of about $ 47 million (315 million yuan) for restoration of monuments, but Italy has a rich architectural heritage, and funds are always tight.Of that amount, $ 1.8 million was given to the entire Vector region,  which includes Venice. Two years ago, the city signed an agreement with the Dotter Group, a company responsible for the restoration of the Bridge of Sighs and the Palazzo Ducale.It allows it to sell ad space. But there is a condition in the agreement: The ads should not offend public taste, In August, Venice banned US actress Julianne Moore's Bulgrari ad from a billboard in the Piazza San Marco. The photo shows a naked Moore covered with lion cubs, handbags and jewelry, Mayor Giorgio Orsoni called the image too racy   and unsuitable for the Piazza San Marco. \"I take account of the fact that Venice is part of the real world... but we cannot accept these Hollywood-style images.There arc intelligent sponsors, and we need to come up with advertising that suits Venice, not Times Square,\" he said in a speech.

Japan's Meteorological Agency released its first tsunami warnings just three minutes later. The country has one of the best earthquake early warning systems in the world. More than 4,000 Seismic Intensity Meters provide information within two minutes of an earthquake happening.  There are also concrete sea walls around much of the Japanese coastline. But these measures proved no match for the powerful earthquake and tsunami.  Costas Synolakis is a tsunami expert in the University of Southern California in Los Angeles. He says: \"Japan is one of those most well-prepared countries on earth in terms of tsunami warning. They had a warning. I think what went wrong is that they had not anticipated the size of this event.\" He says there are two reasons for this. First, scientists had not expected such a large earthquake. The 9.0 magnitude earthquake was the 4th most powerful earthquake ever recorded worldwide. It was also the worst ever to hit Japan. The tsunami waves reached as high as 13 meters in some areas. Second, Japan's concrete sea walls were not built to handle such high waves.  \" In Sendai , they were about three meters. At least in that area they were not expecting such a sizeable wave because they would have built a higher seawall.\"  A tsunami wave can travel as fast as 800 kilometers per hour.

On Thanksgiving morning, I drove up to fetch him for a turkey dinner, and while he finished getting ready, I stole his spare car keys. So Dad spent the night at my house. The next day, after a long talk in which he still refused to relinquish his keys, I drove him home with a friend, who would drive my father's car back to my place. I was so nervous and eager for the whole thing to be over, so I got a speeding ticket on the way. My father never fully forgave the theft of his car, although as the months passed and his dementia  worsened. One reason my father had been so eager to keep driving was that his younger brother Wes lived in a county home. Wes had been born mentally challenged  and later suffered from schizophrenia , my father had driven monthly to see him. It seemed right to help them see each other. So, seven years ago, Jim and I borrowed a van  equipped for a wheelchair ,picked up Wes and took him for Thanksgiving with my father. At my father's place, we moved Wes in his chair out of the van and up to the door. When the brothers saw each other, their faces lit up. \"Is that you, bud?\" Wes called out, half rising from his seat. \"Wes!\"My father cried. They grasped each other's hands firmly, smiled at each other, their joy obvious. Slowly, we made our way back to my father's apartment; my husband walked alongside my father while I pushed Wes in his chair. That was last time my father saw his brother. Wes passed away a few months later. My father continued to worsen. That was our last Thanksgiving together. He died in 2011, a few months shy of his 96th birthday. That means there will be no car tricks this year, no wheelchair van and there will never again be multiple generations of our family at the same table.

Class, power and status are important in deciding people's rank in society. Class means a person's economic position in society. A commonly used classification is lower class, middle class and upper class. While sociologists disagree on how these terms should be exactly defined, they do describe societies like the United States quite well. One study shows that 53% of Americans belong to the lower class, 46% the middle class, and 1% the upper class. Interestingly, a surgeon earning $500,000 a year and a bus driver earning $50,000 a year both regard themselves as the middle class! Power refers to the amount of control a person has over other people. Obviously, people in positions of great power (such as governors) exercise big power, but people who take orders from others have less power. Power and class do not always go hand in hand, however. For example, the governor of a state has great power, but he or she may not belong to a corresponding  economic class. Generally, however, there is a relationship between power and class. To our knowledge, there aren't too many people who aren't millionaires in the U.S. Senate! Status is the honor or respect attached to a person's position in society. It can also be affected by power and class, but not necessarily so. For example, a university professor may have a high status but not belong to a high social class or have a lot of power over others. According to the text, we know that   _  .", "subject": ""}

The same is true of big solar plants and the power lines that will be laid down to move electricity around. The 19 th century saw land grants  offered to railroad companies to build the transcontinental railroads, leaving public land in between privately owned land. In much of the West, some of the railroad sections were developed while others remained undeveloped, and in both cases the landownership has presented unique challenges to land management. With the completion of the interstate highway system, many of the small towns, which sprang up as railway stops and developed well, have lost their lifeblood and died. Big solar plants and their power lines will also have effects far beyond their direct footprint in the West. This is not an argument against building them. We need alternative energy badly, and to really take advantage of it we need to be able to move electricity around far more readily than we can now. So trade-offs will have to be made.

While his friends were meeting for pickup soccer games after school, he was back home in his room reading and rereading the same material. But no matter how hard Noah studied, he had difficulty remembering things and his grades stayed average. Meanwhile, his friend Sean, who never seemed to study, always aced tests. It didn't seem fair. Because Noah was so frustrated  , his dad and teachers made an appointment with the school psychologist. She diagnosed   Noah with a learning disability. Although Noah felt relieved to know what was going on, he was also worried. He didn't like the \"disability\" label. And he was concerned about what it might mean for his future. Would he be able to go to college and study engineering as he'd hoped? For someone diagnosed with a learning disability, it can seem scary at first. But a learning disability doesn't have anything to do with a person's intelligence. After all, such successful people as Walt Disney, Alexander Graham Bell, and Winston Churchill all had learning disabilities. Learning disabilities are problems that affect the brain's ability to receive, process, analyze, or store information. These problems can make it difficult for a student to learn as quickly as someone who isn't affected by learning disabilities. The way our brains process information is extremely complex --- it's no wonder things can get messed up sometimes. Take the simple act of looking at a picture, for example: Our brains not only have to form the lines into an image, they also have to recognize what the image stands for, relate that image to other facts stored in our memories, and then store this new information. It's the same thing with speech - we have to recognize the words, interpret the meaning, and figure out the significance of the statement to us. Many of these activities take place in separate parts of the brain, and it's up to our minds to link them all together. If, like Noah, you've been diagnosed with a learning disability, you're not alone. Nearly four million school-age children and teens have learning disabilities, and at least 20% of them have a type of disorder that makes it difficult to focus.

When Washington wrote that, Englishmen had been referring to insects as bugs for more than a century,and Americans had already created lightning-bug .But the English were soon to stop using the bugs in their language, leaving it to the Americans to call a bug a bug in the nineteenth and twentieth centuries. The American bug could also be a person, referring to someone who was crazy about a particular activity. Although fan became the usual term, sports fans used to be called racing bugs, baseball bugs, and the like. Or the bug could be a small machine or object, for example, a bug-shaped car.

No, it's not a visit from their mothers, and not a threat to take away their cellphones or pocket money. It's high-frequency noise. The UK police recently agreed to use a device   called the Sonic Teenager Deterrent. It sends out a sound that makes teenagers become so impatient and angry that they have to cover their ears tightly and walk away. The sound is at extreme high-pitch that can be heard by those under 20. The body's natural ability to detect some wave bands decreases almost entirely after 20, so few adults can hear the sounds. The black-box device, nicknamed the Mosquito because of its sound, can be fixed to the outside walls of shops, offices and homes. It sounds to youngsters like a crazy insect or a badly played violin. But it causes no physical damage. A number of police forces and councils have given permission to use the system and want to install   it at trouble spots. Staffordshire Police Inspector Amanda Davies, who has given the device to shopkeepers in the Moorlands area, said,\" It is controlled by the shopkeepers--if they can see through their window that there is a problem, they turn the device on for a while until the group has run away.\" The device can be used to   _  .", "subject": ""}
