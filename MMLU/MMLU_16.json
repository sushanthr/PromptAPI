{"answer": 3, "choices": ["Peers have a good effect", "Children give in to peer pressure", "Peer pressure is hard to resist", "Peer pressure"], "question": "A peer is a person who is about the same age as you. Peers affect your life, whether you know it or not, just by spending time with you. Peers can have a good effect on one another. Maybe another student in your science class taught you an easy way to remember the planets in solar system. Maybe you got others excited about your new favorite book and now everyone's reading it. However, sometimes peers affect one another in another way. For example, one kid in school might try to get another to cut class with him, your soccer friend might try to persuade you to be mean to another player and never pass her the ball, or a kid in the neighborhood might want you to with him. Some kids give in to peer pressure because they want to be liked, to fit in, or because they worry that other kids may make fun of them if they don't go along with the group. Others may go along because they are curious to try something new that others are doing. The idea that \" everyone's doing it\" may influence some kids to leave their better judgments or their common senses behind. Peer pressure can be extremely strong and hard to get rid of.

Less well known is the advantage that Adam Abbot has in life over Zoe Zysman. English names are fairly spread between the halves of the alphabet. Yet a quite large number of top people have surnames beginning with letters between A and K. Thus the American presidents and vice-presidents have surnames starting with B and  C separately and 26 of those before George Bush took office (including his father ) had surnames in the first half of the alphabet against just 16 in the second half. Even more striking, six of the seven heads of government of the G7 rich countries are alphabetically advantaged (Berlusconi, Blair, Bush, Chirac, Chretien and Koizumi). The world's three top central bankers ( Greenspan, Duisenberg and Hayami)are all close to the top of the alphabet, even if one of them really uses Japanese characters.

Now home to Queen Elizabeth II, it's been the British Monarchy's official London digs since 1837. National Geographic Kids slipped behind the guarded gates to find the palace's coolest features. 1. FANCY FEAST For special dinners, a team of 21 chefs _ dishes that are served on solid gold plates. Even Her Majesty's pet dogs receive meals of lamb and cabbage in silver bowls. Good thing the kitchen is well stocked--- the Queen welcomes about 50,000 dining guests every year. 2. CLASSY COACH The Queen's most attractive ride may be the Gold State Coach, parked in the palace's Royal Mews building and used in the crowning of a king or queen, since 1821. Covered with heavy gold, it's pulled by eight horses. 3. MOVIE NIGHT The royal family hosts private screenings of movie in their very own cinema, sometimes seeing new films before they hit theaters. 4. WHAT'S UP, DOC? Forget a medicine cabinet  . Buckingham Palace houses a doctor's office run by the Queen's physician. And surgeons have performed operations in other parts of the palace. In 1902, for instance, doctors operated on King Edward VII in a room facing the garden. 5. BEDROOMS The palace has 52 bedrooms. Rooms such as those inside the Belgian Suite contain chandeliers , gold-gilded mirrors, fireplaces, canopy beds, and more. 6. TOP- SECRET TUNNELS Rumor has it that secret underground tunnels connect the royal residence to other buildings in London. The paths were reportedly built during World War II when enemy bombs regularly pounded the city.

{"answer": 3, "choices": ["Western medicine", "acupuncture and herbal medicine", "advances in medical technology", "integrative medicine"], "question": "The human body is an amazing and complex machine. It is very tough, and we usually recover from illness or injury on our own, without the help of a doctor. But what happens when we need medical treatment? In the past, some people went to a clinic or hospital to see a medical doctor. Other people trusted ancient traditions and chose treatments such as herbal  medicine or acupuncture . These two types of medicine----one modern and Western and the other ancient and Eastern----used to have nothing to do with each other. In recent years, however, people around the world have begun to recognize and accept both modern medical science and more traditional therapies. This new kind of medicine can be called integrative medicine (because it integrates, or combines, different types of medicine), or complementary medicine. Some of the principles of this type of medicine include preventing illness by helping people stay healthy, integrating different types of therapies according to the needs of each patient, and considering the health of the whole person rather than concentrating on a particular illness or injury. One health maintenance organization (HMO) in Madison, Wisconsin, has opened its Complementary Medicine and Wellness Center. At the center, HMO members are offered a variety of services. If you are suffering a sore back, try some massage treatments to relax your muscles and encourage the flow of healing energy in your body. If you have allergies or asthma, you could try homeopathy, which uses tiny amounts of allergens to stimulate your body's natural immune response. And if you're not ill, but just want to improve your strength and focus your mind, try a tai chi or yoga class. Patients who use these complementary medicine services appreciate having an alternative to surgery or to drugs and their side effects. They also enjoy activities and therapies that make them feel better even if they're not sick. And from the financial point of view of the HMO, preventing illness whenever possible is much less expensive than a hospital stay. According to Dr. Andrew Weil, founder of the Program in Integrative Medicine at the University of Arizona, integrative medicine combines the best parts of Western medicine with complementary therapies such as acupuncture and nutrition.

Personally Nike is my favorite one--it's so simple. And I liked the stories behind them, which made me forget all other things. McDonald's, Apple, Mercedes Benz and Adidas own great logos as well, and they are among my favorites. Nike In the Greek myth, Nike is the goddess of victory and the source of inspiration for soldiers. This logo represents the wing in the famous statue of the Greek goddess. Nike's logo was designed by Carolyn Davidson in 1971 for $ 35, and was registered as a trademark in 1995. McDonald's The logo was designed in 1962 by Jim Schindler to resemble the archshaped  signs on the side of the company's then walk-up hamburger stand. Later on, the two golden arches were combined together to form the M. The McDonald's name was added to the logo in 1968. Apple There are different stories behind Apple's logo. The first logo was a reference to the religious story of Adam and Eve, in which the apple represented the fruit of the Tree of Knowledge. One year later, the second logo was designed in 1977 by Steven Jobs and Ronald Wayne, and it described Sir Isaac Newton sitting under an apple tree. This logo didn't stay long. One year later it was replaced almost immediately by graphic designer Rob Janoff's \" rainbow apple\", a rainbow- colored silhouette    of an apple with a bite taken out of it. And then the rainbow- colored apple was replaced by the one- colored logo in 1998. It has not been changed so far. Mercedes Benz The Mercedes Benz logo, which was originally created by Gottlieb Daimler in 1909, consists of a simple description of a three- pointed star that represents its rule of the land, the sea and the air. The company was founded by Gottlieb Daimler and Wilhelm Maybach. Marcedes is the name of Maybach's elder daughter, while Benz came as a result of a combination with Benz, Cie.and DMG in 1926. Adidas The Adidas logo, which was created by the founder of the company Adi Dassler, represents mountains, pointing towards the challenges that are seen ahead and goals that can be achieved. The logo was used for the first time in 1976. What does the author think of the stories of the great logos?", "subject": ""}

For many years I emphasized its harmlessness. When concerned parents expressed doubt about letting their children have toy guns, because they didn't want to encourage them in the slightest degree to become criminals, I would explain how little connection there was.

One- to two-year-olds, when they are angry with another child, may bite the child's arm without hesitation. But by 3 or 4 they have already learned that aggression is not right. However, they may pretend to shoot their mother or father, but smiling to assure them that the gun and the aggressive behaviour aren't to be taken seriously. In the 6- to 12-year-old period, children will play an earnest game of war, but it has lots of rules. There may be arguments, but real fights are relatively rare. At this age children don't shoot at their mother or father, even in fun. It's not that the parents have turned stricter; the children's own conscience has. In adolescence aggressive feelings become much stronger, but well brought-up children can turn them into athletics and other competition or into kidding their friends. In other words, I'd explain that playing at war is a natural step in the disciplining of the aggression of young children; that a cautious parent doesn't really need to worry about producing a criminal. But nowadays I'd give parents much more encouragement to guide their child away from violence. A number of incidents have convinced me of the importance of this. One of the first things that made me change my mind, several years ago, was an observation that an experienced nursery school teacher told me about. Her children were hitting each other much more than previously, without reason. When she talked to them, they would protest, \"But that's what the Three Stooges do.\" (This was a children's TV program full of violence which immediately became very popular.) What further shocked me into reconsidering my view was the assassination of the former President, and the fact that some schoolchildren cheered about this. (I didn't so much blame the children as I blamed the kind of parents who will say about a President they dislike, \"I'd shoot him if I got the chance!\") These incidents made me think of other evidences that Americans often tolerate lawlessness and violence. We were hard on the Indians and the later waves of immigrants. At times we denied justice to groups with different religions or political views. And now a great percentage of our adult as well as our child population has been endlessly fascinated with dramas of Western violence and with cruel crime stories, in movies and on television. This doesn't necessarily mean that we Americans on the average have more aggressiveness inside us than the people of other nations. I think rather that the aggressiveness we have is less controlled, from childhood on. To me it seems very clear that in order to have a more stable and civilized national life we must bring up the next generation of Americans with a greater respect for law and for other people's rights than in the past. There are many ways in which we could and should teach these attitudes. One simple opportunity we could seize in the first half of childhood is to show our disapproval of lawlessness and violence in television programs and in children's gun play. I also believe that the survival of the world now depends on a much greater awareness of the need to avoid war and to actively seek peaceful agreements.

Experts say if you decide to put your baby to sleep with a bottle, give him only water. When baby's teeth begin to appear, you can clean them with a wet toothbrush. Dentists say it is important to find soft toothbrushes made especially for babies and to use them very gently. Young children often eat toothpaste   when they brush, so they should be carefully watched when they brush their teeth. Parents often ask what effect thumb sucking   might have on their baby's teeth. Experts generally agree that this is fine early in life. Most children stop sucking their thumbs by the age of four. If _ continues, parents should talk to their children's dentist or doctor. Dentists say children should have their first dental visit by the time they are one year old. They say babies should be examined when their first teeth appear usually at around six months.

Second, ants think winter all summer. That's an important viewpoint. You can't be so naive ( ) as to think summer will last forever. So ants are gathering in their winter food in the middle of summer. An ancient story says, \"Don't build your house on the sand in the summer. \" Why do we need that advice.'? Because it is important to be realistic. In the summer, you've got to think storm. You've got to think rocks as you enjoy the sand and sun. Think ahead. The third part of the ant philosophy is that ants think summer all winter. That is so important. During the winter, ants remind themselves, \"This won't last long ; we'll soon be out of here. \" And on the first warm day, the ants are out. If it turns cold again, they'll dive back down, but then they come out on the first warm day. They can't wait to get out. And here's the last part of the ant-philosophy. How much will an ant gather during the summer to prepare for the winter? All he possibly can. What an incredible philosophy, the \"all-you-possibly-can\" philosophy. Wow, what a great seminar to attend -- the ant seminar. Never give up, look ahead, stay positive and do all you can. Which of the following is the best title for the passage?", "subject": ""}

Tobacco smoke contains more than 7,000 chemicals, hundreds of which are poisonous.

And \"low-level\" means when a parent or family member smokes in another room or even outside.  While second-hand smoke can be harmful to people of all ages, children face a greater risk than adults: they have smaller lungs; they breathe more quickly; and they have less developed immune  systems.  Also, young children have little control over their surroundings. Babies can't move to another room because the air is smoky. They depend on the adults in their lives to make sure that their environments are safe.

The ritual began after breakfast when Dad always announced: \"Go ahead everyone. I'll take care of the dishes!\" With that my mother disappeared into the folds of the Sunday paper. Off came the suit coat he had worn to church that morning. Up went the shirtsleeves. On went that apron. For the next hour Dad did the dishes, singing ballads like \"I Had a Hat When I Came In\" and \"Who Put the Chow in Mrs. Murphy's Chowder?\" I suppose it was strange for a boy's father to wear an apron - even one with race cars - but I never thought much of it until the day that Dad broke with tradition. It was the last Sunday in August. My father seemed in an expansive mood as we walked home from church together. \"Tommy,\" he said letting my name roll off his tongue. My mind raced ahead of his words: The birds and the bees? A new bike?  A part-time job? \"There comes a time in every boy's life when he must take on responsibilities.\" This was important. I might even get to back the car out of the driveway. \"Responsibilities?\" I asked. \"Yes. It's time you took a greater role in the household.\" Power tools? Boss my baby brother? \"Starting today, I want you to do the dishes on Sunday morning so your mother and I can work the crossword puzzle together.\" \"The dishes!?\" \"Anything wrong with taking over the dishes, son?\" I started to say something about a man's job or woman's work, but I knew immediately that my protests would fall on deaf ears. I didn't taste a bit of breakfast that morning. Dad seemed in a jovial mood as he described an exceptional Yankee game seen through the eyes of Mel Allen on the radio last night. \"Mickey Mantle drove the ball right over the center field wall,\" he said. \"Just a straight line climb in right out of the stadium.\" He looked out the window as if trying to pick the ball out of the cloud formations. I tried to imagine Mickey Mantle wearing an apron. Suddenly, everything grew quiet. My sister began to clear the table. My brother was scraping the last of the egg from his plate. And then that ancient family ritual that had filled so many Sunday mornings came to an end. My father announced: \"Let's go read the paper, Hon.\" \"Aren't you doing the dishes?\" my mother asked in puzzlement. \"Your oldest son has generously offered to fill the position.\" My brother and sister stopped cold. So this was what my life had come to. A dark angel sat on my left shoulder and reminded me that I could hit a baseball farther than anyone in my class. I could bench-press my weight. I knew three declensions in Latin, the language of Caesar. Ask me to run through a rainstorm. Command me to ride the roller coaster - backward. These things I would do. But I could never do those dishes. There was nothing left but to refuse. People often say there is a special chemistry between a father and a son. He came back into the kitchen just as I was about to storm out. He had loosened his tie and rolled up the sleeves of his shirt - ready to relax. In his right hand was the old apron. \"I want you to have this, Tommy. It'll keep your clothes from getting wet.\" And before I could mount a protest, he had put the thing on me. \"Thanks, Son. Your mother and I appreciate this.\" With that he disappeared into the Sunday paper. I looked down at the plastic. It had seen better days. I could see my dad reaching for the dishes. The dark angel flew off. Soon I was singing about Mrs. Murphy's chowder. The words came out of nowhere. And out of nowhere I knew the kind of man I wanted to be.

I might even get to back the car out of the driveway. \"Responsibilities?\" I asked. \"Yes. It's time you took a greater role in the household.\" Power tools? Boss my baby brother? \"Starting today, I want you to do the dishes on Sunday morning so your mother and I can work the crossword puzzle together.\" \"The dishes!?\" \"Anything wrong with taking over the dishes, son?\" I started to say something about a man's job or woman's work, but I knew immediately that my protests would fall on deaf ears. I didn't taste a bit of breakfast that morning. Dad seemed in a jovial mood as he described an exceptional Yankee game seen through the eyes of Mel Allen on the radio last night. \"Mickey Mantle drove the ball right over the center field wall,\" he said. \"Just a straight line climb in right out of the stadium.\" He looked out the window as if trying to pick the ball out of the cloud formations. I tried to imagine Mickey Mantle wearing an apron. Suddenly, everything grew quiet. My sister began to clear the table. My brother was scraping the last of the egg from his plate. And then that ancient family ritual that had filled so many Sunday mornings came to an end. My father announced: \"Let's go read the paper, Hon.\" \"Aren't you doing the dishes?\" my mother asked in puzzlement. \"Your oldest son has generously offered to fill the position.\" My brother and sister stopped cold. So this was what my life had come to. A dark angel sat on my left shoulder and reminded me that I could hit a baseball farther than anyone in my class. I could bench-press my weight. I knew three declensions in Latin, the language of Caesar. Ask me to run through a rainstorm. Command me to ride the roller coaster - backward. These things I would do. But I could never do those dishes. There was nothing left but to refuse. People often say there is a special chemistry between a father and a son. He came back into the kitchen just as I was about to storm out. He had loosened his tie and rolled up the sleeves of his shirt - ready to relax. In his right hand was the old apron. \"I want you to have this, Tommy. It'll keep your clothes from getting wet.\" And before I could mount a protest, he had put the thing on me. \"Thanks, Son. Your mother and I appreciate this.\" With that he disappeared into the Sunday paper. I looked down at the plastic. It had seen better days. I could see my dad reaching for the dishes. The dark angel flew off. Soon I was singing about Mrs. Murphy's chowder. The words came out of nowhere. And out of nowhere I knew the kind of man I wanted to be.

Thank you so much for taking on my \"children\" while I'm away. Like real children, they can be kind of irritating sometimes, but I'm going to enjoy myself so much more knowing they're getting some kind human attention. Remember that Regina (the \"queen\" in Latin, and she acts like one) is teething. If you don't watch her, she'll chew anything, including her sister, the cat. There are plenty of chew toys around the house. Whenever she starts gnawing on anything illegal, just give her one of those. She generally settles right down to a good hour-long chew. Then you'll see her wandering around whimpering with the remains of the toy in her mouth. She gets really frustrated because what she wants is to bury the thing. She'll try to dig a hole between the cushions of the couch. Finding that unsatisfactory, she'll wander some more, discontent, until you solve her problem for her. I usually show her the laundry basket, moving a few clothes so she can bury her toy beneath them. I do sound like a parent, don't I? You have to understand, my own son is practically grown up.

She also needs a walk in the afternoon, after which it's important to romp with her for a while in the yard. The game she loves most is fetch, but be sure to make her drop the ball. She'd rather play tug of war with it. Tell her, \"Sit!\" Then, when she does, say, \"Drop it!\" Be sure to tell her \"good girl,\" and then throw the ball for her.

A study investigated whether taking notes by hand helps you learn better than taking notes on a laptop. It was no contest. Study authors and psychologists Pam A. Mueller of Princeton University and Daniel M. Oppenheimer of the University of California- Los Angeles conducted three separate experiments involving a total of 327 students. All students got the same lectures, but some used laptops, and others took notes by hand. When it came to learning the concepts, the handwriters won. When it came to retrieving facts, the groups were comparable, except when given time to go home and look at their notes, at which point the handwriters did better. \"Even when allowed to reviewnotes after a week's delay, participants who had taken notes with laptops performed worse on tests of both factual content and conceptual understanding,\" the study states.

Students who paid attention and took deep notes on their laptop still didn't learn as well--in fact, the study suggests the thoroughness of their notes contributes to the problem.

Now the city is slowly sinking, as the clay on which it is built loses its elasticity   and the massive wooden piles rot   away. Flooding, such a rare occurrence a hundred years ago now happens several times each winter. The damage caused by the flooding is immense, and the fabric of the ancient buildings is now being further damaged by pollution from the mainland town as well as by the wash produced by the constantly increasing number of motor boats that speed up and down the canals. A further threat to Venice comes from the Venetians themselves, some of whom are not particularly interested in preserving the city as one of the wonders of the world and would prefer to see it modernized. \"What better place is there for the meeting of dear friends? See how it glows with the advancing summer; how the sky and the sea and the rosy air and the marble of the palaces all glimmer and melt together.\" Thus wrote the famous author Henry James, of Venice, which provided the setting for his story \"The Aspern Papers\", in the nineteenth century.

The damage caused by the flooding is immense, and the fabric of the ancient buildings is now being further damaged by pollution from the mainland town as well as by the wash produced by the constantly increasing number of motor boats that speed up and down the canals. A further threat to Venice comes from the Venetians themselves, some of whom are not particularly interested in preserving the city as one of the wonders of the world and would prefer to see it modernized. \"What better place is there for the meeting of dear friends? See how it glows with the advancing summer; how the sky and the sea and the rosy air and the marble of the palaces all glimmer and melt together.\" Thus wrote the famous author Henry James, of Venice, which provided the setting for his story \"The Aspern Papers\", in the nineteenth century. The Splendor of Venice has captured the imagination of artists for centuries --- and not just of the great painters and novelists. How tragic now that she is faced with the double threat of man and nature. Venice indeed will be lucky to survive. The writer thinks that  _  .", "subject": ""}

The finding does not mean that only these six women gave rise to migrants who crossed into North America from Asia in the earliest population of the continent.Rather, it suggests that only six left a particular DNA legacy that persists to today in about 95% of Native Americans, said study co-author Ugo Perego in Utah.          \"The women did not necessarily arrive together, nor even all live at the same time,\" he said.Results indicate the women arrived sometime between 18,000 and 21,000 years ago.          The work was published this week by the journal PLoS One.Perego is from the Sorenson Molecular Genealogy Foundation in Salt Lake City and the University of Pavia in Italy.The work confirms the previous indications of just six maternal lineages, as well as a date of around 20,000 years ago when the first people in North America arrived after crossing a land bridge from Asia, Perego said.          The researchers studied mitochondrial   DNA, which is passed only from mother to daughter.They created a \"family tree\" that traces the different DNA  _ found in today's Native Americans.By noting mutations in each branch and applying a formula for how often such mutations arise, they calculated how old each branch was.That indicated when each branch arose in a single woman.          The six \"founding mothers\" obviously did not live in Asia because the DNA signatures they left behind are not found there, Perego said.So they probably lived in Beringia, the now-submerged land bridge that stretched to North America, he said.

It's one of those winter evenings when the coldness of every single thing seems to slow down time, like the narrow center of an hourglass which time itself flows through, but slowly, slowly. I had a sudden urge, tonight, here in the house by myself to write you a letter. I suddenly wanted to leave something, for after. I think that time is short, now. I feel as though all my reserves, of energy, of pleasure, of duration, are thin, small. I don't feel capable of continuing very much longer. I know you know. If you are reading this, I am probably dead. But you know: you know that if I could have stayed, if I could have gone on, that I would have seized every second: whatever it was, this death, you know that it came and took me, like a child carried away by goblins  . Clare, I want to tell you, again, I love you. But I hate to think of you waiting. I know that you have been waiting for me all your life, always uncertain of how long this patch of waiting would be. Ten minutes, ten days. A month. What an uncertain husband I have been, Clare, like a sailor. Please, Clare. When I am dead, stop waiting and be free. Of me--put me deep inside you and then go out in the world and live. Love the world and yourself in it, move through it as though the world is your natural element.  After my mom died she ate my father up completely. She would have hated it. Every minute of his life since then has been marked by her absence, every action has lacked dimension because she is not there to measure against. And when I was young I didn't understand, but now, I know, how absence can be present.  If I had to live on without you I know I could not do it. But I hope, I have this vision of you walking, with your shining hair in the sun. I have not seen this with my eyes, but only with my imagination, that makes pictures, that always wanted to paint you, shining; but I hope that this vision will be true, anyway.  Clare, there is one last thing, and I have hesitated to tell you, because I'm afraid that telling might cause it to not happen and also because I have just been going on about not waiting and this might cause you to wait longer than you have ever waited before. But I will tell you in case you need something, after.  Last summer, I was sitting in Kendrick's waiting room when I suddenly found myself in a dark hallway in a house I don't know. At the end of the hall I could see a rim of light around a door, and so I went very slowly and very quietly to the door and looked in. The room was white, and lit with morning sun. At the window, with her back to me, sat a woman, wearing a coral-color1ed cardigan sweater, with long white hair all down her back. She had a cup of tea beside her, on a table. I must have made some little noise, or she sensed me behind her...she turned and saw me, and I saw her, and it was you, Clare, this was you as an old woman, in the future. It was sweet, Clare, it was sweet beyond telling. I won't tell you any more, so you can imagine it. We will see each other again, Clare. Until then, live, fully, present in the world, which is so beautiful.  It's dark, now, and I am very tired. I love you, always. Time is nothing.

A child of any age will feel proud and grown-up if parents frequently show their trust. In court a defendant  is innocent until proved guilty. But in the family, a teenager \"defendant\" is too often assumed guilty. Even when the child is caught in a complete lie, this should not be the end of trust. A parent can tell a child that a single lie is forgivable. Yet it should be clear that if lies continue, the child, like the boy who cried wolf, will suffer loss of trust. When my wife and I discovered that our son Tom, then 13, had lied about throwing a party while we were away, we grounded him for a month. We also told Tom that we could no longer trust him, and we could not allow him to stay alone overnight again. This loss of freedom was an important lesson; he learned how hard it is to live with people when they don't trust him. As a result, now more than three years later we can again trust Tom to stay alone overnight. Parents must always remember there is no easy answer to this universal problem of lying. We can set a good example, allow for privacy, monitor friendship, develop trust and punish wrong doing, but still we discover our child has lied to us. Finally that's why there is a need for trust on both sides of a parent-child relationship. Lying destroys closeness and friendship.

English skills are important to Chinese if China wishes to play a stronger role on the world stage. However, the general English level of the Chinese people is on the decline.

The report triggered widespread discussion in China: in an increasingly international nation, why is the peoples' level of English getting worse? A decline in the English level of the Chinese people is no accident. With China's exam-based education system, worsening English is inevitable. English education in China is too focused on grammar and ignored oral practice. This results in students that are often too scared to speak, for fear of making a mistake. Exam-based courses make it so students merely learn for the test, not learn the language.

At the same time, the number of overseas returnees is increasing as well.

Difficulties and pressure in the job market for overseas returnees deters a number of Chinese from studying abroad. As a result, the number of Chinese with high-level English, carefully perfected abroad, has been reduced. This could be a major reason for why English is getting worse overall in China.

A day after moving to the Windy City last year, Outland started a new job and never got a chance to explore her new surroundings. After nine months as a resident, she finally took a week off work to visit famous landmarks, museums and shopping centers that were right under her nose. If you glance through a newspaper or listen to a news broadcast recently, you may hear or spot a strange word, \"staycation\". Staycation is a new word the American press is employing to describe a vacation very close to your home, or simply staying at home during your vacation. It is a combination of words \"stay\"and \"vacation\". According to many news reports, these staycations are achieving great popularity among American families this year. When asked about the reason for their expected staycation, respondents stated \"gas prices are too high\" (61 percent), \"travel in general is too expensive (44 percent). The high price of gas for cars and airplanes has made it very expensive for Americans to travel compared to past years. When you combine this with the weak American dollar, it all adds up to people deciding to stay close to home during their traditional summer vacations. For aggressive young Americans who are trying to balance family and work, a staycation can be a great concept. They want to enjoy their homes and the attractions in their area without the stress of packing or making reservation. They won't be paying high fuel prices either directly, at the pump, or indirectly, in airfare, other than the gas required to drive around town. Absolutely, it's friendlier on the environment when locals take trips to attractions in their own area, and not everyone is game for a vacation that involves staying on a hotel compound.

Shakespeare uses a linguistic technique known as functional change that involves, for example, using a noun to serve as a verb.Researchers found that this technique allows the brain to understand what a word means before it understands the function of the word within a sentence.This process causes a sudden peak in brain activity and forces the brain to work backwards in order to fully understand what Shakespeare is trying to say. Professor Philip Davis, from the university's School of English, said: \"The brain reacts to reading a phrase such as 'he godded me' from the tragedy of Coriolanus, in a similar way to putting a jigsaw puzzle together.If it is easy to see which pieces fit together you become bored of the game.But if the pieces don't appear to fit, when we know they should, the brain becomes excited.By throwing irregular words into seemingly normal sentences, Shakespeare surprises the brain in a manner that produces a sudden burst of activity -- a sense of drama created out of the simplest of things.\" Experts believe that this heightened brain activity may be one of the reasons why Shakespeare's plays have such a dramatic impact on their readers. Professor Neil Roberts, from the university's Magnetic Resonance and Image Analysis Research Center, and Professor Davis, together with Dr Guillaune Thierry, from the University of Wales, UK, monitored 20 participants using an electroencephalogram (EEG) as they read selected lines from Shakespeare's plays. \"The brain signal is relatively stable when we understand the meaning of a word but when the word changes the grammar of the whole sentence, brain readings suddenly peak.The brain is then forced to retrace its thinking process in order to understand what it is supposed to make of this unusual word,\" explains Professor Roberts.

One of my patients told me that when she tried to tell her story people often interrupted to tell her that they once had something just like that happening to them. Her pain became a story about themselves. Eventually she stopped talking to most people. We connect through listening. When we interrupt what someone is saying to let them know that we understand,we move the focus of attention to ourselves. When we listen,they know we care. I have even learned to respond to someone crying by just listening.

In a partnership announced, the two organizations said they would be working together to build a simulation   of a structure known as a neo-cortical column on a type of IBM supercomputer that is currently used to study the molecular functioning of genes. If that works, they plan to use more powerful computers to link such simulated columns together into something that mimics  a brain. In a real brain, a neo-cortical column is a cylindrical element about a third of a millimeter in diameter and three millimeters long. It is these columns, arranged side by side like the cells of a honeycomb, which make up the famous \"grey matter\" that has become shorthand for human intelligence. The Blue Gene/L supercomputer that will be used for the simulation consists of enough independent processors for each to be programmed to mimic an individual nerve cell in a column.

These imagined cowboys range from white-hat-wearing heroes to gun-shooting hooligans .But, cowboys are actually real people from US history. When the US Civil War ended, many soldiers had no place to call home. So, they began to drift to the country's rural West. Ranchers  hired these men to take care of the cattle and work around the ranch. When the ranch owner wanted to sell the cattle, the cowboys would round up the herd from the open prairie  and drive the cattle miles to the market. With the invention of barbed wire ,the cowboy era(1865-1890) began to come to an end. But people in the East had always been curious about their lifestyle. Many country/western songs during this time tried to capture the true cowboy spirit. Newspapers published cowboy tales in serial form and adventure novels followed. The bigger the fiction,  the better the sales. These novels often portrayed cowboys as cruel and violent men. Cowboys carried the bad reputation for many years afterwards. When movies began to be popular in the 1920s, the cowboy image changed again. Now, a cowboy became the great white knight  that loved his horse more than the beautiful ladies he rescued. As the cowboy of the \"Old West\" spent more time with his horse than the ladies, this era's image was not entirely false. Then, in the 50s,Hollywood began producing so-called \"spaghetti westerns \".They earned the nickname because Italian companies financed the films and TV shows. This started the decade's \"Cowboy Craze\". While this didn't last long, it made modern country / western music, fashion and dance extremely popular.

{"answer": 3, "choices": ["gestures", "words", "smiles", "all above"], "question": "We use both words and body language to express our thoughts and opinions and to communicate with other people. We can learn about what a person is thinking by watching his or her body language. Words are important, but the way a person stands, folds his or her arms, or moves his or her hands can also give us information about his or her feelings. Just like spoken language, body language varies from culture to culture. Making eye contact --looking directly into someone's eyes -- is in some countries a way to show interest. In other countries, however, eye contact is rude or disrespectful. The gesture for Ok, making a circle with one's thumb and index finger, has different meanings in different cultures. In Japan, someone who sees another person making the gesture will think it means money. In France, a person seeing the same gesture will think it means zero. In Brazil and Germany, however, the gesture is rude. The thumbs-up gesture, meaning \"great\" or \"good job\" in the US is rude in Nigeria, but in Germany and Japan it means the number one. The \"crazy\" gesture, moving the index finger in a circle in front of the ear, means \"you have a phone call\" in Brazil. Even the gesture we use for \"yes\" and \"no\" are different around the world. In many countries, shaking one's head means \"no\", and nodding means \"yes\". In Bulgaria, parts of Greece, and Iran, however, the gestures have the opposite meaning. There are also differences as to how often we touch each other, how close we stand to someone we are talking to, and how we act when we meet or part. In some countries, for example, France and Russia, a visiting friend is greeted with a kiss on the check, in other countries people greet each other with a firm handshake, a loving hug, a bow or a simply a nod of the head. While there are many different interpretations of our body language, some gestures seem to be universal. Pressing one's palms together and resting one's head on the back of one's hand while closing the eyes as if sleeping means \"I am tired.\" A good way of saying \"I am full\" is moving the hand in circles over the stomach after a meal. If a person pats his or her stomach before a meal, it usually means \" I'm hungry.\" Perhaps the best example of universally understood body language is the smile. A smile can help us get through difficult situation and find friends in a world of strangers. A smile can open doors and tear down walls. It can be used to express almost any emotion.

The report notes higher rates of graduation -- over 70% --in areas surrounding the cities. Researchers studied high school graduation rates from the 2003, 2004 school year. They also identified the nation's fifty largest cities. The largest, New York City, had a population of more than eight million. The smallest city was Wichita, Kansas. It had about three hundred and sixty thousand people. Researchers used a system of measurement called the cumulative promotion index to find graduation rates. School officials in many of the cities studied said the resulting numbers were too low. That is because different areas use different methods to find graduation rates. Critics say many methods do not give a true _ of the number of students who leave high school before finishing. Other studies have put the national graduation rate at about 70%. But experts agree that too many students are not completing high school. They estimate the number at more than one million each year. The report was prepared for America's Promise Alliance. The private group aims to help children receive services they need to succeed. General Colin Powell was chairman of America's Promise Alliance when it was formed in 1997. He attended the press conference Tuesday where the report was released. He said studies have shown that the US must do more to educate the leaders and work force of the future. Secretary of Education Margaret Spellings also spoke. She said the government will propose that states use the same methods when reporting graduation rates. Alliance officials also announced the start of a nationwide campaign to improve graduation rates. It is to include a series of meetings to be held in every state over the next two years. The meetings will bring together elected leaders, business owners, students, parents and education officials. They will develop plans to increase the number of Americans who finish high school.

After all, the common viewpoint is that those outgoing and sociable guys make great public speakers and excellent networkers and that those shy people are not. A survey conducted by USA Today referred to 65 percent of executives who believed shyness to be a barrier to leadership.

It is true that a smile means the same thing in any language.  So does laughter or crying.  Fear is another emotion  that is shown in much the same way all over the world.  In Chinese and in English literature, a phrase like \"he went pale and began to tremble\" suggests that the man is either very afraid or he has just got a very big shock. However, \"he opened his eyes wide\" is used to suggest anger in Chinese whereas in English it means surprise. In Chinese, surprise can be described in a phrase like \"they stretched out their tongues!\" \"Stretching out your tongue\" in English is an insulting(, )gesture or expresses strong dislike.

And the average score was the lowest passing mark-51 points out of a possible 80. Chicago drivers did best with an average of 53 points. Los Angeles drivers came next with 52 points.

The CBS TV \"National Drivers Test\" showed that many U.S. drivers have a lot to learn. Here's why: CBS picked 1,799 samples  to take the test in TV studios in New York, Philadelphia, Chicago, and Los Angeles. More than two out of five of the drivers failed the test. And the average score was the lowest passing mark-51 points out of a possible 80. Chicago drivers did best with an average of 53 points. Los Angeles drivers came next with 52 points. New York and Philadephia drivers tied  with 50 points-a failing score. Drivers with 50 points or less were rated  \"poorly informed\" by the judges. Here are some of the test results: (1) Are men better informed drivers than women?-Yes. Men averaged 52 points. Women got average of 49. (2) Are older drivers better informed than younger drivers?-No. Drivers under 26 averaged 52 points. Drivers from 27 to 45 averaged 51. Driver over 45 failed with 48 points on average. (3) Does education make a difference?-Yes. College graduates averaged 52 points. High school graduates averaged 50. Those without high school diplomas  got 48. And people who had taken driver education courses scored an average of 53 points-three more than those who hadn't. (4) Does driving experience make a difference?-Yes. Drivers with three or more years' experience averaged 51 points. Drivers with less experience averaged 49.

The 24-year-old waiter was so smart that I knew there had to be more to his story. It turns out that he won a regional yo-yo competition last year.

(2) If you are tall and handsome, you can run from any number of armed criminals, and every shot will miss you. Be warned, however, if your name card says \"henchman\"   and you are part of a group of plain-looking people trying to catch a handsome individual, a single shot will kill you. But don't be anxious: TV also delivers useful information for bad guys. All cars are inflammable   and have amazing shock absorbers that enable them to fly into the air and land without damage -- except police cars. TV even teaches us about TV. Whenever anyone turns on a TV, it shows a news flash about someone they know. They then turn the box off immediately after that news item.

These were the goals set out by the Shanghai Water Authority. With the city's population expected to increase only slightly and the economy to boom by 2020, Chen Yin, an official in the water authority, said Shanghai's water consumption will not increase from its present amount. Zhang Yue, director of the Urban Construction Division under the Ministry of Construction, said, \"Shanghai is the first city in the country to publicize these ambitions. They will not be easy to achieve.\" He said water saving will help keep the sustainable development of China's economy. Saving one cubic meter of water means saving the city's infrastructure costs by 10,000 Yuan.

My husband went out to do something, and when he opened the door there was a great flutter on the ground and something came into the living room. It was clear that whatever it was was hurt. I was in a bit of a shock and didn't know what to do next. Fortunately it calmed down and tried to hide itself in a corner. I realized it was a sparrow chick . There are a few sparrow nests under the roof of our apartment, and this little fellow must have fallen out and hurt itself. It was also very young, and obviously far from ready to leave the safety of the nest. I ran to the place and found a box. Having read somewhere that one shouldn't touch a baby bird with one's hands, I picked the chick up with a hand towel and put it in the box. I placed the box outside the front door in the hope that the parents would try to feed it. They never came near it and I brought it inside. I placed the box on a table and it slept for about twenty hours. We later learned that it is quite normal for a hurt bird to sleep so much after undergoing such a hurt experience. When it finally woke up we carefully examined it for wounds, but fortunately there wasn't any. It had hurt its right wing and leg, which meant it must have landed on its right side when it fell out of the nest. We named it Lopsy. After doing some research we felt there was a chance that it might survive, but we weren't sure that it would ever be able to fly. A hurt bird doesn't stand much of a chance of survival and could fall easy pray  to cats, other animals. Was it fair to allow it to live if it meant keeping it in a cage its whole life? It was a hard decision, but we decided to give it a go.  We started off by dripping drops of water into its mouth. It was very thirsty and drank quite a bit. Next we fed it with bread soaked in water. Our household routine  soon revolved around Lopsy who needed to be fed about every three hours during the day. Fortunately we live on campus and my husband could come home during his breaks to feed our new baby. Soon Lopsy was growing nicely. The bigger it got, the more vocal  it became. There was no doubt as to who was ruling the house.  We remained concerned because its leg did not heal, and its wing seemed quite useless. I took it outside for exercise every day. I also hoped it would get used to the sights and sounds of nature. In the beginning all it was interested in was staying as close to me as possible. Anyway, it got stronger and started running on the grass, and one day Lopsy found a fence it liked. It got to the point where I would leave it outside under its fence for about two hours at a time while I kept an eye on developments from our kitchen window. Soon Lopsy figured out how to get from one branch to another.[:   ] It also got to the point where it could flutter down from my hand to the ground, and I let it do this over and over again to exercise its wings. Then came the day that it actually flew into the fence. We were overjoyed when this happened. Finally it got to the point where I left it outside in its fence all day and night, but I would still go outside to feed it. Lopsy remained vocal and would jumped over for its food as soon as I came into view. I left some bread on the wall next to its fence, but it would have none of it. The little fellow was totally spoilt and wanted to be spoon fed, but I saw him eating quite happily as soon as I left his line of vision.

{"answer": 2, "choices": ["Well begun is half done.", "Work makes the workman.", "Where there is life, there is hope.", "It is the first step that costs troublesome."], "question": "Little Lopsy fluttered  into our home and our hearts one Saturday morning this summer. My husband went out to do something, and when he opened the door there was a great flutter on the ground and something came into the living room. It was clear that whatever it was was hurt. I was in a bit of a shock and didn't know what to do next. Fortunately it calmed down and tried to hide itself in a corner. I realized it was a sparrow chick . There are a few sparrow nests under the roof of our apartment, and this little fellow must have fallen out and hurt itself. It was also very young, and obviously far from ready to leave the safety of the nest. I ran to the place and found a box. Having read somewhere that one shouldn't touch a baby bird with one's hands, I picked the chick up with a hand towel and put it in the box. I placed the box outside the front door in the hope that the parents would try to feed it. They never came near it and I brought it inside. I placed the box on a table and it slept for about twenty hours. We later learned that it is quite normal for a hurt bird to sleep so much after undergoing such a hurt experience. When it finally woke up we carefully examined it for wounds, but fortunately there wasn't any. It had hurt its right wing and leg, which meant it must have landed on its right side when it fell out of the nest. We named it Lopsy. After doing some research we felt there was a chance that it might survive, but we weren't sure that it would ever be able to fly. A hurt bird doesn't stand much of a chance of survival and could fall easy pray  to cats, other animals. Was it fair to allow it to live if it meant keeping it in a cage its whole life? It was a hard decision, but we decided to give it a go.  We started off by dripping drops of water into its mouth. It was very thirsty and drank quite a bit. Next we fed it with bread soaked in water. Our household routine  soon revolved around Lopsy who needed to be fed about every three hours during the day. Fortunately we live on campus and my husband could come home during his breaks to feed our new baby. Soon Lopsy was growing nicely. The bigger it got, the more vocal  it became. There was no doubt as to who was ruling the house.  We remained concerned because its leg did not heal, and its wing seemed quite useless. I took it outside for exercise every day. I also hoped it would get used to the sights and sounds of nature. In the beginning all it was interested in was staying as close to me as possible.

{"answer": 1, "choices": ["its light body", "its springy system", "its living environment", "the length of its jaw"], "question": "Which animal has the fastest snapping jaw  ? If you're guessing a shark or perhaps a larger animal, you'll have to think smaller. The trapjaw ant, which lives in Central and South America, moves its mouth parts at 35 to 63 meters per second. Another way to think about this is that the ant's jaws close at 125 to 233 kilometers per hour. That's 2, 300 times faster than the blink of an eye. Scientists were able to measure the amazing jaw speed using highspeed video techniques. Sheila Patek, a biologist, says the key is that the jaws have a springy   system, which is critical in getting explosive   speeds. Consider a bow and arrow. If you try to throw an arrow with your arm, it won't go very far. If you use a bow, elastic energy stored in the bow is released almost instantly when you release the arrow with your finger or a latch. The combination of the springy bow and latch mechanism is what makes the arrow zoom through the air. Maybe even more amazing than how fast these ants grab food or even enemies is how they use this same energy to move. As the ant closes its jaws, it uses them to push off the ground--all faster than the eye can see without slow motion video. A snap of the jaw can send an ant up to 8.3 centimeters into the air. That's like someone who is 1.7 meters jumping 13 meters high! Not only can they quickly escape from enemies, but often a group of ants will start jumping all at once. It would be hard for their enemies to grab just one. People have suspected the ants used their jaws to jump for over a century, but could only prove it with today's modern video equipment.

{"answer": 1, "choices": ["Their income and savings.", "Their house, cars and small amounts of savings.", "Everything they own in their homes.", "Actually, they have no wealth at all."], "question": "Most Americans get what money they have from their work; that is, they earn an income from wages or salaries. The richest Americans, however, get most of their money from what they own -- their stocks, bonds, real estate, and other forms of property, or wealth. Although there are few accurate statistics to go by, wealth in American society appears to be concentrated in very few hands. More than 20 percent of everything that can be privately owned is held by less than one percent of the adult population and more than 75 percent of all wealth is owned by 20 percent of American adults. The plain fact is that most Americans have no wealth at all aside from their homes, automobiles, and a small amount of savings. Income in the United States is not as highly concentrated as wealth. In 1917 the richest 10 percent of American families received 26.1 percent of all income, while the poorest 10 percent received 17 percent, mainly from Social Security and other government payments. The most striking aspect of income distribution is that it has not changed significantly since the end of World War II. Although economic growth has roughly doubled real disposable   family income (the money left after taxes and adjusted for inflation) over the last generation, the size of the shares given to the rich and the poor is about the same. By any measure economic inequality is great in the United States. The reality behind these statistics is that a large number of Americans are poor. In 1918, 14 percent of the population was living below the federal government's poverty line, which at that time was an annual income of $ 9 287 for a nonfarm family of two adults and two children. In other words, about one out of seven Americans over 31 million people was officially considered unable to buy the basic necessities of food, clothes, and shelter. The suggested poverty line in 1981 would have been an income of about $11, 200 for a family of four.

It was not until the eighteenth and nineteenth centuries that English painters put back watercolor as a serious art form. The English have a widely-known love for the outdoors and also small, private pictures. The softness of watercolor had a remarkably strong attraction for them.

In March we published a photo story about the extraordinary Zsnskar region in northern India,which is cut off from the outside world for more than seven months of the year,and only accessible  via a frozen river.We also included information about the limited use of skiing in the region and the recent creation of the Zanskar Ski School: \"Despite the difficulties of travelling through the region when the snow comes,skiing hasn't traditionally been used as a means of transport by the locals,largely because trees don't grow here, so there is little in the way of raw materials from which to make skis.In 1995, a group of British scientists in the region noticed the lack of skis and one of them returned to set up the Zanskar Ski School in Padam.The school provides lessons for a small fee and rents skis to the local people. Among the benefits that the school hopes to bring are improved education--children often find it difficult to get to school through the deep snow--and the possibility of offering ski tours to tourists in the future.So far,more than 300 local people have received training,and local doctors and policemen regularly borrow skis.\" But what we weren't able to include in the article is that the ski school is always on the look out for old skiing equipment--particularly of a size suitable for children--and, I thought. Now the European ski season is drawing to a close,there might be a few of you out there who have some old equipment you'd like to see go to a good home.If that's the ease you can get in touch with the school via their website www.zanskarski school.org.

A Method To His Madness? The loose, disjointed style of the story involved both the 1950s version of the O'Brien family as well as the present-day version of their oldest son Young Jack. There are no solid beginning-middle-ends in any scene; they play out more like a merory or a dream does in your head. Therefore, the audience is left with less of a definitive statement about what's going on, and more of an emotional connection to what they see on screen.

Kids knew not to go into his yard to pick a delicious apple, even off the ground, because old Dawson, they said, would come after you with his ball bullet gun.

They had to walk by Dawson's house on the way to Amy's house, but as they got close Janet saw him sitting on his front porch and suggested they cross over to the other side of the street.

The closer we got to the turnoff for my grandparents' house, the slower the car went. Suddenly, my father U-turned in the middle of the road and said, ''I can't stand it!\" ''What?\" asked my mother. ''They've got children. It's Christmas. I can't stand _ .\" When my father pulled into the service station, I saw that there were five of them: the parents and three children--two girls and a small boy. My father rolled down his window. \"Merry Christmas,\" he said. \"Howdy ,''the man replied. ''You are waiting for the bus?'' my father asked. The man said that they were. They were going to Birmingham, where he had a brother and prospects of a job.     \"Well, that bus isn't going to come along for several hours, and you're getting wet standing here. Winborn is just a couple miles up the road. They've got a shed with a cover there and some benches\". My father said. ''Why don't you all get in the car and I'll run you up there.\"     The man thought about it for a moment, and then he beckoned to his family. They climbed into the car. They had no luggage, only the clothes they were wearing.     Once they settled in, my father looked back over his shoulder and asked the children if Santa had found them yet. Three gloomy faces gave him his answer.     \"Well I didn't think so,\" my father said, winking at my mother,\"because when I saw Santa this morning, he told me that he was having trouble finding all, and he asked me if he could leave your toys at my house. We'll just go to get them before I take you to the bus stop.\"     All at once, the three children's faces lit up, and they began to bounce around in the back seat, laughing and chattering.     When we got out of the car at our house, the three children ran through the front door and straight to the toys that were spread out under our Christmas tree. One of the girls spied Jill's doll and immediately hugged it to her breast. I remember that the little boy grabbed Sharon's ball. And the other girl picked up something of mine.

She led a survey of 2,326 parents who have children 8 and younger.It found that in 80 percent of families, children's media use was not a problem, with 55 percent \"not too\" or\" not at all\"  concerned about it. It also showed parents have more positive than negative feelings about how media consumption affects a child's learning and the development of creativity.The exception is video games, which are viewed more negatively than TV, computers or mobile devices.\"Parents rated video games as more likely to have a negative effect on children's school performance, attention time, creativity, social skills, behavior and sleep than any other medium,\" the researchers said in a news conference about the survey.  The findings exposes a generational shift   in parental attitudes about technology's role in young children's lives,\" said Wartella.\"Today's parents grew up with technology as a central pact of their lives, so they think about it differently than earlier generations of parents, instead of a battle with kids on one side and parents on the other, the use of media and technology has become a family affair. \" The researchers identified three media environments created by parents: media-centric (39 percent of families) , media-moderate (45%)and media-light (16%). Children  in media-centric families spend at least three hours more each day watching TV or using computers, video games and tablet PCs don't make parenting easier.And 88 percent of parents say they are most likely to turn to toys or activities to keep their children occupied.Slightly fewer turn to books (79%) and TV(78%). The survey didn't look at how media affects children. That's a topic that the American Academy of Pediatrics has handled a number of times. The AAP says studies have found too much media use can lead to attention- problems, school difficulties, sleep and eating disorders and being fat. In addition, the Internet and cell phones can provide platforms for illegal and risky behaviors. By limiting screen time and offering educational media and non-electronic formats  such as books, newspapers and board games, and watching television with their children, parents can help guide their children's media experience.

It is important for kids to spend time on outdoor play, reading, hobbies  and  using their imaginations  in free  play.\" Kids  under 2 should not use television and other entertainment media because their brains are developing quickly and they learn best from direct human interaction,\" the group says.

After her morning exercises and some housework, she drives to the local hospital, where she volunteers once a week. What makes Parker's routine so extraordinary is that she is 104 years old. \"I don't know why I'm still here,\" she said. Dr. Thomas Perls of the Boston University Medical Center is trying to figure that out. As the director of the New England Centenarian   Study, he studies there \"super humans\", those age 100 years and older. \"It's like winning the lottery\", he said. \"You've got to choose the right numbers and the right combination.\" Researchers believe about 30 percent of aging is genetic. For those who get to extremely old ages, family history may play an even more important role. Reuben Landau's mother lived to 100, and three of his brothers and sisters into their 90s. Landau is nearly 102, and he still practices law a few hours every day. Both Landau and Parker are remarkably healthy. They take few medications and have no major illness. Perls has found that many centenarians lack a type of gene -- E4 -- that is associated with an increased risk of heart disease. One study found the gene is in 29 percent of young men, but only 15 percent of centenarians. Perls also believes they may have a \"protective gene\", one that helps them survive what might kill others. Parker, for example, smoked until she was 100 and had a stroke at 89. However, living into your 100s isn't just genetics. Aging successfully has much to do with environment and behavior. Landau watches what he eats and exercises his body and mind every day. He's convinced it's why he's still in good health. \"People still have to do the right things to get to very old age,\" said Perls. So it's not just the cards you're dealt, but how you play the hand.

A study by Professor Semir Zeki of University College London has found that love does affect people's brains by making them feel great. Zeki studied young men and women who had recently fallen in love. He found that, when they were looking at photos of their loved ones, there was heightened activity in four areas of their brains. These areas deal with emotions, and one of them, in particular, is known to respond to drugs that cause feelings of great joy and excitement. Interestingly, the study also found a lack of activity in two other areas of the brain when the volunteers looked at their lovers' photographs. One of these areas is linked to feelings of sadness, while the other is often active in people suffering from depression. It seems love really can be _ . The state of being in love, according to some scientists, may actually be good for your health. Although scientists know that being in love can make a person feel great, the exact influence of love on a person's health is harder to determine. However, scientists say that people do need love in order to live healthy lives. According to Dr. Thomas Lewis, people need to be in relationships because that is how we are designed. He says the brain can only maintain  the overall stability of a person's immune  system, bodily rhythms, and heart if it receives input  from outside the body in the form of emotional connections with others. Professor Antonio Damasio has a similar view. He says that love enriches a person's imagination and creativity, and makes a person's body work better. He also believes that love can even improve the body's ability to fight against disease. Damasio's wise words of advice are \" Choose love and you will live longer.\" Which of the following statements is not true?", "subject": ""}

He is very brave and always helps others in need. On March 26, 2012, Zhang donated bone marrow   at the Navy General Hospital of Beijing. He is the youngest and the first high school student to do it. Last April, Zhang became a blood donor on his 18th birthday. He also joined the China Marrow Donor Program that day. Six months later, his bone marrow was chosen as a match for a 4-year-old leukemia   patient from Fujian. Zhang was studying for the National College Entrance Examination (NCEE) when the call from the Chinese Bone Marrow Donors came. He found out that the patient could not wait, or things might get worse. With the support of his family and school, Zhang arrived at the hospital in Beijing the very next day. \"Saving a life is more important than taking an exam, and having the chance to help cure a patient does not allow for more thought,\" Zhang said. The transplant operation   was a success. After that, Zhang Wenchi was in good health and he came back to school soon. Zhang said then the most important task for him was the exam. He hoped that his dream of becoming a pilot could come true. Now the NCEE has been over for more than a month, and what about Zhang Wenchi's marks? To our great relief, it's known that he has earned 540 points, which means he can be admitted into Beihang University (formerly Beijing University of Aeronautics & Astronautics). Therefore he can realize his dream of flying in the sky. Zhang's deed has earned him nationwide respect, and some have given him the nickname, \"the most beautiful post-90s student\".

Instead, they are encouraged and sometimes required to be involved in the local communities they are studying in. \"It's  ly important that they know something about how people in other parts of the world live and think, and how they behave,\" says William Finlay, head of the sociology department at the University of Georgia. In 2008, he co-founded a study abroad program with South Africa's Stellenbosch University. It combines traditional academic in-class learning with community involvement. \"We've been working with a non-government organization in the township. Our students typically either work with little children in day care centers or work in the library and teach very basic computer skills to young children,\" says Finlay. The three-week program proved to be an unforgettable experience for Hillary Kinsey. She says, \"It was interesting to learn the history of the area and then talk to these people and see what the social dynamics were, and how certain groups felt about other groups.\" When Hillary Kinsey returned home from South Africa, she and other students in the program established a non-profit group. Kinsey says the group wants to contribute to advancing education and development in South Africa. \"One of the purposes of the group is that we hope to raise money and awareness about the situation where those people live and help to promote any sort of educational development that we can, \" Kinsey added.

Different creatures have developed some pretty creative ways to get their rest and stay safe. The lizard likes to sleep at the far end of small branches hanging out over a pond or lake in the rain forest. If a snake tries to slither up the branch to eat it, it will shake the branch and knock the lizard off, and the lizard will fall safely into the water. Chameleons can change color to match their surroundings in order to hide even while sleeping. Gorillas like to sleep high in the trees. They build a new bed every night, sometimes taking up to half an hour to pile branches, twigs, and leaves into a comfortable bed. Birds also find it safe to sleep in the trees, but unless they have eggs or young chicks, they don't use a nest. They just lock their feet around a branch and hang on. A special tendon in their legs is automatically tight when they are at rest, so they won't let go and fall. Dolphins live underwater, but must come to the surface to breathe. Scientists now believe that dolphins may sleep with only half their brain, while the other half stays awake to keep them safe and breathing. Seals also do this, lying on their sides on the surface of the water with one flipper underwater paddling to keep their noses above the surface. Some ducks may also have this ability, and actually sleep with one eye closed and one eye open. How does a chameleon protect itself while sleeping?", "subject": ""}

The Olympics will need around 70,000 volunteers and the Paralympic Games  will need another 30,000. University students like Xue will make up the majority of the volunteers. But the Olympics also need other volunteers - ordinary citizens and foreigners, for example. Students in Beijing should apply through their universities. Other volunteers may apply online or submit a written application. The online application system and a hotline will be open next Monday. For applicants outside Beijing, the application process begins in December. There is plenty of work for volunteers to do. For example, there will be chances to help publicize the games over the next two years. During the games themselves, volunteers will clean, serve food, marshal or offer language help. The Sydney Olympics in 2000 was the first that placed special emphasis on the role of volunteers. It used more than 45,000 volunteers in different roles. In the 2004 Athens Olympics, around 45,000 volunteers were used. More than 70,000 volunteers will be needed for the Olympic games and Paralympic Games in 2012, the London Olympic Organizing Committee has said. The passage mainly tells us  _  .", "subject": ""}

Some people think that life in the cities is going to be horrible. They say that cities will become more and more crowded. As the number of people increases, there will be less space for each person. This overcrowding will cause other problems -- more crime, dirtier streets , and worse problems with traffic than we have now. How will people find enough drinking water, energy (such as gas and electricity ), and housing? Because life will be hard, people who live in cities will worry more, and they may become sick. For these reasons, some say that nobody will want to live in city areas. How can we deal with such problems as overcrowding, crime, and traffic? In some cities, thousands of people are already sleeping in the streets because there is little suitable housing -- and because houses are too expensive. The crime rate isn't going down. Instead, it is increasing so fast that many people are afraid to go out at night. Traffic is also getting worse. More and more often, traffic jams are so bad that cars don't move at all for several streets.

Instead, many commuters (, ) drive many miles from their homes to work. Many of these drivers spend several hours each day on busy freeways.

Dentists say it is important to find soft toothbrushes made especially for babies and to use them very gently. The use of fluoride  to protect teeth is common in many parts of the world. For example, it is often added to drinking water supplies. The fluoride mixes with enamel , the hard surface on teeth, to help prevent holes from forming.

Draftsmen make up the largest group of the architectural offices' work force. Because of the wide range of duties they perform, draftsmen are sometimes called architectural technicians. In a typical office, there are not only career draftsmen but also architectural graduates working as junior draftsmen to learn the trade.

For example, too many tourists can crowd public places that are also enjoyed by the inhabitants of a country. If tourists create too much traffic, the inhabitants become annoyed and unhappy. They begin to dislike tourists and to treat them impolitely. They forget how much tourism can help the country's economy. It is important to think about the people of a destination country and how tourism affects them. Tourism should help a country, keep the customs and beauty that attract tourists. Tourism should also advance the wealth and happiness of local inhabitants. Too much tourism can be a problem. If tourism grows too quickly, people must leave other jobs to work in the tourism industry. This means that other parts of the country's economy can suffer. On the other hand, if there is not enough tourism, people can lose jobs. Businesses can also lose money. It costs a great deal of money to build large hotels, airports, air terminals, first- class roads, and other support facilities needed by tourist attractions. For example, a major international class tourism hotel can cost as much as 50 thousand dollars per room to build. If this room is not used most of the time, the owners of the hotel lose money. Building a hotel is just a beginning. There must be many support facilities as well, including roads to get to the hotel, electricity, sewers to handle waste, and water.

Visitors can still watch the process take place on the largest island, which like the state is named Hawaii. People usually just call it the Big Island. Experts say Polynesian people first sailed to Hawaii about 2,000 years ago. A king ruled the islands when the 18th century British explorer James Cook arrived. At first, Hawaiians treated Captain Cook like a god. But in the end, he was killed on the Big Island in 1779. Britain gave the islands their independence in 1843. Then, fifty years later, a group of American businessmen ousted the ruler and founded the Republic of Hawaii. It became an American territory in 1900.

Now the National Transportation Safety Board (NTSB) is calling for \"controlled naps\" during nightshifts  . NTSB member Mark Rosekind said that a 26-minute nap would improve performance by 34%. He believes that beyond the aviation   industry, other professions, such as motoring and machinery, also carry obvious risks. But other experts doubt whether 26 minutes is the appropriate napping time. It's a bit too long and risks you falling into a deep sleep, says Jim Horne, director of the Sleep Research Council. He said, \"A nap of about 15 minutes is best; once you get beyond 20 minutes, you risk a deep sleep and you can be much more tired when you wake up. Therefore, we suggest that a nap be combined with a cup of coffee so that you can enjoy an effective sleep before the caffeine   takes effect in 20 minutes. However, this method only works on those who have had a poor night's sleep. If you haven't had a sleep the night before, this method won't be enough to make you fresh.\"  Health writer, Linda Wasmer Andrews, also believes that 26 minutes is too long.

The authors estimate that without government intervention, the total number of deaths could double by 2050. The study, published in the journal Nature, identifies particulate matter  as the prime pollutant leading to premature mortality. Particulate matter, a substance formed as a combination of different materials released into the air, is thought to be harmful to human health once it exceeds 2.5 micrometers in diameter. Researchers also identified ozone as a contributor to dangerous air quality. The causes of air pollution vary dramatically from place to place. In India and China, the study says, emissions from residential heating and cooking drive air pollution by creating unhealthy quantities of smoke. Overall, residential heating emissions cause one third of air pollution-related deaths worldwide. In highly regulated areas, like the United States, Europe and Japan, emissions from agriculture tend to be primary contributors to air pollution. Fertilizer used in agriculture releases ammonia into the atmosphere, a process that creates harmful particulate matter. Globally, air pollution from agriculture kills more than 600,000 people annually, the study finds. The findings are consistent with a 2014 report from the World Health Organization that suggested that 7 million deaths occur annually due to both indoor and outdoor air pollution. The study's conclusions give a sense of urgency to efforts to reduce air pollution but present challenges because of difficulty regulating heating activity in people's homes, according to study author Jos Lelieveld. People who live in the most affected areas should be provided with information about less toxic heating methods, he said. \"It's important to reduce emissions from residential energy use,\" Lelieveld said on a conference call for journalists. \"You can't ask people to stop eating and cooking, but you can provide better technologies.\" Air pollution contributes to a variety of ailments that eventually lead to premature mortality like lung cancer, stroke and heart failure, according to the study. Another study published this week in the journal Environmental Health Perspectives reached similar conclusions showing the devastating   effects of pollution on individual health. Researchers found that chronic exposure to particulate matter increases the chance of early death by 3%. That risk is especially high for heart disease; the chance a person will die of heart disease increases by around 10% with chronic exposure to particulate matter. Researchers found that the number of deaths is expected to double by 2050 without new government policies. Nearly all of the increase will occur in Asia, according to the report.

Mental health experts claim that exercise is a solution to those feeling mild or moderate depression . However , for those severely depressed , simply doing sports is not enough . Use school counseling services : Campuses don't employ mental health experts simply to throw thousands of dollars down the drain . Their job is to help students , so experts recommend you use them . Most students , however , are hesitant to take a trip to their college's counseling center , fearing being laughed at by peers . As a result , some schools like Texas Christian University , are testing students for mental health problems when they get sick and visit the campus health clinic . Take advantage of technology : Staying in touch with family members and friends from childhood and high school has become easier than ever with the coming of Facebook and video chat services like Skype . While mental health experts insist that it's important to make friends in your new environment and be involved in the college community , it's also significant to keep in touch with the people you knew before college . Go to sleep : Following a fairly regular sleep pattern can defend you against depression . In college , many students' sleep patterns are irregular thanks to late-night studying and partying , which is harmful to their mental health . Research strongly suggests that sleep is the key to learning and memory formation . which of the following can NOT help one reduce depression?", "subject": ""}

{"answer": 1, "choices": ["They are deaf to noises.", "Noises at a certain level may hurt them.", "They are easily confused by noises.", "Noises will limit their ability to reproduce."], "question": "Some scientists say that animals in the ocean are increasingly threatened by noise pollution caused by human beings. The noise that affects sea creatures comes from a number of human activities. It is caused mainly by industrial underwater explosions, ocean drilling, and ship engines. Such noises are added to natural sounds. These sounds include the breaking of ice fields, underwater earthquakes, and sounds made by animals themselves. Decibels  measured in water are different from those measured on land. A noise of 120 decibels on land causes pain to human ears. In water, a decible level of 195 would have the same effect. Some scientists have suggested setting a noise limit of 120 decibles in oceans. They have observed that noises above that level can frighten and confuse whales. A team of American and Canadian scientists discovered that loud noises could seriously injure some animals. The research team found that powerful underwater explosions were causing whales in the area to lose their hearing, which seriously affected the whales' ability to exchange information and find their way.

The youth of today are even more looking forward to Apple Corp's products.    The iPad is an Apple tablet computer. The device sits somewhere between a laptop and a smart phone, according to Apple's chief executive, Steven P.

The iPad went on sale on April 3, 2010, and Apple said it had shipped 500,000 units in the first week. The handheld device puts Apple on a direct collision course with the Kindle from Amazon, which Mr. Jobs ever considered as pioneering the category.    It is common knowledge that media companies hope the iPad will finally lead to available ways for them to charge for news, books and other materials. The half-inch thick, 1.5-pound device features a 9.7-inch multi-touch screen and is powered by a customized Apple microchip, which is called A4.

The telescopes were partly made possible by a gift of twenty-five million dollars from Paul Allen. The total cost of the project is already fifty million dollars. At present, there are 42 radio telescopes working at the Hat Creek observatory. The signals they receive are combined to create what is equal to a single, very large telescope. The telescope will be used to observe objects like exploding stars, black holes and other objects that are predicted but have not yet been observed. Seth Shostak of the SETI Institute says this is the first telescope whose main purpose is to search for signals from intelligent life in space. The SETI Institute is based in Mountain View, California. The organization supports the search for other life forms in the universe. What makes the Allen Telescope Array unusual is that it can collect and study information from a wide area of the sky. In addition, the 42 telescopes can study information about several projects at the same time. That means studies of large areas of the sky can be made faster than ever before. Some officials think the Allen Telescope Array will be completed in three more years. 350 individual radio telescopes are planned. The new abilities of the Allen Telescope Array will make searching for stars similar to the sun much faster. An earlier search by SETI, Project Phoenix, studied about 800 stars to a distance of 240 light years. The project ended in 2004.

The telescope will be used to observe objects like exploding stars, black holes and other objects that are predicted but have not yet been observed.

Forget about placing an order, paying the bill online and waiting for days for it to be delivered to you. In the near future, you'll be able to get it in minutes just by hitting \"print\" on your computer. You might find it hard to believe that you could actually \"print\" an object like you would a picture. But it is not that hard to understand how it would work. Just as a traditional printer sprays ink onto paper line by line, modern 3D printers spread material onto a surface layer by layer, from the bottom to the top, gradually building up a shape. Instead of ink, the materials the 3D printer uses are mainly plastic, resin and certain metals. The thinner each layer is--from a millimetre to less than the width of a hair--the smoother and finer the object will be. This may sound like a completely new technology, but the truth is that 3D printing has been around since the late 1980s. Back then, it was barely affordable for most people, so few knew about it. Last year, though, saw a big change in the 3D printing industry--printers became much cheaper. For example, 10 years ago a desktop 3D printer might have cost PS20,000, while now they cost only about PS1,000, according to the BBC. Taken out of the factory and introduced to more diverse and common uses, 3D printing can create just about anything you can think of--flutes , bikinis, jewelry, aircraft parts and even human organs. In fact, scientists from Cornell University in New York have just made an artificial ear using a 3D printer, according to Science Daily. The fake ear looks and acts exactly like a natural one. However, as 3D printing becomes more common, it may bring about certain problems--such as piracy. \"Once you can download a coffee maker, or print out a new set of kitchen utensils on your personal 3D printer, who will visit a retail store again?\" an expert in 3D printing told Forbes News.

In the near future, you'll be able to get it in minutes just by hitting \"print\" on your computer. You might find it hard to believe that you could actually \"print\" an object like you would a picture. But it is not that hard to understand how it would work. Just as a traditional printer sprays ink onto paper line by line, modern 3D printers spread material onto a surface layer by layer, from the bottom to the top, gradually building up a shape. Instead of ink, the materials the 3D printer uses are mainly plastic, resin and certain metals. The thinner each layer is--from a millimetre to less than the width of a hair--the smoother and finer the object will be. This may sound like a completely new technology, but the truth is that 3D printing has been around since the late 1980s. Back then, it was barely affordable for most people, so few knew about it. Last year, though, saw a big change in the 3D printing industry--printers became much cheaper. For example, 10 years ago a desktop 3D printer might have cost PS20,000, while now they cost only about PS1,000, according to the BBC. Taken out of the factory and introduced to more diverse and common uses, 3D printing can create just about anything you can think of--flutes , bikinis, jewelry, aircraft parts and even human organs. In fact, scientists from Cornell University in New York have just made an artificial ear using a 3D printer, according to Science Daily. The fake ear looks and acts exactly like a natural one. However, as 3D printing becomes more common, it may bring about certain problems--such as piracy. \"Once you can download a coffee maker, or print out a new set of kitchen utensils on your personal 3D printer, who will visit a retail store again?\" an expert in 3D printing told Forbes News.

The high-end beans, such as Kona or Blue Mountain, are known to cost extraordinary sums of money. Then there is Kopi Lowak (translated as \"Civet Coffee\"), the world's most expensive coffee, which sells for as much as US $50 per quarter-pound. This isn't particularly surprising, because approximately 500 pounds a year of Kopi Lowak make up the entire world supply. What is surprising is why this particular coffee is so rare. In fact, it's not the plants that are rare. It's the civet droppings. That's right, the civet droppings--the body waste of the palm civet. Coffee beans aren't Kopi Lowak until they've been digested  and come out in the body waste of the palm civet. Palm civets are tree-dwelling, raccoon-like little animals, native to Southeast Asia and the Indonesian islands. They also have a love for coffee cherries. According to Kopi Lowak suppliers, palm civets eat the fruit whole, but only digest the outer fruit, leaving the beans intact . While the beans are not destroyed, they undergo a transformation in the animal's body. A chemical substance in the digestive system of the palm civet causes some changes to the beans to give them a unique flavor . However, this is not the only explanation why coffee beans retrieved from civet droppings have a special flavor all their own. Another possible reason is that palm civets have an unfailing instinct for picking the coffee cherries at the peak of their ripeness. Kopi Lowak is reported to have a character in taste unlike any other coffee, complex with caramel undertones and an earthy flavor.

{"answer": 2, "choices": ["It provides owners good company.", "It makes it convenient to look after them.", "It helps the air around them slightly wet.", "It allows owners to draw a pleasant picture."], "question": "As with any house guests, indoor plants require a certain amount of basic, regular attention if they are going to feel at home. The first consideration when purchasing plants is to make reasonably sure that they are suitable for the condition in which they are going to be housed. A general rule for most plants being brought indoors for the first time is to ensure that they have reasonable temperature of not less than 60 degrees Fahrenheit, a position out of cold air, safe from pets and not exposed to strong sunlight. Plants love company. When plants are growing together, they create an atmosphere of damp around themselves which is far more beneficial than hot dry conditions. A group of plants will also present a more pleasing picture and provide an opportunity for a creative arrangement. There is no secret to this. Just rely on your natural feeling for harmony. Watering and feeding plants are probably the two areas of care that are the least well understood, but, again, if you follow a few simple rules, your plants should do well. Cold slightly warm water is therefore the answer. It is usually better to pour water on to the soil on the surface of the pot rather than put the water into the pot holder at the bottom. Avoid giving small amount of water at regular intervals- it is much better to wet the soil right through the pot in one go and then to allow it to dry noticeably before giving it a further watering.

In the past,concern about a man-made warming of the earth has concentrated on the Arctic because the Antarctic is much colder and has a much thicker ice sheet.But the weather experts are now paying more attention to West Antarctic.which may be affected by only a few degrees of warming,in other words,by a warming on the scale that will possibly take place in the next fifty years from the burning of fuels.     Satellite pictures show that large areas of Antarctic ice are already disappearing.The evidence available suggests that a warming has taken place.This fits the theory that carbon dioxide warms the earth.

Rice farming promotes a holistic focus on distinguishing relationships among people and objects,and valuing others as much as or more than oneself, say psychologist Thomas Talhelm of the University of Virginia and his colleagues.Holistic thinking among many modem Chinese people partly reflects regional histories of building communal irrigation systems and cooperatively planting and harvesting rice fields over thousands of  years. They draw that conclusion based on studies of college students from regions with different agricultural practices.Students from southern and central China's rice.growing provinces think holistically, even though they have probably never farmed rice,Talhelm's group reports.In contrast,students from northern and central Chinese provinces that have specialized in wheat growing exhibit a preference for abstract analysis and self over others,the scientists find.Wheat is less labor-intensive to grow than rice,SO farmers can plant and harvest crops without much help from neighbors.Analytical,individualistic thinking is not more common among students from richer Provinces, contrary to the argument that this attitude springs from modernization. \"Rice theory might explain why East Asia is so much less individualistic than expected based on its wealth, \" Talhelm says. Talhelm,s team tested 1,162 Chinese students,who Viewed lists of three items,such as a rabbit,a dog and a carrot. For each list,students chose two items that belonged together. Earlier research found that analytical thinkers often group items according to categories,so rabbits and dogs go together.Holistic thinkers tend to 1ook for relationships,such as rabbits eating carrots. Students from rice-growing areas made an average of around seven to nine holistic matches of 10 possible matches,compared with roughly f1ve to seven holistic matches for those from Wheat-growing areas.

I had moved into a new rented house with my youngest son after my husband and I divorced. We'd been in the house just six weeks. I went to a dinner party one night, and as I drove home near, I saw smoke rising into the sky. I wondered whether it was my house. Then I turned the corner, and sure enough, it was my house. My son and I stayed with a friend for a couple of nights. Then my friend Gail heard about the fire, called me up, and said, \"Come and move into my house. I have seven bedrooms and five bathrooms - plenty of space for you and your son.\" Gail had three kids at home, but there was still plenty of room for me and my son, Sutton. Little did I know that her offer of a temporary place to stay would turn into a living arrangement that lasted two and a half years. We were two single mothers. Gail and I spent the next couple of years sorting out a lot of things together. After we moved in, I soon began to look for a permanent place to live in. Gail said, \"Please don't leave. I've never had so much freedom!\" Having me in the house meant someone to help take care of her kids, someone to share cooking and gardening, and someone to share day-to-day life. She loved having me there, and I loved being there. So we stayed. It was an important chapter in my life. We both needed time to heal from our divorces. It was a time of deeper insight and spiritual growth for both of us. Gail's generosity was more than anyone could expect from a friend. I am eternally grateful to have a friend like Gail.

{"answer": 2, "choices": ["It only traps the heat of the sun.", "It works the same way as greenhouse gases.", "It makes the earth neither too hot nor too cold.", "It prevents all the light from the sun shining on the earth."], "question": "Global warming is when the earth heats up,the temperature rises.It happens when greenhouse gases--carbon dioxide,water vapor,nitrous oxide  ,and methane   trap heat and light from the sun in the earth's atmosphere,which increases the temperature.This is like when heat is trapped in a car.On a very hot day,the car gets hotter when it is out in the parking lot.This is because the heat and light from the sun can get into the car,by going through the windows,but it can't get back out.Once the light is inside the car,it is trapped and the heat builds up,just like it does in the earth's atmosphere.This is what the greenhouse effect does to the earth.The heat and light can get through the atmosphere,but it can't get out.As a result,the temperature rises. Sometimes the temperature can change in a way that helps us.The greenhouse effect makes the earth appropriate for people to live on.Without _ ,the earth would be freezing,or on the other hand it would be burning hot.We would not get the sun's heat and light to make the night somewhat warm.During the day,especially during the summer,it would be burning because the sun would be up with no atmosphere to filter   it,so people,plants,and animals would be exposed to all the light and heat. Although the greenhouse effect makes the earth able to have people living on it,if there gets to be too many gases,the earth can get unusually warmer,and many plants,animals,and people will die.They would die because there would be less food (plants like corn,wheat,and other vegetables and fruits).This would happen because the plants would not be able to take in the heat.This would cause us to have less food to eat,but it would also limit the food that animals have.Gradually,people,plants,and animals would all die of hunger. People are doing many things to try to stop global warming.One thing people are doing is carpooling.Carpooling is driving with someone to a place that you are both going to.This minimizes the amount of greenhouse gases put into the air by a car. Another thing that people are doing is being more careful about leaving things turned on like the television,computer,and the lights.A lot of people are taking time away from the television,and instead,they are spending more time outdoors.This helps our planet out a lot.Now,more people are even riding buses,walking to school,and riding their bikes to lower the amount of greenhouse gases in the air. Planting trees and recycling also help.If you recycle,less trash goes to the dump,and less trash gets burned.As a result,there are fewer greenhouse gasses in our atmosphere.Although adults do many things to help stop global warming,kids can do just as much.

You spend an hour with them and feel as if you've known them half your life. These people have something in common. And once you know what it is, we can try to do it ourselves. How is it done? Here are several skills that good talkers have. If you follow the skills, they will help you to put people at their ease, and make friends with them quickly. First of all, good talkers have asked questions. Almost anyone, no matter how shy he is, will answer a question. One well-known businesswoman says, \"At business lunches, I always ask people what they did that morning. It's a common question, but it will get things going.\" From there you can move on to other matters ----sometimes to really personal questions. And how he answers will let you know how far you can go. Second, once good talkers have asked questions, they listen for the answers. This point seems clear, but it isn't. Your question should have a point and help to tell what sort of person you are talking to. And to find out, you really have to listen carefully and attentively. Real listening at least means some things. First it means not to change the subject of conversation. If someone sticks to one topic, you can take it as a fact that he is really interested in it.

However, I have got to say Stay With Me wasn't my favorite in this series, but I still really enjoyed it and I would absolutely recommend it to fans interested in the world of young adults. Stay With Me is the third book in Jennifer's Wait For You series, which features a couple that have been in previous books but have their own unique story and can be read as a standalone. I like that about this series. It's nice to be able to pick up a book and read it, finish it and move on to the next, but the Wait For You series has the added bonus of a more deeper character connection, as theyve appeared previously, you have more of a feel for them and you look forward to their story. Stay With Me is Calla and Jaxs story. Calla has a wreck  of a mother, but she is finally coming to the end of college and is looking forward to a career in nursing. She has done pretty well up for herself and now it was her time to shine. Unluckily, it falls through when her mother robbed her of every penny and took her identity. Calla has to go back to her small home town and into the arms of Jax. Jax is handsome and cheerful! He is a waiter in a bar and knows Calla's mother very well and he agrees to help Calla. He is true alpha, with a sweet side and is very protective of Calla. I loved him, but not as much as Cam, sorry Jax! And that's why Stay with Me isn't as good as Cam's book, Wait for You. Don't get me wrong. Jax is an incredibly great character, well fleshed out and I did care for him, but he just wasn't as lovely as Cam. As for Calla, I liked her character, and I liked the connection between her and Jax. I loved how he _ and showed her to love herself, despite her unsatisfactory past. There are a lot of intense moments between these two characters and they are so well written. Jennifer's writing is addictive and she wrote the scenes between Jax and Calla beautifully. Calla has never been, what she would call boyfriend material, and so she struggles to see what Jax sees in her and she bats him off and ignores it. There's a lot of push and pull between them, and it's very charming. At times I did get a little annoyed with Calla, especially with her insecurity but Jax soon made up for that!

She writes about young adults brilliantly. However, I have got to say Stay With Me wasn't my favorite in this series, but I still really enjoyed it and I would absolutely recommend it to fans interested in the world of young adults. Stay With Me is the third book in Jennifer's Wait For You series, which features a couple that have been in previous books but have their own unique story and can be read as a standalone. I like that about this series. It's nice to be able to pick up a book and read it, finish it and move on to the next, but the Wait For You series has the added bonus of a more deeper character connection, as theyve appeared previously, you have more of a feel for them and you look forward to their story. Stay With Me is Calla and Jaxs story. Calla has a wreck  of a mother, but she is finally coming to the end of college and is looking forward to a career in nursing. She has done pretty well up for herself and now it was her time to shine. Unluckily, it falls through when her mother robbed her of every penny and took her identity. Calla has to go back to her small home town and into the arms of Jax. Jax is handsome and cheerful! He is a waiter in a bar and knows Calla's mother very well and he agrees to help Calla. He is true alpha, with a sweet side and is very protective of Calla. I loved him, but not as much as Cam, sorry Jax! And that's why Stay with Me isn't as good as Cam's book, Wait for You. Don't get me wrong. Jax is an incredibly great character, well fleshed out and I did care for him, but he just wasn't as lovely as Cam. As for Calla, I liked her character, and I liked the connection between her and Jax. I loved how he _ and showed her to love herself, despite her unsatisfactory past. There are a lot of intense moments between these two characters and they are so well written. Jennifer's writing is addictive and she wrote the scenes between Jax and Calla beautifully. Calla has never been, what she would call boyfriend material, and so she struggles to see what Jax sees in her and she bats him off and ignores it. There's a lot of push and pull between them, and it's very charming. At times I did get a little annoyed with Calla, especially with her insecurity but Jax soon made up for that!

Some online shops also keep customers' opinions about each product, so you can easily find out what other customers think about the product before buying it. When you go for real-world shopping, you can actually touch and feel it, but in online shopping you can only see the pictures. Also if you are shopping online, you have to be careful with your credit cards. The first step in online shopping is to search for what you want to buy. Once you find the required product, put it in a \"shopping cart\" and continue shopping. After you have got enough in your \"shopping cart\", check out the product. You can add or take out the products in your shopping cart. The next step is to log in using a username and a password. Enter the address where you want the product to be sent. Some sites even ask for your email, phone numbers, etc. Then wait for the confirmation of your order. You can also cancel the order if needed. Online shopping is a different experience and you can make shopping online easy when you get used to it. From the text, we can know that  _", "subject": ""}

At the center of the festivities are the fierce horse racing, archery  and wrestling competitions, the traditional sports of the Mongolian warriors (the three \"manly\" sports, though young girls and women participate in the horse racing and archery contests). In Mongolian, the word \"Nadam\" means \"amusement and entertainment\" and the festival began in 1225 AD, when Genghis Khan organized an expedition to the west and got control of Khwarezm.

The Mongolians used this exciting gathering as a big occasion to compete in the horse racing, Mongolian wrestling and archery, which were regarded as the three basic skills of men.

Could it work? Why do songs stick in our heads? What does your school smell like? Is it noisy or peaceful? It might not seem important, but a growing body of research suggests that smells and sounds can have an impact on learning, performance and creativity. Indeed, some head teachers have recently taken to broadcasting noises and pumping smells into their schools to see whether it can boost grades. Is there anything in it? And if so, what are the implications for the way we work and study? There is certainly some well-established research to suggest that some noises can have a harmful effect on learning. Numerous studies over the past 15 years have found that children attending schools under the flight paths of large airports fall behind in their exam results. Bridget Shield, a professor of acoustics   at London South Bank University, and Julie Dockrell, from the Institute of Education, have been conducting studies on the effects of all sorts of noises, such as traffic and sirens  , as well as noise generated by the children themselves. When they recreated those particular sounds in an experimental setting while children completed various learning tasks, they found a significant negative effect on exam scores. \"Everything points to a bad impact of the noise on children's performance, in numeracy, in literacy, and in spelling,\" says Shield. The noise seemed to have an especially harmful effect on children with special needs. Whether background sounds are beneficial or not seems to depend on what kind of noise it is -- and the volume. In a series of studies published last year, Ravi Mehta from the College of Business at Illinois and his colleagues tested people's creativity while exposed to a soundtrack made up of background noises -- such as coffee-shop chatter and construction-site drilling -- at different volumes. They found that people were more creative when the background noises were played at a medium level than when volume was low. Loud background noise, however, damaged their creativity. Many teachers all over the world already play music to students in class. Many are inspired by the belief that hearing music can boost IQ in later tasks, the so-called Mozart effect. While the evidence actually suggests it's hard to say classical music boosts brainpower, researchers do think pleasant sounds before a task can sometimes lift your mood and help you perform well, says Perham, who has done his own studies on the phenomenon. The key appears to be that you enjoy what you're hearing. \"If you like the music or you like the sound -- even listening to a Stephen King novel -- then you do better. It doesn't matter about the music,\" he says. So, it seems that schools that choose to prevent disturbing noises and create positive soundscapes could enhance the learning of their students, so long as they make careful choices. Yet this isn't the only sense being used to affect learning. Special educational needs students at Sydenham high school in London are being encouraged to revise different subjects in the presence of different smells -- grapefruit scents for maths, lavender for French and spearmint for history.

But there are days, like today, when I wonder why. The results of an English quiz taken by my fifth-graders were depressing. Despite my best efforts, the world of pronouns remains a mystery to them. How I wish there were a way to make the study of our language as exciting as a computer game, so the glazed   looks would not appear in their eyes at the mention of the word \"grammar.\" I remember my husband's words: \"Why don't you quit? You'd probably make more money by doing something else, and you wouldn't have papers to grade every night.\" Tonight I have a stack of papers to grade, which I promised my students I would return tomorrow. But a friend, whom I haven't seen in a year, is visiting from Belgium, and I told her I would keep this evening free. Sitting in traffic behind a distant stoplight, it's hard not to replay the day. A voice reports the body of a local youngster, missing for weeks, has been identified. This missing child has had a deep effect on my students. They wondered, \"If it happened to her, could it happen to me?\" My children had found the answer themselves. They got out their pencils, markers and made cards. Cards were written with words of compassion and love for a mother and father they didn't know. Cards were filled with red hearts, golden crosses, flowers and angels. Their cards, intended to comfort others, comforted the children themselves by leading them past the anxiety, back into the world of security   that should be theirs. And then I remember why I'm still teaching. It's the children. They're more important than a lifetime filled with quiet evenings and more valuable than a pocket filled with money. My classroom, a child-filled world of discovery, of kindness and of caring is the real world. It's time to call my friend. I have promises to keep. She'll understand. After all, she's a teacher.
