However, that same parenting culture made a big mistake by telling parents they should tell their children how competent they were. Children can't be convinced that they are competent. Only your children can build their sense of competence. However, you can do several things to encourage them to develop their own competence. First, you can give them opportunities to gain a sense of competence. You should allow your children to \"get their hands dirty\" in the daily life and find out what they are capable of. These daily experiences allow your children to develop specific competencies that will be helpful to them as they grow up. Also, the more individual competencies children develop, the more they will view themselves as globally competent people. Second, you can be sure that they gain the most value from their experiences. You can direct their focus to the competences that enabled those successes rather than some generic  praise of the accomplishment itself. And you can also praise their accomplishments. A great difficulty for parents is allowing their children to be wrong or do something poorly in the mistaken belief that these experiences will hurt their sense of competence.

The problem largely results from the fact that both nations' names are read similarly in Mandarin Chinese  - Ruidian (Sweden) and Ruishi (Switzerland) - which begin with the same symbol. In an effort to put an end to the mix-up, the Swedish and Swiss consulates  in Shanghai have launched a competition on the Swedish Consulate website, asking Chinese people to come up with funny ways to help discriminate the two countries. Submissions can be accepted as a blog post, cartoon, photo, short film or in any other form. The winner with the best submission will receive a 12-day trip to Sweden and Switzerland and will be expected to report back on their impressions of both countries following the trip, the website states. Entries will be accepted until November 20. Sweden and Switzerland aren't the only destinations that have caused confusion among travelers. Last month, a British holidaymaker hoped to explore the architecture of the Alhambra Palace in Granada, Spain, but instead mistakenly caught a flight across the Atlantic to the Caribbean island of Grenada following a confusing booking mistake.

I see individuals getting frustrated as they struggle hard for success. One of the main reasons that cause this frustration is that people allow their definition of success to be determined by someone or something else. Another is that they become frustrated at their own apparent lack of success when comparing themselves to other people. We are individuals with individual wants, skills and experiences. We should look at our own skills to determine what is successful to us. We should look inwards to determine what it would mean for us to be successful in our own mind rather than someone else's. Evaluating a successful person needs to look at his pathway to success, his actions ,his determination and translate that into his own experience to see how he can improve himself. You must set your own course of action, and stay on your course. You alone must determine what success means to you. Do what you do to the best of your ability and the rest will take care of itself. For example, I believe that I am successful but I am not a millionaire! Others may not see me as successful in their eyes but that does not matter. It is how I see myself that is important to me and my life. Here is the truth. Being a success is doing your best, not being the best. Success is not something you become; it is something you continue being. When we get to that point, we will experience a lot more joy and a lot less frustration. And that sounds good to us!

In America, and in many other countries, one special kind of box contains the future. It's called a ballot box. What people put into the box on election day can change the course of history. Elections are the lifeblood of a democracy. The word democracy literally means \"the people rule,\" an important concept in American history. In the mid-1700s, England began passing laws that made the American colonies angry. The colonists had to pay more and more taxes and enjoyed less and less freedom. They felt the government of England didn't represent their interests. On July 4, 1776, the colonies declared their independence from England. They wanted to establish a democracy where people could have a voice in government. An effective democracy holds regular elections. In America, elections are held every two years for members of Congress. In these elections, all seats in the House of Representatives and one-third of the Senate seats are up for grabs. In addition, every four years, voters go to the polls to elect the nation's president and vice-president. Voters also regularly cast their ballots for state and city government leaders and local school board members. Sometimes they also have to vote on a proposed law. In the American electoral system, people don't really vote for presidential candidates. Instead, voters cast their ballots for \"electors\" who support each candidate. Each state has as many electors as the total number of its representatives in Congress. This equals two senators per state plus the number of its representatives in the House (which is based on the state's population). The candidate who has the most votes in a state wins all of the state's electors. To win the presidential election, a candidate must gain at least 270 of the 538 total electoral votes. Over the years, the U.S. has made a number of election reforms. Some early reforms outlawed cheating, giving bribes and threatening voters. They also limited the amount of money candidates could receive from donors and spend on their campaigns. In 1870, black people gained the right to vote, and in 1920, that right was extended to women. In recent decades, laws against unfair rules for voting have been passed. No longer do people have to pay a special tax or pass a test in order to vote. In 1971, the voting age was lowered to 18. Other reforms made voting easier for the blind, the disabled and people who couldn't read. In some areas, ballots had to be printed in languages besides English.

I want to tell people that selfish love might bring hate,\" Jiang said. \"I was shocked by their work and felt so proud to be the editor of my students' book,\" said Nathaniel Timmermann, the oral English teacher at the school. Liu Xiuqin, an English teacher, started the project by asking students to write whatever was in their mind every week. \"They have performed beyond expectation,\" Liu said. \"They wrote interesting stories and their English has improved after they started to express their real minds.\" \"We never imagined that our homework would be so popular and profitable  . We sell the novels at five yuan, but many teachers pay more to encourage us,\" said Yuan Mengyao. What is the best title of this passage?", "subject": ""}

There are some traditions that you can find almost anywhere, anytime, such as sending birthday cards, blowing out the candles on a birthday cake and singing the 'Happy Birthday' song. Others are only found for certain ages and in certain countries. In China, on a child's second birthday, family members put many things on the floor around the child. According to Chinese tradition, the first thing that the child picks up tells you what profession  the child will choose later in life. For Japanese children, the third, fifth and seventh birthdays are especially important. At this age, there is a special celebrationShichi-Go-San (seven, five, three in Japanese) when children go to the temple wearing a newkimono . Thepriest  gives them special sweets, and the parents usually organize a party for their friends in their home. In Argentina, Mexico and several other Latin American countries, girls have a special birthday celebration when they reach the age of fifteen. After a special ceremony , the girls dance a waltz with their father and other boys.

We provide the robot with seeing detectors  to keep it away from danger. It is powered entirely by the sun. Should we program the robot to be equally active at all times? No, the robot would be using up energy at a time when it was not receiving any. So we would probably program it to stop its activity at night and to wake up at dawn the next morning. According to evolutionary  theory of sleep, evolution equipped us with a regular pattern of sleeping and waking for the same reason. The theory does not deny that sleep provides some important restorative functions. It merely says that evolution has programmed us to perform those functions at a time when activity would be inefficient and possibly dangerous. However, sleep protects us only from the sort of trouble we might walk into; it does not protect us from trouble that comes looking for us. So we sleep well when we are in a familiar, safe place, but we sleep lightly, if at all, when we fear that bears will nose into the tent. The evolutionary theory explain the differences in sleep among creatures. Why do cats, for instance, sleep so much, while horses sleep so little? Surely cats do not need five times as much repair and restoration as horses do. But cats can afford to have long periods of inactivity because they spend little time eating and are unlikely to be attacked while they sleep.

Should they allow their children to train to become top sportsmen and sportswomen? For many children it means starting schoolwork very young, and going out with friends and other interests have to take a second place. It's very difficult to explain to a young child why he or she has to train five hours a day, even at the weekend, when most of his or her friends are playing. Another problem is of course money. In many countries money for training is available from government for the very best young sportsmen and sportswomen. If this help can not be given, it means that it is the parents who have to find the time and the money to support their child's development and sports clothes, transport to competitions, special equipment, etc. All can be very expensive. Many parents are worried that it is dangerous to start serious training in a sport at an early age. Some doctors agree that young muscles may he damaged by training before they are properly developed. Professional trainers, however, believe that it is only by training when young that you can reach the top as a successful sports person.

The flower, a lone dandelion  standing against the bright blue sky, inspired me. My dad had been reciting those words to me since I was a kid. That may even be the reason why I love writing. I decided that those words would be my gift to my father. I called back. I told my mom to go without me and that I already created my gift.

The SPF   measurement on sunscreens refers to the UVB protection level -- and the number may not mean what you think it does. SPF 15 doesn't protect you from 15% of UVB rays, just as SPF 100 doesn't protect you from 100% of the rays. In fact, as you get into the higher numbered SPF sunscreens (think: 50 and above), the difference in UVB protection is actually pretty small. Theoretically, though the increase in UVB protection with a super-high SPF sunscreen may be not worth considering, it may help, and certainly can't hurt, to use it -- that is, as long as you do so correctly. \"The only _ is whether you're giving yourself a sense of false security,\" Dr. Gohara says.

Regardless of any increase in protection that a high SPF may or may not offer, one thing is certain: It doesn't give your body a free pass from sunburns, aging, or cancers, and it doesn't protect you from those things for any greater length of time than the lower SPF options.

I sat down at the end of her very neatly-made bed, opposite the bedroom table on which she kept a Ming-style vase illustrated in great detail. She told me that my great-grandmother was still living in the surroundings of Beijing. Her name was Ren Li Ling and she was 97 years old. This was the first time I had ever heard of her. The dragon on the vase snaked through the flowers and vines as my mother said, \"Pu Pu, look at me. You need to hear this so that when you go to China you will understand. You must keep this knowledge in your heart.\" She told me a story about my grandfather, Ren Li Ling's son, who left Beijing to go to college in Taiwan. She told me how the Chinese civil war kept him away from his mother for fifty years, so neither of them even knew that the other was alive. No one from Taiwan could visit, write, or call anyone in mainland. All lines of communication were cut off. She told me of my grandfather's devotion to his own children, and how difficult it was for him to send his daughter to America for her education, fearing that same separation.

My great-aunt led me through a rotting doorway into a room with a furnace , table, and a rocking chair where an old woman wearing gloves sat facing the doorway, covered with a worn brown blanket. I walked over and immediately embraced this frail woman as if I had known her all my life. My limited, broken Chinese wasn't up to expressing my complicated feelings. And even though I couldn't completely understand what she was saying in her thick Beijing accent, I knew -- the same way I knew what my mother had been trying to tell me before I left. Her joy shone through her toothless smile. She wouldn't let go of my hand. I haltingly asked her how she had managed to live such a long life.

The following piece shows how that experience has influenced me.\" The night before I left for China, my mother called me into her room. I entered not knowing what to expect. I sat down at the end of her very neatly-made bed, opposite the bedroom table on which she kept a Ming-style vase illustrated in great detail. She told me that my great-grandmother was still living in the surroundings of Beijing. Her name was Ren Li Ling and she was 97 years old. This was the first time I had ever heard of her. The dragon on the vase snaked through the flowers and vines as my mother said, \"Pu Pu, look at me. You need to hear this so that when you go to China you will understand. You must keep this knowledge in your heart.\" She told me a story about my grandfather, Ren Li Ling's son, who left Beijing to go to college in Taiwan. She told me how the Chinese civil war kept him away from his mother for fifty years, so neither of them even knew that the other was alive. No one from Taiwan could visit, write, or call anyone in mainland. All lines of communication were cut off. She told me of my grandfather's devotion to his own children, and how difficult it was for him to send his daughter to America for her education, fearing that same separation. He gave my mother all that he could give -- nineteen years of love and fifty years of savings. I learned how my mother, through means only available in this country, would finally be able to unite my great-grandmother with my grandfather again. The dragon curled around the vase, connecting the separate vines. For a fleeting second, I felt it was present in my mother's room. It was all very strange, yet very clear. I began to understand that this trip to China was not just for me; it was for my mother, and her father, and his mother. Now, I had not only a future, but more significantly, a past. I saw the world with new eyes. And so I went to China and met my great-grandmother. My great-aunt picked me up at the training center, and we rode in a taxi through the crowded city. The noise of the taxi and the city united into a deep roar. We finally stopped in front of a narrow street lined on either side with small one-level houses. As we made our way to a house like all the others, I drew the stares of many people in the street. My great-aunt led me through a rotting doorway into a room with a furnace , table, and a rocking chair where an old woman wearing gloves sat facing the doorway, covered with a worn brown blanket. I walked over and immediately embraced this frail woman as if I had known her all my life. My limited, broken Chinese wasn't up to expressing my complicated feelings. And even though I couldn't completely understand what she was saying in her thick Beijing accent, I knew -- the same way I knew what my mother had been trying to tell me before I left. Her joy shone through her toothless smile. She wouldn't let go of my hand. I haltingly asked her how she had managed to live such a long life. She answered in words I will never forget, \"Hope has kept me alive. I have lived this long because I wanted to see my son before I died.\" My fellow team members must have wondered how two people separated by three generations could be so close. Before this trip, I would have wondered the same thing. And even now, I can't quite explain it. We were as different as two people can be; some 85 years and 8,000 miles apart.

The biggest change to the SAT   will be the introduction of a new writing section. The writing section will consist of two parts: an essay and a multiple-choice section. Students will be given 25 minutes to respond to a prompt   and construct a well-organized essay that effectively deals with the task. The essay question may require students to complete a statement, to react to a quote, or to agree or disagree with a point of view. In any case, a good essay will support the chosen position with specific reasons and examples from literature, history, art, science, current affairs, or even a student's own experiences. Essays will be scored based on the procedures for the current SAT II: Writing Test. Essays will be graded by two independent readers On a scale of 1~6, and their two scores will be combined to form an essay subscore that ranges from 2 to 12. Should the readers' scores vary by more than 2 points, a third reader will score the essay; The readers will be high school teachers and college professors who teach composition. To ensure that essays will be scored in a timely manner, they will be scanned and made available to readers on the Internet for grading purpose. The writing section will also include multiple-choice grammar and usage questions. Some of these questions will call upon students to improve given sentences and paragraphs. Others will present students with sentences and require them to identify mistakes in diction  , grammar, sentence construction, subject-verb agreement, proper word usage. The highest possible score on the new writing section will be 800. Scores on the essay and multiple-choice section will be combined to produce a single score.

William Blake's certainly were. The physical dangers and widespread unfairness of the chimney-sweeping job really stuck in his throat, so much so that he wrote not one, but two poems called \"The Chimney Sweeper\".

However, if you convince yourself beforehand that the pain won't be so bad, you might not suffer as much. According to a recent study, the part of your brain that reacts to severe pain is largely the same part that reacts to expectation of pain. Researchers in this study worked with 10 volunteers, aged 24 to 46. Each volunteer wore a device that gave out 20-second-long pulses of heat to the right leg. There were three levels of heat, producing mild, moderate, or strong pain. During training, the volunteers would first hear a tone, followed by a period of silence, and then feel a heat pulse. They then learned to associate the length of the silent pause with the intensity  of the upcoming heat pulse. The longer the pause, the stronger the heat pulse would be, causing more severe pain. A day or two later, the real experiment began. The researchers found that the parts of the brain involved in learning, memory, emotion, and touch became more active as the volunteers expected higher levels of pain. These were mainly the same areas that became active when participants actually felt pain. Interestingly, when the volunteers expected only mild or moderate pain but experienced severe pain, they reported feeling 28 percent less pain than when they expected severe pain and actually got it. The new study emphasizes that pain has both physical and psychological elements.

Is it anything we say which we know is untrue? Or is it something more than that? For example, suppose a friend wants to borrow some money from you. You say, \"I wish I could help you but I'm short of money myself.\" In fact you are not short of money but your friend is in the habit of not paying his debts and you don't want to hurt his feelings by reminding him of this. Is this really a lie?     Professor Gerald Gullion of theprefix = st1 /UniversityofSouthern Californiahas made a scientific study of lying. According to him, women are better liars than men, particularly when telling a \"white lie\", such as a woman at a party telling another woman that she likes her dress when she really thinks it looks awful. However, this is only one side of the story. Other researchers say that men are more likely to tell more serious lies, such as making a promise which they have no intention of fulfilling. This is the kind of lie politicians and businessmen are supposed to be particularly skilled at: the lie from which the liars hopes to profit or gain in some way. Research has also been done into the changes of people's behavior in a number of small, clearly unimportant ways when they lie. It has been found that if they are sitting down at the time, they tend to move about in their chairs more than usual. To the trained observer they are saying \"I wish I were somewhere else now\".

{"answer": 3, "choices": ["have little time to exercise", "hate to get regular exercise", "take more exercise to lose weight", "exercise more than men in their country"], "question": "Recently a study, led by Pedro Hallal of the Federal University, suggests that nearly a third of adults, 31%, are not getting enough exercise. That rates of exercise have declined is hardly a new discovery. Since the beginning of the industrial revolution, technology and economic growth have helped to create a world in which taking exercise is more and more an option rather than a necessity. But only recently have enough good data been collected from enough places to carry out the sort of analysis Dr Hallal and his colleagues have engaged in. There are common themes in different places.

Mark Shermis, professor of the College of Education at the University of Akron, is helping to hold a contest, set up by the William and Flora Hewlett Foundation ( WFHF), which promises $ 100,000 in prize money to programmers who write the best automated grading software. \"If you're a high school teacher and you give a writing task, you're walking home with 150 essays, \" Shermis said, \"You're going to need some help. \" Automated essay grading was first proposed in the 1960s, but computers back then were not up to the task. In the late 1990s, as technology improved, several textbook and testing companies jumped into the field. Today, computers are used to grade essays on South Dakota's student writing assessments and a handful of other exams, including the TOEFL test of English fluency, taken by foreign students. The Hewlett contest aims to show that computers can grade as well as English teachers---- only much more quickly and without all that depressing red ink. Automated essay scoring is \"objective,\" Shermis said, \" And it can be done immediately. If students finish an essay at l0 pm, they get a result at 10 :00 pm . \" Take, for instance, the Intelligent Essay Assessor, a web-based tool marketed by Pearson Education, Inc. Within seconds it can analyze an essay for spelling, grammar, organization, and help students to make revisions. The program scans for key words and analyzes semantic   patterns , and Pearson claims that it can understand the meaning of text much the same as a human reader.

Foods can go bad if they get too warm. But for many of the world's poor, finding a good way to keep food cool is difficult. Refrigerators are costly and they need electricity.        Yet spoiled food not only creates health risks but also economic losses. Farmers lose money when they have to throw away products that they can not sell quickly.        But in 1995, a teacher in northernprefix = st1 /Nigerianamed Mohammed Bath Abba found a solution. He developed the \"Pot-in-Pot Preservation/Cooling System\". It uses two round containers made of clay. A smaller pot is placed inside a larger one.        The space between the two pots is filled with wet sand. The inner pot can be filled with fruit, vegetables or drinks. A piece of wet cloth covers the whole cooling system.        Food stored in the smaller pot is kept from spoiling through a simple evaporation   process. Water in the sand between the two pots evaporates through the surface of the larger pot, where drier outside air is moving.        The evaporation process creates a drop in temperature of several degrees. This cools the inner pot and helps keep food safe from harmful bacteria. Some foods can be kept fresh this way for several weeks.        People throughoutNigeriabegan using the invention. And it became popular with farmers in other African countries. Mohammed Bah Abba personally financed   the first five thousand pot-in-pot systems for his own community and five villages nearby.

Within two or three minutes, I downed the entire plate of food and several Coca Colas. Before I left, she held out her hand and asked me to take the letter. Again seeing nothing, I held out my hand and closed my thumb and finger as though I were taking something from her. Tightly grasping nothing more than air, I walked out into the street and headed back to the park. The old woman was still there. \"It is really magic. Can I have the letter so I can be magic too?\" I asked her. She reached out, took my hand, and opened my tightly closed fingers. Whatever was being held between my fingers, she took and placed into her apron pocket. \"Would you help someone if they were hungry?\" she asked me. \"Yes Ma'am.\" \"Would you help someone if they were hurt, cold or scared?\" \"Yes Ma'am. I would be their friend.\" \"You are a very lucky little boy. You will never need the magic letter,\" she responded. What's the best title of the passage?", "subject": ""}

Her room is piled with shopping bags filled with blankets, towels, jeans, sweaters. She won't talk about going. I say, \"I'm going to miss you,\" and she gives me one of her looks and leaves the room. Another time I say, in a voice so friendly it surprises even me: \"Do you think you'll take your posters and pictures with you, or will you get new ones at college?\" She answers, her voice filled with annoyance, \"How should I know?\"  My daughter is off with friends most of the time. Yesterday was the last day she'd have until Christmas with her friend Katharine, whom she's known since kindergarten. Soon, it will be her last day with Sarah, Claire, Heather... and then it will be her last day with me.  My friend Karen told me, \"The August before I left for college, I screamed at my mother the whole month. Be prepared.\"  I stand in the kitchen, watching Allie make a glass of iced tea. Her face, once so open and trusting, is closed to me. I struggle to think of something to say to her, something meaningful and warm. I want her to know I'm excited about the college she has chosen, that I know the adventure of her life is just starting and that I am proud of her. But the look on her face is so mad that I think she might hit me if I open my mouth.  One night -- after a long period of silence between us -- I asked what I might have done or said to make her angry with me. She sighed and said, \"Mom, you haven't done anything. It's fine.\" It is fine -- just distant.  Somehow in the past we had always found some way to connect. When Allie was a baby, I would go to the day-care center after work. I'd find a quiet spot and she would nurse -- our eyes locked together, reconnecting with each other.  In middle school, when other mothers were already regretting the distant relationship they felt with their adolescent daughters, I hit upon a solution: rescue measures. I would show up occasionally at school, sign her out of class and take her somewhere -- out to lunch, to the movies, once for a long walk on the beach. It may sound irresponsible, but it kept us close when other mothers and daughters were quarrelling. We talked about everything on those outings -- outings we kept secret from family and friends.  When she started high school, I'd get up with her in the morning to make her a sandwich for lunch, and we'd silently drink a cup of tea together before the 6:40 bus came.  A couple of times during her senior year I went into her room at night, the light off, but before she went to sleep. I'd sit on the edge of her bed, and she'd tell me about problems: a teacher who lowered her grade because she was too shy to talk in class, a boy who teased her, a friend who had started smoking. Her voice, coming out of the darkness, was young and questioning.  A few days later I'd hear her on the phone, repeating some of the things I had said, things she had adopted for her own.  But now we are having two kinds of partings. I want to say good-bye in a romantic way. For example, we can go to lunch and lean across the table and say how much we will miss each other. I want smiles through tears, bittersweet moments of memory and the chance to offer some last bits of wisdom. But as she prepares to depart, Allie has hidden her feelings. When I reach to touch her arm, she pulls away. She turns down every invitation I extend. She lies on her bed, reading Emily Dickinson until I say I have always loved Emily Dickinson, and then she closes the book. Some say the tighter your bond with your child, the greater her need to break away, to establish her own identity in the world. The more it will hurt, they say.

I sometimes feel so angry that I want to go over and shake Allie. I want to say, \"Talk to me -- or you're grounded!\" I feel myself wanting to say that most horrible of all mother phrases: \"Think of everything I've done for you.\" Late one night, as I'm getting ready for bed she comes to the bathroom door and watches me brush my teeth. For a moment, I think I must be brushing my teeth in a way she doesn't approve of. But then she says, \"I want to read you something.\" It's a brochure from her college. \"These are tips for parents.\" I watch her face as she reads the advice aloud: \" 'Don't ask your child if she is homesick,' it says. 'She might feel bad the first few weeks, but don't let it worry you. This is a natural time of transition. Write her letters and call her a lot. Send a package of candies...' \" Her voice breaks, and she comes over to me and buries her head in my shoulder. I stroke her hair, lightly, afraid she'll run if I say a word. We stand there together for long moments, swaying. Reconnecting. I know it will be hard again. It's likely there will be a fight about something.

Have you ever dreamed something that came true later? Maybe you have ESP. ESP stands for Extra Sensory Perception. It may be called a sixth sense. It seems to let people know about events before they happen, or events that are happening some distance away. Here is an example: A woman was doing washing. Suddenly she shouted, \"My father is dead! I saw him sitting in the chair!\" Just then, a telephone came. The woman's father had died of a heart illness. He died sitting in a chair. There are thousands of stories like this on record. Scientists are studying them to find out what is behind these strange mental messages. Here's another example ---- one of hundreds of dreams that have come true. A man dreamed he was walking along a road when a horse and carriage came by. The driver said, \"There's room for one more.\" The man felt the driver was Death, so he ran away. The next day the man was getting on a crowded bus. The bus driver said, \"There's room for one more\". Then the man saw the driver's face was the same face he had seen in the dream. He wouldn't get on the bus. As the bus drove off, it crashed and burst into fires. Everyone was killed! Some people say stories like these are lies or coincidences.

But none of these jobs was as terrible as my job in an apple plant . The work was hard; the pay was poor; and, most of all, the working conditions were terrible. First of all, the job made huge demands on my strength. For ten hours a night, I took boxes that rolled down a metal track and piled them onto a truck. Each box contained twelve heavy bottles of apple juice. I once figured out that I was lifting an average of twelve tons of apple juice every night. I would not have minded the difficulty of the work so much if the pay had not been so poor. I was paid the lowest wage of that time--two dollars an hour. Because of the low pay, I felt eager to get as much as possible. I usually worked twelve hours a night but did not take home much more than $ 100 a week. But even more than the low pay, what made me unhappy were the working conditions. During work I was limited to two ten-minute breaks and an unpaid half hour for lunch. Most of my time was spent outside loading trucks with those heavy boxes in near-zero-degree temperatures. The steel floors of the trucks were like ice, which made my feet feel like stone.

{"answer": 2, "choices": ["Driving Classes.", "Driving Learning.", "Driving Course.", "Driving Experience."], "question": "In America, drivers' education is part of the regular high school curriculum. Every student in his or her second year of high school is required to take a class in driver's education. However, unlike other courses, it is not given during the regular school year. Instead it is a summer course. The course is divided up into two parts: class time for learning laws and regulations and driving time to practice driving. Class time is not unlike any other class. The students have a text from which they study the basic laws they must know to pass the written driving test that is given to anyone wanting to get a driver's license. Driving time is a chance for the students to get behind the wheel (steering wheel) and practice starting steering, backing up, parking, switching lanes, turning corners, and all the other maneuvers   required to drive a car. Each student is required to drive a total of six hours. The students are divided up into groups of four. The students and the instructor go out driving for two hour blocks of time. Thus, each student gets half an hour driving time per outing. The instructor and \"driver\" sit in the front seats and the other three students sit in the back. Drivers Ed cars are unlike other cars in which they have two sets of brakes, one on the driver's side and one on the other side where the instructor sits. Thus, if the student driver should run into difficulties the instructor can take over. The car also has another special feature. On the top of the car is a sign that reads: STUDENT DRIVER. That lets nearby drivers know that they should use extra caution because the student driver is a beginning driver, not very experienced and prone to driving slowly. After the student has passed the driver's education course and reached the appropriate age to drive (this age differs in every state but in most cases the person must be 16 years old), they can go to a designated state office to take their driver's test, which is made up of an eye examination, a written test, and a road test. The person must pass all three tests in order to be given a driver's license.

And how do you think other people would treat you? Isabelle Dinoire is someone who can answer all of these questions honestly and openly. Last November Isabelle was attacked and mauled by her own dog. The attack was so severe that her lower face was damaged; it seemed, almost beyond repair. She was rushed to hospital and became the first person ever to have a face transplant. With such severe injuries doctors offered Isabelle little hope that they would be able to repair the damage to her face using conventional surgery. Shortly after being admitted, she came to the attention of Dr Bernard Devauchelle who, unlike other surgeons, believed there was an alternative: \"We found ourselves saying, yes, it's clear this woman needs a transplant,\" he said. Two days after the operation she saw her face in the mirror for the first time. She said \"I was scared to look at myself, but when I did it was already marvelous and I couldn't believe it.

Like our sun, stars are unbelievably hot furnaces   that burn their own matter as fuel. When most of the fuel is used up, the star begins to die. The death of a star is not a quiet event. First there is a huge explosion. As its outer layer is blasted off into space, the dying star shines as brightly as a billion suns. After the explosion gravity pulls in what's left of the star. As the outside of the star sinks toward the center, the star gets smaller and smaller. The material the star is made of becomes tightly packed together. A star is so dense that a teaspoon of matter from it weighs billion of pounds. The more the star shrinks, the stronger the gravity inside it becomes. Soon the star is very tiny, and the gravity pulling it in is unbelievably strong. In fact, the gravity is so strong that it even pulls light into the star! Since all the light is pulled in, none can go out. The star becomes black when there is no light. Then a black hole is born! That's what we know about black holes.

Such a possibility is hard to imagine. But if the black hole doesn't keep shrinking, what happens to it? Some scientists think black holes are like doorways to another world.

Here are some. The sea turtles tend to live in water, but the females come over to lands for nesting. This is the time when they are in the most vulnerable   position. Their nesting areas have been taken over by human settlements and recreation development. This has forced them to search for areas that are less suitable for nesting. The egg is the first step for a sea turtle to have a chance of life. And this first step of life has become vulnerable in many countries. The sea turtles have no way to protect their eggs. As a result, the poachers   have an opportunity to steal their eggs. The sea turtles are caught in shrimping vessels   that use nets. The nets can drown these poor creatures. They die, as the nets are not pulled out fast. Gill nets and drilling for oil also _ habitat destruction and injury to the animal. One female sea turtle can lay hundreds of eggs in one nesting season. These eggs are preyed on by crabs  , foxes, birds, and humans, as they make their run towards the sea. By the time they reach the shallow water, half of them have been removed by their predators   on land and some are eaten up by fish in water. Only a few lucky ones win the battle of survival and live past their 1st birthday! The sea turtles take more than a decade to reach maturity. Then they start breeding and adult turtles have to live for many years to maintain the balance of population. However, as mentioned above, the adults face a lot of hardships for surviving. Pollution, long lines of fishing fleets, high seas, and even tumors, etc., all cause death of these massive, beautiful species. When sea turtles are nesting, probably   _  .", "subject": ""}
{"answer": 0, "choices": ["Global warming makes fish smaller.", "Global warming makes fish decrease in numbers.", "Global warming affects the fish distribution.", "Global warming affects the ability of fish to reproduce."], "question": "Fish species are expected to shrink in size by up to 24% because of global warming, say scientists. The scientists argue that failure to control greenhouse gas emissions will have a greater effect on marine ecosystems than previously thought. Previous research has suggested that changing ocean temperatures would affect both the distribution and the reproductive abilities of many species of fish. This new work suggests that fish size would also be heavily affected. The researchers built a model to see how fish would react to lower levels of oxygen in the water. As ocean temperatures increase, so do the body temperatures of fish. But, according to lead author, Dr William Cheung, from the University of British Columbia, the lower level of oxygen in the water is key. Warmer waters could decrease ocean oxygen levels and greatly reduce fish body weight. On the other hand, rising temperatures directly increase the metabolic rate of the fish's body function. This leads to an increase in oxygen demand for normal body activities. So the fish will run out of oxygen for growth at a smaller body size. The research team also used its model to predict fish movements as a result of warming waters. The group believes that most fish populations will move towards the Earth's poles at a rate of up to 35km per decade. \"So in, say, the North Sea,\" says Dr Cheung,\" one would expect to see more smaller-body fish from tropical waters in the future.\" Taking these factors into consideration, the research team concludes that fish body size will shrink between 14% and 24%, with the largest decreases in the Indian and Atlantic oceans. When compared with actual observations of fish sizes, the model seems to _ what's actually happening in the seas. The researchers looked at two case studies involving North Atlantic cod and haddock. They found that recorded data on these fish showed greater decreases in body size than the models had predicted. Dr Alan Baudron, from the University of Aberdeen, UK, believes smaller-sized fish could seriously affect the ability of fish to reproduce. \"Smaller fish produce fewer and smaller eggs which could affect the reproductive potential of fish stocks,\" he said.

Activities like playing computer games, going on the Net and downloading MP3s are only for the youngsters. Isn't it unfair that older people enjoying a computer game should be frowned  upon by their children and grandchildren? Nowadays older people have more control over their lives and they play a full part in society. Moreover, better health care has left more people in their sixties and seventies feeling fit and active after retirement. Mental activity, as well as physical exercise, can contribute to better health. Playing computer games is a very effective way of exercising the brain. When personal computers were first introduced, most older people didn't believe they would ever familiarize themselves with it. Now computers have been around for a few generations and retired people have gradually become more relaxed about using them for fun. Gamers over 65 prefer playing puzzle games and card games. Kate Stevens, aged 72, says: \"I find it very relaxing. It's not very demanding, but you still need to concentrate.\" Another development that has favored \"grey games\" is a change in the type of videogames available on the market. There's a greater variety of games to choose from, including more intellectual and complex strategy  and simulation  games. Internet Chess and Train Simulator are among the most popular of these. Train Simulator is based on real-world rail activities. Players can choose from a variety of challenges, such as keeping to a strict-timetable and using helper engines during a winter storm. Some people argue that \"grey gamers\" simply don't have the skills required for computer games, and that teenagers are better. _ . Most computer games require the kind of analytical thinking that improves with practice, which means that the \"grey gamers\" may well be far better than gamers half a century younger than them. In games where speed is the main consideration, older people would be at a disadvantage because they may have slower reaction times. On the other hand, \"grey gamers\" have a preference for slower paced, mind challenging games. What was older people's attitude towards personal computers at first?", "subject": ""}

There are now about 360 species of sharks, whose size, behavior, and other characteristics differ widely. Every year, we catch and kill over 100 million sharks, mostly for food and for their fins. Dried shark fins are used to make shark fin soup, which sells for as much as $50 a bowl in fine Hong Kong restaurants. Other sharks are killed for sport and out of fear. Sharks are vulnerable  to overfishing because it takes most species 10 to 15 years to begin reproducing and they produce only a few offspring . Influenced by movies and popular novels, most people see sharks as people-eating monsters. This is far from the truth. Every year, a few types of shark injure about 100 people worldwide and kill about 25. Most attacks are by great white sharks, which often feed on sea lions and other marine  mammals. They sometimes mistake human swimmers for their normal prey, especially if they are wearing black wet suits. If you are a typical ocean-goer, your chances of being killed by an unprovoked attack by a shark are about 1 in 100 million. You are more likely to be killed by a pig than a shark and thousands of times more likely to get killed when you drive a car. Sharks help save human lives. In addition to providing people with food, they are helping us learn how to fight cancer, bacteria, and viruses. Sharks are very healthy and have aging processes similar to ours. Their highly effective immune system allows wounds to heal quickly without becoming infected, and their blood is being studied in connection with AIDS research. Sharks are among the few animals in the world that almost never get cancer and eye cataracts . Understanding why can help us improve human health. Chemicals taken from shark cartilage have killed cancerous tumors in laboratory animals, research that someday could help _ your life. Sharks are needed in the world's ocean ecosystems.

{"answer": 1, "choices": ["we'd better be cautious about raw and whole foods", "foods with natural enzymes help people keep fit", "it is important for people to protect their vital organs", "giving up cooked and refined foods is a new lifestyle"], "question": "Why are people interested in eating raw foods or whole foods   ? One reason is that eating these types of food reduces the risk of acid   accumulation in your body. Raw and whole foods are usually digested more efficiently than cooked foods. When we cook foods, we destroy the natural enzymes   that are part of the food in its raw form. These enzymes were intended by nature to help us digest the food. When we consume food without these natural enzymes, our bodies either digest the food improperly or allow too many nutrients to be absorbed into the bloodstream. In both instances, the result is overweight. When too many nutrients are absorbed at once, the body grows fat. Improperly digested food moves slowly through the digestive system, where it becomes increasingly acidic. To protect its vital organs from this acidic waste, the body changes the acid into fat and stores it safely away from the organs. Processed foods   contain chemical elements, which might confuse the appetite mechanism that tells us when we've had enough to eat; as a result, people often overeat. Processed foods also upset the digestive cycle. The body will either identify these foods as allergens and then store them safely away from the organs as fat, or the remains of undigested food will become acidic and enter the bloodstream as acid waste, which will stick to the blood vessel walls and block the passage of vital oxygen and nutrients heading for the body's cells. The body's metabolism   becomes inactive, and the result is weight gain and obesity. The accumulation of acid in the digestive system makes digestion increasingly inefficient. When that happens, even healthy foods can become acidic and the food allergies will become more common. To stop this vicious circle in its tracks, people need to consume food and supplements that will neutralize the acid already accumulated in body. Eating the right types of raw and whole foods can help. It's also important to restore your enzyme balance. You need to identify and avoid the foods that cause acid accumulation and consume the foods that increase enzyme production. If you truly want to change and help your body heal itself, you need to take an active approach. One effective way is to choose raw and whole foods appropriately according to your health conditions and personal preferences. It can be inferred from Para. 2 that   _  .", "subject": ""}

{"answer": 2, "choices": ["trees", "tunnel fans", "windows", "poles"], "question": "Planting trees around poultry farms can improve air and water quality -- and relations with neighbors. Research has shown that just three rows of trees near poultry houses can reduce the release of dust and ammonia . They can also reduce the strong smell of ammonia gas. The trees take dust, ammonia and odors in their leaves. They also provide shade from the sun, so they reduce cooling costs in summer. And they act as a windbreak, so they reduce heating costs in winter. Trees can also improve water quality around farms by removing pollutions from soil and groundwater. Several years ago, people were objecting to the odor of poultry farms on the Delmarva Peninsula in the eastern United State  s. Delmarva is where the states of Delaware, Maryland and Virginia come together. Two thousand farms there can each house an average of seventy-five thousand chickens. Traditionally the farms used windows to provide fresh air in the chicken houses. Farmers rarely planted trees or tall crops around the buildings, so there would be no barrier to the airflow. But then farms began to use new ventilation systems. Instead of windows, the new systems used tunnel fans to circulate air. The fans directed airflow from the poultry houses toward the homes of neighbors. Researchers began dealing with the problem in two thousand. They found that over a period of six years, planting three rows of trees reduced total dust and ammonia by more than half. And they found that smells were reduced by eighteen percent. Farmers may think trees will take too long to grow and be effective. But some trees can grow quickly. At least one-third of the Delmarva farms have planted trees, technically known as vegetative environmental buffers. The idea offers a way to cut pollution, save money and energy, and make the neighbors happy.

It had snowed heavily the night before, and Mr. Smith's son Bobby had a new sledge  , which he had been very eager to try out for a long while. There was a good slope   in a park not far away from the Smiths' house -- a slope which children often used for their sledges, so Mr. Smith agreed to take Bobby there in the car. They put the sledge in and went off.  When they reached the park, they found that there were already a lot of boys there, each boy with a sledge of his own. They were sliding down the slope at great speed, and then pulling their sledges up again for another go.  Mr. Smith stood by, watching them with a smile. It was obvious that each and every one of them had much fun. After a few moments, Mr. Smith suddenly saw among the boys a kid who was small and poorly-dressed, and did not have a sledge. This boy had flattened out one old cardboard box, and was sliding down the slope on that. Mr. Smith felt very sorry for this poor boy, and determined to tell his son Bobby to share his new sledge with the boy.  But before he could catch Bobby to speak to him, he was somewhat surprised -- and much more delighted -- to notice that several of the older boys in the park were already offering the poor boy their nice sledges. Mr. Smith watched them with greater interest -- and suddenly realized that the bigger boys were not doing this because they felt sorry for the poor boy, but because they enjoyed riding on his cardboard box more than on their own sledges.

{"answer": 0, "choices": ["100", "200", "300", "400"], "question": "The Italian island of Sardinia recently lost its oldest citizen. Family members say Antonio Todde died in his sleep early this month. Mr. Todde was 112 years old. It was less than three weeks away from his 113thbirthday. Record-keeping experts say he was the world's oldest man.          His long life and that of other very old Sardinians are the subjects of a scientific project called Akea. Luca Deiana of Sassari University is directing the study. He says the name Akea comes from a traditional greeting on Sardinia. It means\"health and life for 100 years\". Professor Deiana and his team started to collect information for the study in 1997. They identified more than 220 Sardinians who were centenarians--100years old or older. His team required three documents to confirm a person's age. They were a government birth record, a church record and a statement by a close family member.          The Akea study has produced two major findings. The first is Sardinia's extremely high number of centenarians. The island had about 135 centenarians for every one million people. In other Western countries, the average is about seventy five centenarians for every one million people. The second major finding is an unusual rate of female to male centenarians. Sardinia has two women centenarians for every male centenarian. In central Sardinia there are equal numbers of female and male centenarians.          Studies in other parts of the world have shown a much higher percentage of female centenarians. The Akea study collected information about the health and diet of about 140 of the centenarians. About ninety percent of those in the study agreed to provide blood for scientific testing. The study team hope to identify genetic material in the blood that can be linked to successful aging.

Experts say that the Shenzhou spacecraft already provides China with a space vehicle capable of mounting a lunar program.

They started to hang out together, laughing and talking. Mini's new friend would give her raisins   and almonds   , spending the little money he had on her. The two of them enjoyed joking together. The Cabuliwallah, who was called Rahmun, would say: \"Well, little one, when are you going to the father-in-law's house?\" Mini did not understand this and was puzzled. One morning, I heard uproar   in the street, and saw Rahmun being led away by the police. There were bloodstains on his clothes. I gathered that a neighbor had owed Rahmun money for a shawl   but had falsely denied having bought it, and that in the course of the quarrel Rahmun had struck him. On a charge of murderous assault  , Rahmun was sentenced to jail. Time passed, and he was not remembered. Mini grew up and we were making arrangements for her wedding. I was sitting in my study when someone entered. It was Rahmun, the Cabuliwallah, released from prison. Barely recognizable now, he asked to see Mini and said that all those years ago she had reminded him of his own daughter in Kabul. It was his belief that Mini was still the same. He had pictured her running to him calling \"Cabuliwallah!\". He had imagined that they would laugh and talk together. In fact, he had brought her, wrapped up in paper, a few almonds and grapes.

Each passing minute seemed to be as long as a century. After an hour, Xu was called with three other people to a window for their interview. Two were rejected before his turn. Then the American officer, speaking fluent Chinese, reached for Xu's paperwork, asked some simple questions and said, \"Congratulations.\" \"I was so nervous. The first thing I did when I got out was to call my mom and tell her I passed,\" Xu said. \"She was the one who warned me it wasn't going to be easy.\" Why does the author give a detailed description of Xu Yong's experience?", "subject": ""}

He knew how to read but he had never seen a book in his life. So he asked the new priest in his village to give him one. But there was no electricity. So Leonardo borrowed candles from the church and sat up all night reading it. The next morning, he was at the door of the priest asking for another book to read. John Medcalf, the priest,was moved. He also realised that people would love to read if given a chance. But he knew how difficult it was for Leonardo and those in his village to get books. And yet, no one can be taught to read and write without books. To make people in a poor, faraway area grow to love books,they have to be with them. So he thought the only way was to bring books to people. But how could _ be done? Mobile libraries or car libraries would be too expensive and difficult to continue in the rocky, hilly land of Peru. So what other method could be used? Medcalf got a new idea from the barefoot doctors of China. And that was how the barefoot librarians first appeared in the villages of northern Peru,almost thirty years ago. The librarians began by going from village to village, lending books to villagers. They helped start The 12ura1 Library Network of Peru. At first,they were teachers of the village schools which these faraway libraries belonged to. But the teachers were not very interested in the job because it meant a lot of hard work. So, village leaders took on the job themselves. Today, there are 600 village libraries across Peru. The barefoot librarians who walk up to 15 hours a day with bags of books are their lifeline. It can be inferred from the passage that  _  .", "subject": ""}

Movies, television and video games are full of gunplay and bloodshed, and one might reasonably ask what's wrong with a society that presents videos of violence as entertainment. Viewing large amounts of violent television and video games may well contribute to violent behavior in certain individuals. The trouble comes when researchers downplay uncertainties in their studies or overstate the case for causality . Skeptics were dismayed several years ago when a group of societies including the American Medical Association tried to end the debate by issuing a joint statement: \"At this time, well over 1,000 studies... point to a causal connection between media violence and aggressive behavior in some children.\" Freedom-of-speech advocates accused the societies of catering to politicians, and even disputed the number of studies (most were review articles and essays, they said). When Jonathan Freedman, a social psychologist at the University of Toronto, reviewed the literature, he found only 200 or so studies of television-watching and aggression. And when he weeded out \"the most doubtful measures of aggression\", only 28% supported a connection. The critical point here is causality. The alarmists say they have proved that violent media cause aggression. But the assumptions behind their observations need to be examined. When labeling games as violent or non-violent, should a hero eating a ghost really be counted as a violent event?

Dubos (1969) suggested that primitive humans were closer to the animals because they, too, relied upon their instincts to stay healthy. Yet some primitive humans recognized a cause and effect relationship between doing certain things and alleviating symptoms of a disease or improving the condition of a wound. Since there was so much that primitive humans did not understand about the functioning of the body, magic became an integral component of the beliefs about the causes and cures of health disorders. So it is not surprising that early humans thought that illness was caused by evil spirits. Primitive medicines made from vegetables or animals were invariably used in combination with some form of ritual   to drive harmful spirits away from a diseased body. One of the earliest attempts in the Western world to formulate principles of health care based upon rational thought and rejection of supernatural phenomena is found in the work of the Greek physician Hippocrates.

A complete DNA read - out for every newborn will be technically possible and affordable in less than five years, promising a revolution in healthcare, says Jay Flatley, the chief executive of Illumina. Only social and legal problems are likely to delay the age of \"genome sequences,\" or genetic profiles. By 2019 it will have become routine to map infants' genes when they are born, Dr Flatly told The Times. This will open a new approach to medicine, by which conditions such as high blood pressure and heart disease can be predicted and prevented and drugs used more safely and effectively. A baby's genome can be discovered at birth by a blood test. By examining a person's genome, it is possible to identify raised risks of developing diseases such as cancers. Those at high risk can then be screened more regularly, or given drugs or dietary advice to lower their chances of becoming ill.  Personal genomes could also be used to ensure that patients get the medicine that is most likely to work for them and least likely to have side-effects. The development, however, will raise legal concerns about privacy and access to individuals' genetic records. \"Bad things can be done with the genome. It could predict something about someone - and you could possibly hand the information to their employer or their insurance company.\" said Dr Flatley. \"People have to recognize that  _ , and that your genome probably can't be protected, because everywhere you go you leave your genome behind. Complete genetic privacy, however, is unlikely to be possible\", he added. As the benefits become clearer, however, he believes that most people will want their genomes read and interpreted. The risk is nothing compared with the gain. What's Dr Flatley's attitude towards the technology?", "subject": ""}

The seventh child of a country priest ,Jane Austen was born on 16 December 1775 at Steventon in Hampshire.Her father ,the Reverend George Austen,was an intelligent and sensitive man who encouraged Jane in her love of reading.From an early age she was familiar with the works of Henry Fielding,Sir Walter Scott,Richardson,Frances Burney and the poet George Crabbe.Her early attempts at writing include burlesques of popular romances.When her father retired in 1801 the family moved to Bath,which was later to feature in her novel Northanger Abbey(published in 1818).After his death in 1805 the family moved first to Southampton and then in 1809 to Chawton in Hampshire.where Jane Austen is known to have written her last three novels:Mansfield Park(1814),Emma(1816)and Persuasion(also published in 1818).Although her other novels were written much earlier ,it was not until 1811 that Sense and Sensibility was first published.Pride and Prejudice,which followed in1813,features Jane Austen'own favourite hero,Elizabeth Bennet. Surrounded by her lively and warm family and wholly buried herself in her writing and housework,Jane Austen led a life often known for its lack of events.She did,however ,attract several admirers and even accepted a proposal of marriage from one admirer-only to change her mind the following morning.Jane Austen's independent life often seems reflected in her novels,which seem to display the world in miniature .Sir Walter Scott praised Jane Austen for'that unique _ which makes ordinary commonplace things and characters interesting',while Somerset Maugham claimed that she had at her command 'the most precious gift a novelist can possess's that of keeping the reader's interest.Jane Austen died in 1817.

Those tides are caused by the force of the Moon's gravity and the rotation  of the Earth. Gravity acts on the center of any solid object. The Earth is mostly molten  rock, but compared to the oceans, we can think of it as a solid object. As you know, the oceans are fluid and lie on the surface of the Earth. When the Moon is overhead, the oceans are four thousand miles closer to the Moon than the Earth's center is. Because the oceans are closer, the Moon pulls harder on the water than on the Earth. This stronger pull makes the water bunch up  a little under the Moon, creating a high tide. At the same time, the oceans on the opposite side of the Earth are four thousand miles farther from the Moon than the Earth's center is. The Moon's pull on this water is weak. This water bunches up because it is \"left behind\"(making another high tide) as the Earth is pulled slightly towards the Moon. When the waters bunch up on these two sides of the Earth, they draw water away from the other sides of the Earth, which creates the low tides. As the Earth rotates, different parts of the land and oceans pass through the high-tide and low-tide zones. And that makes the waters on our coasts go up and down.

I was struck by her talent, fresh charm and innocence the moment I caught sight of her. She was, and remains, a gifted actress and a good human being. It is not for me to judge Ms Lohan's choices, or whether fame has been less than kind to her, but I have been greatly saddened by the way the media have chosen, with all gloves off and seemingly going with what could please them, to record her efforts and failures.  She is a sentient   human being, not a thing, not a product, not anything else to be sold. Charles McGrath makes several attractive points in his news analysis about the public demand which is impossible to satisfy, in a 24/7 news cycle forever changed by the Internet, to gossip about, and give nearly complete access to, celebrity or famous persons' lives. Perhaps people do feel better knowing that wealth and fame do not lead to a perfect life for everyone.  Perhaps we admire famous people only to reject them without any pity or mercy when their behavior disappoints us. I find it ironic   that Ms Lohan's decision to pose for Playboy for a monetary reward is considered to be morally questionable, while journalists and photographers gain profit by writing about and capturing images of her and other famous people.

In cities like Amsterdam and The Hague, up to 70 percent of all journeys are made by bike,\" said BBC.  So how did cycling become such a popular means of transportation in the European country? In the 1970s, the Dutch government began to improve its cycling infrastructure due to both a social movement demanding safer cycling condition for children and the oil crisis in the Middle East, when oil producing countries stopped their exports to Western Europe. To make cycling safer and more appealing, the Dutch have built the widest cycling network in the world. The country has over 40,000 kilometers of bicycle lanes and paths,which are clearly marked. They have smooth surfaces,separate signs and lights for those on two wheels. The lanes are wide enough to allow side-by-side cycling and passing. In many cities the bike lanes are completely segregated from motorized traffic. And in many traffic situations cyclists are given priority over drivers. Sometimes,where space is limited and both must share, you can see signs showing an image of a cyclist with a car behind accompanied by the words \"Bike Street:Cars are guests\". As young people aren't allowed to drive alone until they are 18, cycling offers Dutch teenagers an alternative form of freedom. The government also makes cycling training lessons a compulsory part of the Dutch school curriculum . Bike parking facilities are everywhere in the country. Cyclists are accommodated in the way motorists are elsewhere. Take Groningen, a city in the northeastern part of the Netherlands, for example. The city's central train station has underground parking for 10,000 bikes. For many Dutch people, bikes are trusty friends for life's adventures.

{"answer": 2, "choices": ["is often small in size", "can produce more than enough crops for Africans", "is short of important nutrients", "has got the attention of scientists around the world"], "question": "Studies show farmland in Africa is often lacking in important nutrients. But researchers say combining different farming methods may help. Since the world food crisis several years ago, researchers have directed more of their attention to small farms. Most farms in areas south of the Sahara Desert are only about one or two hectares. One of the goals is to increase production without necessarily clearing more land to grow additional crops. American researchers say that can happen with greater use of an agricultural system called perennation. It mixes food crops with trees and perennial plants - those that return year after year. Mr. Reganold, who is with Washington State University, says poor soil may have resulted from years of weathering that washed away many nutrients. He says some farmers may have done more harm than good. He estimates that up to two billion dollars worth of nitrogen, phosphorous and potassium is lost from African soil each year. The scientist says the word perennation defines three systems that are already used in Africa. The oldest of the three is called evergreen agriculture. This is where farmers plant trees with their crops. John Reganold says farmers in Africa have been doing this for sixty years, but it seems to be growing in popularity. The method is gaining widespread use in countries such as Niger, Burkina Faso, Malawi and Zambia. The trees are planted among maize, millet or sorghum crops. They not only add nitrogen to the soil through their roots, but also through their leaves when they fall off and break down.

The most common types of people to use small talk are those who do not know each other at all. It is also common for people who are only acquaintances  , often called a \"friend of a friend\", to use small talk. There are certain \"safe\" topics that people usually make small talk about. The weather is probably the number one thing. Sometimes even friends and family members discuss the weather when they meet or start a conversation. Another topic that is generally \"safe\" is current events, such as sports news and entertainment news. If there is something that you and the other speaker have in common, that may also be acceptable to talk about. Negative comments about another person not involved in the conversation are not acceptable because you cannot be sure who his friends are when you do not know a person well. People make small talk just about anywhere. Most often, small talk happens in places where people are waiting for something. For example, you might chat with another person who is waiting for the bus to arrive. Some social events (such as a party) require small talk among guests who do not know each other very well. The most common time for small talk to happen is the first time you see or meet someone. However, the next time you see each other, you might just smile and say nothing. Do not interrupt two people in order to discuss something unimportant, such as the weather. If someone is reading a book or writing a letter in a waiting room, it is not proper to _ a conversation either. What can we learn about small talk according to the text?", "subject": ""}

This behavior interests scientists and they wonder how ants know for sure--and so soon--that another ant is dead. One scientist recently came up with a way to explain this ant behaviour. Dong-Hwan Choe is a biologist, a scientist who studies animals and plants. He found that ants have a chemical on the outside of their bodies that signals to other ants, \"I'm dead--take me away\" when it is dead. But there's a question to answer: As we know, if an ant is dead, it stops moving. But when an ant is sleeping or knocked unconscious, it is also not moving. However, other ants don't move the living ant out of the nest. How do they know this ant is not dead? Choe found that ants have another chemical on their bodies, which tells nearby ants something like, \"Wait--I'm not dead yet\" when it is not dead. Choe suspects that when an ant dies, the chemical that says, \"Wait I'm not dead yet\" quickly goes away. When other ants detect the \"dead\" chemical without the \"not dead yet\" chemical, they move away the body. To test his theory , Choe and his team put different chemicals on ants. When the scientists used the \"I'm dead\" chemical, other ants quickly moved the treated ant away. When the scientists used the \"Wait--I'm not dead yet\" chemical, other ants left the treated ant alone. Choe believes this behavior shows that the \"not dead yet\" chemical _ the \"dead\" chemical when picked up by other ants. And that when an ant dies, the \"not dead yet\" chemical fades away. Other nearby ants then detect the remaining \"dead\" chemical and remove the body from the nest.

They measure 3 meters long and weigh up to 2 kilograms. They are pale blue and transparent in color, and get their name from the cube--like shape of their body, Box jellyfish have 6 eyes on all 4 sides of their body, although it is uncertain how they process what they see as they do not have a central nervous system. They also have up to 15 tentacles  growing from each corner of their body that have about 5,000 stinging cells each. Box jellyfish can be found primarily in the coastal waters off Northern Australia as well as throughout the Indo--Pacific. They prefer to live at river mouths. They do not have any organs to breathe, and will sleep on the ocean floor from 3 pm to dawn. Unlike other jellyfish that merely move along with the current, box jellyfish have developed a way to travel wherever they want to go. _ will shoot themselves in a jet-like fashion, reaching speeds of up to 7.4 kilometers per hour. The diet of box jellyfish consists of thing like fish, small animals, and even other jellyfish. They use their venom, a chemical which causes heart, skin, and breath failure, to kill their prey . Since box jellyfish have eyes, some scientists believe that they actively hunt their prey while others insist that they are just passive opportunists that will wait and catch anything that wanders into their tentacles. Box jellyfish are responsible for more human deaths in Australia than snakes, sharks, and salt-water crocodiles combined. It is best to avoid them as most stings  will result in death. Hopefully, humans and box jellyfish can find a way to live with one another while keeping conflicts to a bare minimum. After all, such a unique species of jellyfish deserves to live and grow just as humans do. The text is mainly about   _  .", "subject": ""}

{"answer": 2, "choices": ["The Japanese write the character for tea the same way as we Chinese.", "It was a Chinese Emperor who first found tea very refreshing.", "The word \"the\" was used to describe only the leaf.", "Tea was discovered quite by chance in history."], "question": "The Mandarin Chinese word for \"cha\" is pronounced \"t'e\" in certain Chinese dialects . Also the Malay word for the leaf is\"the\". This word \"the\" was used to describe both the drink and the leaf. The Japanese character for tea is written exactly the same as the Chinese, though pronounced with a slight difference; so these may be the origins of our word tea in the western world. Tea may have been discovered in 2737 BC by Shen Nong, a Chinese Emperor of the San Huang Period(3,000 - 2,700 BC). He was a scholar, the father of agriculture and the inventor of Chinese herbal medicine. One summer day, while visiting a distant place, he and the court stopped to rest and his servants began to boil water for the court to drink. Dried leaves from the nearby bush fell into the boiling water, and made it a brown liquid. The Emperor was interested in the new liquid, drank some, and found it very refreshing. The tree was a wild tea tree, and so, tea was created. The first samples  of tea reached England between 1652 and 1654. Tea was referred to as the China drink, tcha, chaw, tay, tee, and tea and was at first regarded more as a medicine than a fashionable drink. The original English pronunciation of the word tea was \"tay\" and can be traced back to around 1655 when the Dutch introduced both word and beverage to England. The pronunciation \"tee\" also originated in the 1600's but only gained predominance after the late 18th century. By 1650 the Dutch were actively involved in trade throughout the Western world. During that year Peter Stuyvesant brought the first tea to America to the colonists in the Dutch settlement of New Amsterdam (later re-named New York).

All the people have to face a choice: either ignore the development of the language and spend the rest of our lives wishing Shakespeare were alive, or keep pace with the Internet age, welcoming the new English which someone has once called Weblish. \"you can't avoid it for the simple reason that wherever a new language comes along, it surely impacts   the language as a whole,\" says Dr David Crystal, a famous language professor at the University of Wales. However, there is great trouble with keeping up with the new English because there are so many new words and the old ones no longer mean what we thought they did. In the past if someone said they didn't have \"Windows\", you would have to suppose they lived in a cave without windows. But now, it is probably because they use a Mac, which is a computer. Spam, which once meant a not-so-good-kind of canned meat, now stands for unwanted \"junk  \" email. Spelling is changing too. Weblish loves to see nouns happily become verbs ( for example, \"Please bookmark this site\"), and verbs become nouns (\"Send me the download\").Verbs and prepositions are regularly thrown together to become new nouns or adjectives(for example, dial-up, logon, print-out, pull-down, upload), while others are created from a simple pairing of nouns: cyberspace, ethernet, Internet, hyperlink, metatag and netspeak.

No, the English, too, pay more attention to their pets. This can clearly be seen when we look at pet foods, which often contain more vitamins than human food. They certainly cost much. Last year the British public spent two hundred million pounds on pet food alone, to say nothing of veterinary bills or animal furniture. It is difficult not to feel angry about this when considering what the same amount could do for victims of starvation and poverty, so it is not unusual for me _ when I read an old man left all his money to his dog instead of his children.

Robots do exist today, but mostly in factories and other Manufacturing environments. Back in the 1950s, however, people said that by now personal robots would be in most people's home.

The technology worked fine, but it overlooked something obvious: peoples desire for privacy. Would you want to have a video phone conversation with someone after you just stepped out of the shower? Probably not - it could be embarrassing! Just because a technology is available doesn't always mean people will want to use it. And finally, how about that crazy prediction of the flying car?

Regular X-rays can show a lot. CAT scans can show even more. They can give three-dimensional  view of body organs . What is a CAT scan? CAT stands for Computerized Axial Tomography(X). It is a special X-ray machine that gets a 360 - degree picture of a small area of a patient's body. Doctors use X-rays to study and examine diseases and injuries within the body. X-rays can find foreign objects inside the body or to take pictures of some organs inside if special things as dyes or special liquids are added to the organs to be X-rayed. A CAT scanner, however, uses a beam  of X-rays to give a cross-sectional view of a particular part of the body. A fine beam of X-rays is scanned across the body and circled around the patient from many different angles . A computer analyzes  the information from each angle and produces a clear cross-sectional picture on the screen. This picture is then photographed for later use. Several cross-sections, taken one after another, can give a clear \"photo\" of the entire body or of any body organs. The newest CAT scanners can even give a clear picture of active, moving organs just as a fast-action camera can \"stop the action\" giving clear pictures of what appear only mistily  to the eye. And because of the 360 - degree pictures, CAT scans show 3-dimensional views of organs in a manner that was once only seen during surgery or autopsy (examining a dead body).

The bikes are painted bright yellow so people know they can take them. When people take a yellow bike, they can ride to work or to shopping areas, and then leave the bike for the next rider. Some people worry that the free bikes will be stolen. However, theft hasn't been a problem in other free-bike cities. While most people think the bike program is a good idea, only a few say they will use it. \"I will still drive my car,\" says Joanna Greene. \"San Franciscohas a lot of hills. My office is at the top of Potrero Hill. I don't think _ . And, wouldn't I have to carry a helmet with me all the time?\" Phil Chung agrees, \"There is too much traffic. Riding a bicycle can be dangerous. There are not very many bike lanes .\" He continues, \"Plus, it's too cold in the winter. And what if you ride a bike to work, and then there isn't one to ride home?\" Program leaders know there will be problems. But they think it's worth trying. \"It's not the solution for everyone,\" states Sylvia Pass. \"But if just one hundred people use it every day, that's one hundred cars that aren't on the streets, one hundred parking spaces that aren't used. I think it's a great beginning.\" The program leaders think the program is worth trying NOT because   _   .", "subject": ""}

I have always had a weakness for old people; they break my heart, especially the ones begging on the streets, or selling flowers, I feel sad for them, having to be on the streets instead of being taken care of by their families or the government.               There was a car in front of us before we reach next to him. I had prepared money in my hand to give it to him, and I was looking at the car in front of us when the driver took a bill of money and threw it off the window--he threw it in the face of the old man and it fell on the ground, in a wet spot. The old man looked at the bill with a sad look, knowing it would take him an enormous effort to pick it up and he was hardly standing up, so I opened the car door, ran to him as he was bending to pick it up, took it, wiped it with my jeans since it was almost wet, gave it to him and gave him the money I had prepared for him.

Oswald, Bugs, and hundreds of other characters were created by Walt Disney, perhaps the most famous cartoonist in history. Born in prefix = st1 /Chicagoin 1901, Walt Disney always wanted to be an artist. After returning from World War I, in which he drove an ambulance, Disney worked as a commercial artist. He enjoyed drawing cartoons more than anything else, and decided to try his hand at a technology that was new at the time, moving pictures. In the 1920's, he produced several films where he made cartoon characters move as if by magic. The technique Disney used was painstaking. He made hundreds or even thousands of repeated drawings of the same character. In each drawing, the character was changed just a bit. A film was taken of the series of drawings, and when it was shown, the characters appeared to move. The process, called animation, is still used today, although computers have made the process much easier. In 1928, Disney created his most famous character, Mortimer Mouse, who we know today as Mickey. The mouse starred in a cartoon called Steamboat Willie, which was unusual because it involved the use of a sound track. Within the next few years, Disney invented many of his other characters. The list of Disney's animation successes is long and memorable. It includes Pinocchio, Dumbo, Bambi, Cinderella, and Peter Pan. Perhaps his most remarkable animated film is Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs. Created in 1937, it was an immediate success.

It is said that emotional intelligence makes up 80 percent of one's success. Ever since the 1995 publication of US writer Daniel Goleman's best-seller, Emotional Intelligence: Why It Can Matter More Than IQ, EQ has been seen by leaders and educators as the solution to many social problems. In some Western countries such as the US, emotional intelligence is now taught widely in secondary, business and medical schools. EQ is important. But our enthusiasm for it has hidden a dark side, says a recent article in The Atlantic. Recent research and studies show that as people improve their emotional skills, they become better at manipulating   others. When someone knows what others are feeling, they can motivate them to act against their own best interests. Does this remind you of those \"managers\" at pyramid scheme   companies? Hundreds of thousands of otherwise cautious and rational   people have been brainwashed by their impassioned speeches and become bankrupt as a result. Social scientists have begun to document this dark side of emotional intelligence. A study by the University of Cambridge found that when a leader gave an inspiring speech filled with emotion, the audience was less likely to look over the message and remembered less of the content. Researchers call this the \"awestruck effect\"  , but it may just as easily be described as the dumbstruck effect, says The Atlantic article. Leaders who master emotions can rob us of our ability to reason.

Unfortunately, only very few can hope to become famous and successful. Talent is not enough, because show business is as competitive as any other business .Without a good manager ,a performer can never hope to succeed .Fashion is important in this business, too. The best tailor in the world will never be a success if he makes old-fashioned clothes. In exactly the same way, a performer must change his \"act\" in order to follow the taste of the moment. This is true for actors, dancers and comedians, but perhaps most of all singers. \"Pop\" stands for \"popular\" and a pop singer has to work very hard to become popular .He must either give the public what they already want, or he must find a new way of singing that will attract their attention.

Sensitivity to the child's nonverbal   signals is basic to the growth and development of language. If the mother seldom responds to her child's signals,   _  .", "subject": ""}

He was a businessman and he had been in business in Japan for many years. Once he gave me a great surprise.

The idea of an amusement park grew in Walt's mind as he traveled through the US and Europe and visited attractions of all kinds. Walt was sure that an amusement park would be successful in the United States if it offered a \"good show\" that families could enjoy together, was clean, and had friendly employees. In 1948 he shared his concept with trusted friends, a modest amusement park with a central village including a town hall, a small park, railroad station movie theater, and small stores. Outlying areas would include a carnival   area and a western village. Soon he added spaceship and submarine rides, a steamboat, and exhibit halls. Four years later, he decided on \"Disneyland\" for the name and formed a company to develop the park, Disneyland, Inc. In 1953 he got Stanford Research Institute to examine the economic future of Disneyland and to find the perfect location. They broke ground in July, 1954, and one year later, Disneyland opened.

His father, Lin Jianbin, said \"Super Dan\"has waited for four years to get this championship and he felt very proud of his son, as well as his prospective daughter-in-law Xie Xingfang, who is also a badminton player and won silver in women's singles at the Beijing Games. An SMS: The beginning of a love story Lin was born in Shanghang County, Longyan in Fujian Province. He first met Xie Xingfang when he was 14-years-old. 16-year-old Xie was attending a national youth team badminton training camp in Jinjiang, Fujian and Lin was also there. Tall and beautiful, Xie became the Snow White in the heart of Lin Dan, and he tried to please her and get chances to chat with her after the training sessions. He did not go beyond that. Before the Spring Festival in 2004, Lin finally mustered(,) the courage and sent Xie Xingfang a text message - I LOVE YOU. In fact, Xie Xingfang had already realized Lin Dan was fond of her. And covertly  , she began to pay attention to Lin's movement and performance on the court. \"He is very interesting, got a lot of ideas, and is a lovely boy.\" Two Kisses In May 2004 at the Thomas Cup in Jakarta, their love relationship was first known to the public. Xie sat with her teammates and watched the men's team playing. When Lin Dan won the match, he rushed to the bench and kissed Xie, a move that Xie did not expect Lin to do in public. A photographer captured this moment. At the All England Open in 2007, Lin kissed her again in public, making Xie feel like the happiest woman in the world. After Lin won his third title at the Open, he did not stay to watch Xie play. Xie defeated her opponent and won the championship. When she was called to accept the trophy(,) , Lin suddenly emerged at the central venue, holding red roses and gave her the flowers, and a passionate kiss. Nine Roses Earlier, on February 14, 2006, Lin and Xie were with the national badminton teams at a training camp in Jinjiang. The teams had their rules - not going out of the training camp. Xie thought she would spend the Valentine's Day without flowers. But Lin still managed to give her a surprise - giving her a Dior wallet as a Valentine's gift and nine roses. With the teams' rule in place, Lin asked his local friend to buy the roses and gave her a pleasant Valentines surprise.

In fact, Lin Dan has already prepared for this. He has bought a 200-square-meter apartment in downtown Beijing, with 4 rooms and 2 living rooms. Paying about 20,000 yuan per square meter for the apartment, it is reported the apartment is now valued at 8 million yuan. \"After the Olympics, we really want to live our own lives, go on vacation, go to school, get married, I am really looking forward to it,\" Xie said happily.

{"answer": 0, "choices": ["Diet", "Appearance", "Reproduction", "Hunting"], "question": "The great white shark is the largest shark and is probably the most well-known and feared shark. The great white shark is gray or bluish above and white below. The largest Great Whites can reach lengths of 22 feet and weigh up to 5,000 pounds. The Great White has massive teeth, which are positioned in rows. When the Great White attacks, it bites its prey and shakes its head back and forth. The serrated teeth act as a saw and literally tear the victim apart. Actually the Great White Shark often swallows many of its own teeth in an attack. Great Whites employ several hunting skills depending on the prey. Most of the time, the shark will remain still underwater before attacking its prey from underneath. In the case of hunting some kinds of seals, the impact of the shark is so powerful that it knocks both the shark and the seal clear out of the water. With larger prey such as elephant seals, the shark will simply take a huge bite out of it and wait for it to bleed to death. When hunting dolphins, the shark will attack from above, to avoid detection from the dolphin's echolocation. Interestingly, a Great White Shark has never been observed giving birth. However, pregnant females have been caught. The Great White Shark is known to be ovoviviparous. Females give birth to eight or nine pups that are already about five feet in length upon birth, which is different from other egg-laying animals. Despite the fear of Great White Sharks, at least in part generated by Steven Spielberg's 1975 movie, Jaws, Great White Sharks do not target humans as prey. Most attacks are attributed to mistaken identity. Sharks can easily mistake humans for seals. Many human injuries caused by Great White Sharks are cases of test-biting. If a shark is unsure about a floating object, it often gives it test bite to determine what kind of object it is. While such bites do little damage to buoys  and other objects, they obviously can cause serious damage on the human body. Which aspect is not mentioned in the passage?", "subject": ""}

Established in the early years of the 20th century by settlers from China, its tiny            shops and restaurants serve locals and visitors.

I came to the Driver's License Office half an hour earlier _ , pacing back and forth on the worn porch waiting for the office to open at eight. I reviewed the driver's manual for the hundredth time. I was ready. I knew the manual backward and forward; I had made an \"A\" in my driver's training course, and I was a genius behind the wheel. Finally, the door opened and a weary-looking man in a brown uniform let me in. \"Let me guess. You want to take the driver's test.\" his voice was not enthusiastic. \"Yes!\" I answered in excitement. \"Ok, fill this out, and if you pass we'll go for a drive.\"  _ . A quick check showed that my paper was perfect. \"Let's get in the car.\" He tossed me a set of keys, and I slid behind the wheel. Everything was going smoothly as we pulled out of the empty parking lot. I signaled a right hand turn, and we were on a deserted street. This was going to be easy. \"Turn left and go up Young Blood Hill,\" he ordered. My hometown is in the mountains, and Young Blood Hill was almost vertical  . As I eased up the steep hill and came to a stop at the top, I heard the car's engine die. My heart sank. I would have to start it again without rolling back down the hill. I swallowed hard and turned the key; as I moved my foot from the brake, the car began to roll. I suppose I could have rolled all the way back to the bottom except for one thing. There was something behind me which stopped my roll with a rough shake and crash of glass--a police car. The policeman wrote me a ticket as I looked over the damage, and the man from the Driver's License Office slid behind the wheel. I waited until we had parked before I asked how long a person had to wait before taking the test again. Why didn't the car roll back to the bottom?", "subject": ""}

The experiment lasted a month and by the end of the study scientists managed to discover that tomato plants grew up two inches taller when women gardeners talked to them instead of male. Sarah Darwin was the one making the plants registered the best growth. Her voice was the most \"inspiring\" for plants than those of nine other gardeners when reading a passage from The Origin of Species. The great-great-granddaughter of the famous botanist  Charles Darwin found that her plant grew about two inches taller than the plant of the best male gardener. Colin Crosbie, Garden Superintendent at RHS, said that the finding cannot yet be explained. He assumes that women have a greater range of pitch  and tone  which might have a certain effect on the sound waves that reach the plant. \" _ ,\"said Mr Grosbie. The study began in April at RHS Garden Wisley in Survey. Scientists started with open auditions  for the people who were asked to record passages from John Wyndham's The Day of the Triffids, Shakespeare's A Midsummer's Night Dream and Darwin's The Origin of Species.[:Z,xx,k.Com] Afterwards researchers selected a number of different voices and played them to 10 tomato plants during a period of a month.

{"answer": 0, "choices": ["painting displays universal qualities", "painting is thought to be artistic", "painting is similar to music and dance", "painting has been practiced for some 20,000 years."], "question": "Painting, the execution of forms and shapes on a surface by means of pigment  , has been continuously practiced by humans for some 20,000 years. Together with other activities that may have been ritualistic   but have come to be considered as artistic   (such as music or dance), painting was one of the earliest ways in which man sought to express his own personality and his emerging understanding of an existence beyond the material world. Unlike music and dance, however, examples of early forms of painting have survived to the present day. And painting, like other arts, exhibits universal qualities that make it easy for viewers of all nations and civilizations to understand and appreciate. The major extant examples of early painting anywhere in the world are found in Western Europe and the Soviet Union. But some 5,000 years ago, the areas in which important paintings were executed shifted to the Eastern Mediterranean Sea and neighboring regions. Therefore, Western shared a European cultural tradition ----the Middle East and Mediterranean Basin and, later, the countries of the New World. Western painting is in general distinguished by its concentration on the representation of the human figure, whether in the heroic context of antiquity   or the religious context of the early Christian and medieval   world. The Renaissance extended this tradition through a close examination of the natural world and an investigation of balance, harmony, and perspective in the visible world, linking painting to the developing sciences of anatomy   and optics  .

Now l saw no point in sitting around worrying when we could see the country. We'd take our kids, Aidan, 11, Charlie, 8, and Rosie ,6, out of school and teach them on the road. It was the perfect time, before they reached high school. Michael resisted at first but realized that with his cell phone and computer, he could work anywhere.               We listed our house for rent and got a great deal on an RV . I created a website for us familyofftrack. com--and secured five major sponsors, including Geico and Encore campgrounds. Their ads on our site would help bear the travel cost , and we'd promote their brands.               All spring and summer, we visited treasured lands, our first stop was Springfield, Illinois, home of Abraham Lincoln. In the south, we drove along the Natchez Trace, lined with Civil War history. At Bandelier national monument, we climbed ladders up to the ancient cliff dwellings of native Americans. And we took swims in Oregon' s rivers. we kept a video blog; Aidan added the music. Rosie made a slide show of photos, while Charlie put receipts in a folder.               By the end of August ,we were ready to return home. Michael's company continued to slide.

It's no accident that boys tend to create pictures of moving objects instead of drawing the happy color1ful family,as girls do in class. The female eye,on the other hand,is drawn to warmer color1s like red, yellow and orange. To attract girls, Chadwell says, the teacher doesn't need to move as much as in boys' class.

As Griffith tried to remove the car,its headlights attracted the attention of a passerby,Jordan Ricks,a college student.He ran over.      Ricks,22,tried to appear calm as he instructed Gdmth to remove the car.Both of them could now see the wheel between the rails and the uneven track bed.Ricks put his hands under the front fender  and gave it a push.It didn't move.     He pushed it again with all his strength,Still,no movement.      From about 50 feet away,a group of students from the nearby university watched the scene.Ricks signaled to them,and five of the guys came over.     He directed them to different sides of the car,and they all put their hands under the flame. \"One,two,three\" Ricks yelled.They all pushed.     \"One,two,three!\" he yelled again.The car didn't move.     At that moment,they felt the ground begin to shake.Then four dings  signaled an on coming train,apd the railroad gates dropped down.In the distance,an unclear line of light appeared,followed by the loud noise of a horn  .

Sure, Mom. shed say, shrugging. Marina was more excited about getting a tattoo  on her ankle to represent my fight with ALS  than trying on $ 10,000 wedding gowns. My sister, Stephanie, had arranged for a car with a wheelchair lift to drive us from the hotel to Kleinfeld. The car driver wheeled me in. At Kleinfeld with flower arrangements ten feet high, I felt like rolling into a dream. \"Wow!\" I said. I was wearing a new black outfit. Marina wore jean shorts, a sleeveless  shirt, and sneakers. _ . The kind Kleinfeld ladies pointed out rooms like tour guides, naming the designers one by one on display: Alita Grham, Pnina Tornai... With Marina walking beside me, Stephanie pushed my chair up and down rows and rows of dresses that made Princess Diana's dress look modest. Marina didn't say a word. We turned a corner into the storage room, where hundreds of dresses hung in plastic protector sleeves. Marina and I were overwhelmed. \"Want to try one on ?\" I said, touching Marina's hand. \"OK,\" Marina said in her sharp, unsure voice. \"Tell them the style you'd like.\" Marina stood silent. I felt bad for bringing her, for forcing such an adult experience on a child. Marina picked an A-line dress. Or, more precisely, the ladies of Kleinfeld picked it for her. Marina was too shocked to do more than nod. As she took the gown into the dressing room, I tried not to think of my little girl on her wedding day or of her as a baby in my arms. I tried not to think of her with her own baby in her arms one day. I tried not to think of Marina right now, embarrassed by her mother's plans, by things she could not and should not yet understand. I am leaving money in my will for Marina's wedding dress. Stephanie has promised to bring her back to Kleinfeld to purchase it. \"No pure white!\" I said to Stephanie. \"Ivory. Not too much tulle . Think lace.\" \"Think royalty when picking a dress,\" I advised Steph as we waited outside the dressing room. \"Think Princes Kate. Elegant. Think long sleeves. They make dresses more formal.\" Marina came out, sleeveless, flared . She looked like a 14-year-old girl in the middle of a giant cupcake. \"I don't like the loose gown.\" she said. That's my girl! \"How about trying on one with long sleeves?\" I asked her. The ladies brought out a dress with long lace sleeves, an Empire collar, a ruched  fitted waist, and a long, smooth silk skirt. Marina disappeared into the dressing room. When the door opened, she looked a foot taller and a decade older. I could clearly see the beautiful woman she will be one day. I simply stared. What do you do when you glimpse a moment you will not live to see? I dipped my head. Breathe, I told myself. I looked up. I smiled. Marina smiled back. I worked my tongue into position to speak. \"I like it,\" I said. In that dress, Marina stood straight, shining brightly, and tall. \"You are beautiful,\" I whispered, my tongue barely cooperating. I don't know if she heard me. We took some photos. And moved on. A memory made. What would be the best title for the passage?", "subject": ""}

{"answer": 2, "choices": ["To describe her sad memories in Hong Kong.", "To attract more tourists to visit Hong Kong.", "To express her deep love to Hong Kong. ks5u", "To give readers some advice on travling."], "question": "What can you say about a vibrant  city that I once called home? Is she beautiful or brilliant? Do these lines sound familiar to you? If you have read the book or seen the movie 'Love Story' you would know that my opening lines are 'inspired' from it. And it fits!     I fell in love with Hong Kong at first sight! It's the city where I set up our first home, raised our son, and studied my MBA. Our first encounter was in October 2010, when my husband and I were there for a week to visit the city we would be calling home for the next few years. Once we entered the city, what impressed us was its vibrancy and almost immediately I was convinced to make that city our home. A few months later, we settled down and I loved everything about Hong Kong! The wet markets, the modern shopping malls, the bargaining at Mongkok, the fine foods...there is so much to experience.  Then came the MBA, which took the entire experience to a different level. I was so nervous about returning to books after almost a decade. I thought I would struggle a lot with the academic requirements. But, I made it. I am so happy to have so many good memories to write in this blog. One thing for which I will always be grateful is the opportunity to travel. And Hong Kong gave me plenty of that. I feel enriched just having visited some of the neighboring countries.      I am living in another city that I love----London now. However, Hong Kong, for all its sights and smells, was once home to me and my family. I WILL MISS YOU!

{"answer": 1, "choices": ["the misunderstanding of the word bug", "the development of the word bug", "the public views of the word bug", "the special characteristics of the word bug"], "question": "\"Indeed,\" George Washington wrote in his diary in 1985, \"some kind of fly, or bug, had begun to eat the leaves before I left home.\" But the father of America was not the father of bug. When Washington wrote that, Englishmen had been referring to insects as bugs for more than a century, and Americans had already created lighining-bug . But the English were soon to stop using the bugs in their language, leaving it to the Americans to call a bug a bug in the nineteenth and twentieth centuries. The American bug could also be a person, referring to someone who was crazy about a particular activity. Althoug fan became the usual term. sports fans used to be called racing bugs, baseballbugs, and the like. Or the bug could be a small machine or object, for example, a bug-shaped car. The bug could also be a burglar alarm, from which comes the expression to bug, that is, \"to install   an alarm\". Now it means a small piece of equipment that people use for listening secretly to others' conversation. Since the 1840s, to bug has long meant \"to cheat\", and since the 1940s it has been annoying. We also know the bug as a _ in a computer program or other design. That meaning dates back to the time of Thomas Edison. In 1878 he explained bugs as \"little problems and difficulties\" that required months of study and labor to overcome in developing a successful product. In 1889 it was recorded that Edison \"had been up the two previous nights discovering 'a bug' in his invented record player.\" The passage is mainly concerned with  _  .", "subject": ""}
