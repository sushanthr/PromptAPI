It is the stuff of nightmares for those whose busy work schedule or busy family life means getting up early and staying up late. Scientists claim that the modern tendency to delay going to bed in order to get through more of the items on the 'to do' list has serious health consequences. But take care. Those who have too much sleep are also more likely to suffer a heart attack. While the extra sleeping is unlikely to be the cause, long-term illnesses such as heart disease often make sufferers feel tired, so sleeping for longer than nine hours a night may be an early warning sign.    Researchers found that those who slept for less than six hours were almost 50 per cent more likely to suffer a heart attack and 15 per cent more at risk of strokes. They believe that not having enough sleep disrupts the balance of two key hormones , ghrelin and leptin , which control the appetite. Poor sleepers tend to eat more and are more likely to be fatter, so are at greater risk of high blood pressure and heart disease, which lead to heart attacks and strokes. Experts recommend adults get at least six or seven hours' shut-eye a night to stay healthy.     But as many as 60 per cent of us do not think we are sleeping enough, with a third suffering from sleeplessness. The researchers, from the University of Warwick, warned that trying to push too much into one day by going to bed late and getting up early could lead to serious illnesses later in life. They looked at the sleeping habits of almost 475,000 participants from 15 previous studies across eight countries, including the UK, the U.S., Japan, Sweden and Germany. Their findings, published in the European Heart Journal, show that those who slept for less than six hours were 48 per cent more likely to develop or die from heart disease and 15 per cent more likely to develop or die from a stroke. Not having enough sleep decreases the levels of leptin in our blood, which means we do not feel as satisfied after eating. At the same time, it raises the levels of ghrelin, responsible for triggering  our appetite, thus making us feel hungrier.

Almost everyone is wondering, \"What happens to all my money? I never seem to have anything left to put away.\"       Why isn't a dollar worth as much as it used to be? One dollar is always worth the same amount, that is, 100 cents. But the value of a dollar is how much it can buy. The value of money depends on the cost of living. Economists say that the cost of living is the money that a family must pay for the necessities of life such as food, housing or rent, clothes and medical expenses. For many years now the cost of living has increased greatly, so the value of the dollar has decreased. When a dollar has a low value, you cannot buy as many things with it.       No one fully understands why the cost of living keeps increasing, but economists believe that workers and producers can make prices go up. As workers earn more money, they have more money to spend, so they demand more goods. If there is a great demand for certain goods, the prices of these goods go up. At the same time, if there's a shortage of goods, the price also goes up. For example, if everyone wants to buy more and more gas, the price of gas goes up. When companies withhold gas from buyers, they can also make the price of gas go up.       Families need to know what happens to their money. They need to make their income meet the cost of living, so many people plan a family budget. A budget is a list of monthly expenses. If your expenses add up to more than your income, you must find ways to save money. Maybe you're spending too much on entertainment.

He leads a typical  American way of life, except for one thing-he looks exactly like the President, Bill Mitchell. In fact, the only thing that makes him different from the nation's leader is that he is very nice! The president has started using look-alikes during some public appearances. Dave is offered a chance to \"serve his country\" by becoming _ . However, things go wrong. The President becomes very ill and Dave ends up acting as the President forever. Director Ivan Reitman, who made the popular and successful comedies like Twins, Ghostbusters and Legal Eagles, could have gone for easy laughs by making fun of the American government. Instead, Dave is an attractive comedy about an ordinary man in extraordinary situations. Kevin Kline gives a double performance as Dave and the President, and Sigourney Weaver is at her best as his First Lady. The love story that develops between her role and Dave is a real classic . The film is 100% American. However, if you've ever felt that anybody could do a better job running the country than the people in power, then you'll enjoy Dave!

What makes this aquarium special, however, is not just its size, but also its design. The Atoll Reef is built with an observation passageway that circles the aquarium on four different levels. This lets visitors view sea life from a variety of depths and angles. Then there's the Shark Aquarium, a tank with more than 200 sharks from more than 30 species.  Like the Atoll Reef, this unique aquarium is designed to make sure guests get the most out of their visit. Shaped like an underwater tunnel, guests can watch as sharks swim overhead and dive at them from every side. There's also the Sea Jelly Spectacular, an aquarium that houses more than 1,000 jellyfish of all shapes, colours and sizes. And at the park's Dolphin University, visitors can go on educational tours and watch the training of dolphins up close. The park's most popular attraction is the Ocean Theatre, a huge outdoor pool where dolphins and sea lions entertain the visitors. Sometimes a killer whale even takes part in the performance! Although Ocean Parks focus is on the water, the theme park has plenty of other activities, too. For people seeking excitement, there are rides like the Abyss Turbo Drop, a roller coaster ride that takes passengers on a 20-storey drop straight down. There are also exhibits like the Dinosaur Discovery Trail and Bird Paradise. Finally, no trip to Ocean Park would be complete without visiting the park's most popular animals--four giant pandas that were given as a gift from China's central government.

I had lost the sight in one eye at the age of five, so instead of football, I put my energy into rowing and sailing. By the time I was 22, I was working towards rowing for my country. Then, during a training session, I noticed my vision was unclear in my remaining eye. I had an operation and spent two weeks with bandages over my eyes. Sadly, it didn't work, and the second operation two months later was also a failure. My world came crashing down. I had been flying high---- as well as my shining rowing career, I had been about to take my finals and get a job in the city. Now, as my fellow graduates celebrated their results, I lay in my childhood bedroom, angry. I would wake up in the morning and convince myself I could see a shadow, but I felt bitterly angry when I realized I couldn't. Previously, I had lots of assumptions about blind people, but now I joined their ranks. I had no choice but to change my attitude. I started to realize that my challenge was not about seeing but about creating a new life for myself. The simple pleasure of just sitting in a cafe and watching the world go by or even making eye contact with anyone is no longer possible. I had to rethink how to engage with the world. As much as I disliked the things of blindness---- white sticks, talking computers and guide dogs---- I welcomed these as the tools that would enable me to regain my independence. I moved out of my mum's house and got a job in entertainment. I also started seeking out projects that would help me get out and mix with people. A big part of my identity has always been about the thrill of competing---- success and failure. I am excited when I am giving it my all, so I started to compete again, first in rowing and then in extreme physical challenges such as completing six marathons in seven days in Gobi desert. Filling my life with experiences helped to sweep the blindness to one side. It took me 10 years really to deal with losing my sight. When I walked to the South Pole in 2009, the first blind person ever to go there, standing shoulder to shoulder with sighted people, I felt \"normal\" again. But two years ago, my sense of \"being normal\" was challenged again. I was staying at a friend's house when I fell out of a second-floor window onto the ground below. I have no idea how it happened---- I was just going to bed but ended up waking up in hospital. I hurt my brain, and my back in three places. I discovered that I couldn't feel my legs. Doctors said that there was a 12-week period for sensation  to return, and when this came and went with no change in my legs, I began to despair. I was due to get married, but on the day of our wedding my fiancee  was sitting by my bedside as I prepared for another operation to put metalwork in my back. I'm still in a wheelchair, but I refuse to accept that my story ends here. I have got involved with a training program, which aims to redirect the nerve pathways in my legs through training.

Few of us are content to accept ourselves as we are, and few are brave enough to ignore the trends of fashion. Most fashion magazines or TV advertisements try to persuade us that we should dress in a certain way or behave in a certain manner. If we do, they tell us, we will be able to meet new people with confidence and deal with every situation confidently and without embarrassment. Changing fashion, of course, does not apply just to dress. A barber today does not cut a boy's hair in the same way as he used to, and girls do not make up in the same way as their mothers and grandmothers did. The advertisers show us the latest fashionable styles and we are constantly under pressure to follow the fashion in case our friends think we are odd or dull. What causes fashions to change? Sometimes convenience or practical necessity or just the fancy of an influential person can establish a fashion. Take hats for example. In cold climates, early buildings were cold inside, so people wore hats indoors as well as outside. In recent times, the late President Kennedy caused a depression in the American hat industry by not wearing hats, and more American men followed his example. There is also a cyclical  pattern in fashion. In the 1920s in Europe and America, short skirts became fashionable. After World War II, they dropped to ankle length. Then they got shorter and shorter until the miniskirt was in fashion. After a few more years, skirts became longer again. Today, society is much freer and easier than it used to be. It is no longer necessary to dress like everyone else. Within reason, you can dress as you like or do your hair the way you like instead of the way you should because it is the fashion. The popularity of jeans and the \"untidy\" look seems to be a reaction against the increasingly expensive fashion of the top fashion houses.

Joining a club or a group, talking with those who like the same things as you do is much easier. Or join someone in some activity. Many people are nervous when talking to new people. After all meeting strangers means facing the unknown. And it's human nature to feel a bit uncomfortable about unknown. Most of our fears about dealing with new people comes from doubts about ourselves. We imagine other people are judging us, finding us too tall or too short, too this or too that. But don't forget that they must be feeling the same way. Try to accept yourself as you are, and try to put the other person at ease. You'll both feel more comfortable. Try to act self-confident even if you don't feel that way. When you enter a room full of strangers, such as a new classroom, walk tall and straight, look directly at other people and smile. If you see someone you'd like to speak to, say something. Don't wait for the other person to start a conversation. Just meeting someone new does not mean that you will make friends with that person--friendship is based on mutual liking and \"give and take\". It takes time and effort to develop.

Analysts are busy debating which of the phones giants --Apple, Samsung or Xiaomi -- leads the Chinese market. But too few people spare a thought to environmental damage caused by cell phones. Indeed, smartphones are great innovative tools, but they also make people change phones that are as good as new, and thus worsen the already serious environmental pollution. Theoretically, a cell phone can be used for eight years, but in practice one lasts 15 months on average in China, according to D. Phone. From production to disposal, cell phones, even those made by big brands like Apple and Samsung, pollute the environment. A study by the Ecology Center of Ann Arbor, Michigan, and ifixit.com showed that each of the 36 dissected phone models contained at least one of the following poisonous elements: lead, bromine, chlorine, mercury and cadmium. And these poisonous elements are linked to birth defects, impaired learning and other serious health problems. China, the largest phone-making country and smartphone market, should be alarmed by the environment damage caused by cell phones. So there is no reason to celebrate the \"good news\" that last year China produced about 1.46 billion cell phones, about 81.1 percent of the total global output, and 340 million smartphones were sold in the country -- a figure that is expected to cross 400 million this year. In fact, Apple's production chain best shows the urgency for China's manufacturing sector to climb up the global value chain. Apple products are designed in the US, assembled in China and sold across the world. And while Apple takes away the lion's share of the profits, Chinese workers can barely manage to keep their pots boiling and the environment ends up paying the heaviest price.

In dreams, a window opens into a world where there is zero logic and dead people can speak. A century ago, Freud formulated  his revolutionary theory that dreams were the hidden shadows of our unconscious desires and fears; by the late 1970s, neurologists  had switched to thinking of them as just \"mental noise\"--the random byproducts  of the neural repair work that goes on during sleep. Now researchers suspect that dreams are regulating moods while the brain is \"offline\". And one leading authority says that these intensely powerful mental events actually can be bought under conscious control, to help us sleep and feel better. \"It's your dream,\" says Rosalind Cartwright, chair of psychology at Chicago's Medical Center. \"If you don't like it, change it.\" Evidence from brain imaging supports this view. The brain is as active during rapid eye movement sleep when most vivid dreams occur as it is when fully awake, says Dr. Eric Nofzinger at the University of Pittsburgh. But not all parts of the brain are equally involved: the limbic system or the emotional brain is especially active, while the prefrontal cortex--the center of intellect and reasoning, is relatively quiet. \"We wake up from dreams happy or depressed, and those feelings can stay with us all day,\" says Stanford sleep researcher Dr. William Dement. This link is shown among the patients in Cartwright's clinic. Most people seem to have more bad dreams early in the night, progressing toward happier ones before awakening, suggesting that they are working through negative feelings generated during the day. Because our conscious mind is occupied with daily life we don't always think about the emotional significance of the day's events--until, it appears, we begin to dream. There is probably little reason to pay attention to our dreams at all unless they keep us from sleeping or \"We wake up in a panic,\" Cartwright says.

The car is intended as a four-wheeled friend. It aims to provide affection, sympathy and encouragement. Like a dog welcoming its master, the car sits up, wags its tail and acknowledges its owner's presence using hydraulics  and a multi-coloured LED display panel  across the front. While on the road, the car constantly monitors the driver's mood with pulse and sweat  sensors on the joystick . Cameras focused on the eyes keep watch for any sigh of _ . If a driver appears to be losing his or her cool, Pod will display warnings, play soft music and blow cold air at the face. Drivers are shaken awake with loud music and a shaking chair. To improve driving skills, Pod uses a comparison to score drivers, offer advice and rank all Pod owners.

With some terrific computer-generated effects, a great cast and a fun-packed storyline, Robots is the best animated film  since The Incredibles. Yep, it really is that good. Set in a world populated by robots, Ewan McGregor plays Rodney Copperbottom, a young robot who leaves his small-town home to pursue his dream of becoming an inventor. But after arriving in Robot City, his hopes of getting a job at Bigweld Industries are destroyed when he learns the firm has been taken over by the evil Ratchet (Greg Kinnear). Egged on by his controlling mum, Madame Gasket (Jim Broadbent), Ratchet plans to reduce half on Robot City's citizens to scrap metal by refusing to sell the spare Pans they need to survive. Instead, he wants to make a fortune selling expensive upgrades that few can afford. As he says, \"Why be you when you can be new?\" Aided by a few misfit robots known as the Rustles-including Robin Williams as the cowardly  Fender (\"I'm made of a metal called Afraidium\")-Rodney must track down the firm's founder, Bigweld (Mel Brooks), and convince him to save the city from Ratchet's plans. The first thing that'll strike you about the movie is the thought that's gone into creating Robot City. It's a wondrous world full of mechanical marvels including wind-up cars and walking streetlamps. Also terrific are the special effects. This might be animated movie but at times you'll catch yourself thinking it's really a live-action film.

While it is usually a healthy source of protein in the diet, there may be several reasons to avoid biting into a forkful of fish. Before you break out the tartar sauce, learn some facts about fish to keep yourself and the environment healthy. Some fish may contain harmful chemicals, which can be the result of both natural causes and water pollution. Mercury is a poisonous chemical, which occurs naturally in oceans and the Earth's crust, but also comes from man-made sources, such as pesticides, burning garbage, and the releasing of fossil fuels. Polychlorinated biphenyls (PCBs), a group of chemicals, can also be found in some fish. These dangerous man-made chemicals were used in many industries until 1977, when they were banned.  PCBs were released or leaked into the air and water and have been transported around the globe. How do mercury and PCBs end up in fish and the food supply? When they are released into the air, they attach themselves to particles. These particles settle on the ground and in the water and are eventually eaten by microscopic organisms. Small fish eat the micro-organisms, and large fish eat the small fish and on up the food chain. Because they can negatively affect your health, the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency advises that kids younger than 15 years old avoid fish that contain high levels of mercury and PCBs. These include shark, swordfish, king mackerel, and tilefish. There are also many types of fish that are good for you, but because of overfishing are in danger of being wiped out. Some are being fished in the wild so much that they cannot reproduce fast enough to survive. Others are being farmed in ways that are not environmentally friendly. These fish include red snapper, Atlantic salmon, blue-fin tuna, and king crab.

The drums were once used for festivals and religious ceremonies and also as a means of communication during wars. Today they give an ear-blasting performance which punches out rhythms with the power to wind you. They're a welcome relief from the Scottish pipers.

The solid 60-minutes show starts as it means to go on. The drums rumble into fever-pitch action as the ten-strong company strike their sticks with startling control.

Not only is this display musically impressive, but the dance is strikingly beautiful.

Huh? A college counselor tells you not to lock into plans? What's that all about? Actually, Nancy isn't the only counselor advising students to take their time in discovering who they are and what they want to do when they get out of college. \"Preparing broadly makes sense to me,\"she explains,\"that the best preparation for a future that's still unfolding is a broad preparation. It shouldn't prevent you from following areas that light you up, but a broad preparation will prepare you for multiple careers. That's important because jobs change more frequently due to changes in technology and business competition. Some jobs that are available today may be on their way out in 10 years. The best thing about preparing broadly is that you get to live in a big world. You avoid getting typecast in a job or business area, and if your job becomes out of date, you can move on.\" Students let the\"next-step mind\"interfere with their learning as well. Many students don't take courses outside their comfort zone for fear it will ruin their GPA (grade point average) and their chances of getting into a certain college.\"You may be reluctant to go outside your areas of strength for fear you'll get a low grade,\"says Nancy.\"But if you think one grade in one class will ruin your chances of admission, you're doing yourself a disservice. Colleges look at a number of factors in addition to grades. Students often think of requirements for colleges as much tighter and narrower than they really are.\" Since colleges work to admit a diverse group of students, the best thing to do is be yourself and explore your options.\"I know of many people in their late 20s who are unhappy in their careers and who regret that they didn't pursue a wider range of interests while in college.\" Her advice to students:\"Think about who you are right now. You have certain preferences. You have areas you like to study. You have certain skills.\"She suggests using interest surveys to help you gain a sense of where your interests and skills can lead you. \"Follow your nose and find a college that will support and encourage you academically and socially.

I was never asked to take part even when one team had a member missing--not out of special cruelty, but because they took it for granted that I would be no good at it. They were right,of course. I would never forget the wonderful evening when something changed. The baseball ended about eight or eight thirty when it grew dark. Then it was the custom of the boys to retire to a little stoop  that stuck out from the candy store on the corner and that somehow had become theirs. No grownup ever sat there or attempted to. There the boys would sit, mostly talking about the games played during the day and of the game to be played tomorrow. Then long silences would fall and the boys would wander off one by one.

Ebola is a deadly virus --about 60 percent of people infected with it have died. How is Ebola doing its harm? When a person becomes infected with Ebola, the virus damages the body's immune   cells, which defend against infection, said a researcher at Lancaster University. But if a person's immune system can stand up to this attack, then he is more likely to survive the disease. The patients that survive it best are those who don't get such a bad disadvantage in immune system. But if the body isn't able to get rid of this attack, then the immune system becomes less able to regulate   itself. This means the immune system is more likely to run out of control, leading to a drop in blood pressure, multi-organ failure and eventually death. What are the common symptoms of the disease? Fever. Headache. Joint and muscle aches. Weakness. Diarrhea. Vomiting. Stomach pain. Lack of appetite. Chills. Rash. Redness in the eyes. Hiccups. Cough. Sore throat. Chest pain. Difficult breathing or swallowing. Bleeding inside and outside of the body. How to prevent the spread of Ebola? Ebola can be spread primarily via direct contact with patients, specifically the blood and fluids of an infected patient. We should avoid contact with infected patients and objects such as clothing, bedding, and needles used by them. Avoid areas where infections have been reported. For now, the disease has only been confirmed in central and West Africa, four cases in America and Europe. Avoid eating wild-caught bush meat. Researchers have suspected that the disease came to humans via animals, probably through the meat of primates . If you're in an area where the disease has been reported, avoid purchasing, eating, or handling wild game to stay on the safe side. Wear protective medical clothing if you're around infected patients. Extreme caution is necessary. Hospital workers must use masks, gloves, goggles, and gowns, which needed to be worn at all times if you're around infected patients. How Do People Survive Ebola? Doctors don't know for certain who will survive Ebola, and there is no specific treatment or cure for the disease. Although in the minority, some people do recover from infection. Our suggestions include: Maintain your electrolytes   and body liquid. Sports drinks can be used. Monitor your blood pressure and control it if necessary.

And realize that life is the best thing and that you have no business taking it for granted. It is so easy to waste our lives, our days, our hours, our minutes. _ . I learned to live many years ago. Something really, really bad happened to me, something that changed my life in ways that, if I had my choice, it would never have been changed at all. And what I learned from it is what, today, seems to be the hardest lesson of all. I learned to love the journey, not the destination. I learned to look at all the good in the world and try to give some of it back because I believed in it, completely and totally. And I tried to do that, in part, by telling others what I had learned. By telling them this: Read in the backyard with the sun on your face. Learn to be happy. And think of life as a deadly illness, because if you do, you will live it with joy and passion as it ought to be lived. What is the author's attitude toward work?", "subject": ""}

It requires you to predict what other road users will do and get ready to react to something unexpected. When alcohol is consumed, it enters your bloodstream and acts as a depressant , damaging eyesight, judgement and co-ordination , slowing down reaction time and greatly increasing the risk of accidents. Even below the drink driving limit, driving will be affected. Alcohol may take a few minutes to be absorbed into the bloodstream and start action on the brain. Absorption rate is increased when drinking on an empty stomach or when consuming drinks mixed with fruit juice. To get rid of alcohol from the body is a very slow process and it is not possible to speed _ up with any measures like taking a shower or having a cup of tea or coffee. The present Road Traffic Ordinance states clearly that the limit of alcohol concentration is: *50 milligrams of alcohol per 100ml of blood; or *22 micrograms of alcohol per 100ml of breath; or *67 milligrams of alcohol per 100ml of urine . Drivers who cause traffic accidents, or who commit a moving traffic offence or are being suspected of drink driving will be tested. Any driver found drinking beyond the limit will be charged. The driver declared guilty may be fined a maximum of HK$25,000 and be sentenced to up to 3 years in prison and punished for 10 driving-offence points; or temporarily banned from driving. The same punishment applies to failing to provide specimens  for breath, blood or urine tests without good excuse. Drink driving is a criminal offence. Be a responsible driver, think before you drink. For the safety of yourself and other road users, never drive after consuming alcohol.

Shoppers seldom complain to the manager or owner of a retail store  , but instead will alert their friends,  s, co-workers and even strangers. Store managers are often the last to hear complaints, and often find out only when their regular customers frequently go to their competitors, according to a study jointly conducted by Verde Group and Wharton School.               \"Storytelling hurts retailers and affects customers,\" said Paula Courtney, President of the Verde Group. \"The store loses the customer, but the shopper must also find a replacement.\" On average, every unhappy customer will complain to at least four others, and will no longer visit the specific store. For every dissatisfied customer, a store will lose up to three more due to negative review. The resulting \"snowball effect\" can be disastrous to retailers.                According to the research, shoppers who bought clothing met with the most problems. Ranked second and third were grocery and electronics customers. The most common complaints include filled parking lots, cluttered   shelves, overloaded racks, out-of-stock items, long check-out lines, and rude salespeople.                During peak shopping hours, some retailers solved parking problems by getting moonlighting   local police to work as parking attendants. Some hired flag wavers to direct customers to empty parking spaces. This guidance completely got rid of the need for customers to circle the parking lot endlessly, and avoided the situation in which several customers eyed the same parking space at the same time.                Retailers can relieve the headaches by redesigning store layouts, pre-stocking sales items, hiring speedy and experienced cashiers, and having sales representatives on hand to answer questions.                Most importantly, salespeople should be good at dealing with different people and especially should be polite with angry customers.                \"Retailers who're helpful and friendly are more likely to smooth over issues than those who aren't so friendly,\" said Professor Stephen Hoch. \"Maybe something as simple as a greeter at the store entrance would help.\"               Customers can also improve future shopping experiences by bringing complaints to the retailer, instead of complaining to the rest of the world. It's impossible for retailers to improve when they have no idea what is wrong. Why are store managers often the last to hear complaints?", "subject": ""}

The excitement rushing through me kept me awake and thinking; I was standing and applauding a woman as she prepared to read. The Harry Potter series was my gateway to my academic adolescence. I was so fascinated by the magic world that my mother began taking me to academic conferences focused on the books. Since 2005, I have attended presentations about the Latin origin of terms and spells, the ancient tales, and the idea of magic. These books opened my eyes to the whole world, and to knowledge itself. They kept my brain working over the summers. More importantly, they helped me adopt the ideas useful in school and beyond, that there is always another way to do something, or to understand an issue.

He was not very clever, but Darwin was good at doing the things that interested him. His father was a doctor, so Darwin was sent to Edinburgh to study medicine, and was planned to follow a medical career. But Charles found the lectures boring. Then his father sent him to Cambridge University to study to be a priest. While at Cambridge, Darwin's interest in zoology and geography grew. Later he got a letter from Robert FitzRoy who was planning to make a voyage around the world on a ship, the Beagle. He wanted a naturalist to join the ship, and Darwin was recommended . That voyage was the start of Darwin's great life. As the Beagle sailed around the world, Darwin began to wonder how life had developed on earth. He began to observe everything. After he was home, he set to work, getting his collection in order. His first great work The Zoology of the Beagle was well received, but he was slow to make public his ideas on the origin of life. Later Darwin and Wallace, another naturalist who had the same opinions as Darwin, produced a paper together. Darwin's great book, On the Origin of Species by Means of Natural Selection (<<>> ) appeared. It attracted a storm. People thought that Darwin was saying they were descended from monkeys. What a shameful idea! Although most scientists agreed that Darwin was right, the Church was still so strong that Darwin never received any honors for his work. Afterwards, he published another great work, The Descent of Man. His health grew worse, but he still worked. \"When I have to give up observation, I shall die,\" he said.

They noticed the lizard's toes were unique: They have suckers  , which enable it to hang on walls. They, therefore, made a robot with suckers on its hands and feet.

Scientists got puzzled: How on earth can the lizard crawl on an extremely smooth wall or even on a ceiling without dropping off?  An accidental finding inspired them: One day a scientist happened to see an animal attack a lizard and bite off its tail. The lizard broke away from the animal's teeth and threw itself on a wall to escape, only to fall off heavily on the ground. The scientist wondered: Is it the tail that plays an important role in its travelling on the wall? He caught some lizards for an experiment. The result proved his assumption: A tailless lizard has no trouble walking on an ordinary wall but can't on a smooth one. A further study showed the lizard's tail can prevent it falling over backward and, what's more, that the tail acts as an additional leg while one of the lizard's legs leaves the wall, which is always the case while it is walking on the wall.

The lizard broke away from the animal's teeth and threw itself on a wall to escape, only to fall off heavily on the ground. The scientist wondered: Is it the tail that plays an important role in its travelling on the wall? He caught some lizards for an experiment. The result proved his assumption: A tailless lizard has no trouble walking on an ordinary wall but can't on a smooth one. A further study showed the lizard's tail can prevent it falling over backward and, what's more, that the tail acts as an additional leg while one of the lizard's legs leaves the wall, which is always the case while it is walking on the wall.

{"answer": 1, "choices": ["helping support the body", "serving as another leg", "sticking to the wall", "stopping slipping"], "question": "Scientists have long had it in their mind to make a robot lizard  . They began with finding out why a lizard can hang on a wall. They noticed the lizard's toes were unique: They have suckers  , which enable it to hang on walls. They, therefore, made a robot with suckers on its hands and feet. The robot could hang on the wall but fell off when crawling. So, they went on researching. 6 years ago, scientists discovered that suckers only were not enough. It is the bristles   on each foot that adds friction   and static adsorption   that makes a lizard move on the smooth wall easily without falling down.  Then scientists made great efforts to fix thick bristles to the robot's hands and feet. However, the effect was not satisfactory. The robot still couldn't attach itself firmly to the wall.

With any luck he isn't even hurt. Why? Because the men who fall out of high windows or jump from fast moving trains, who crash cars or even catch fire, are professionals. They do this for a living. These men are called stuntmen. That is to say, they perform tricks. They actually do most of the things you see on the screen. For example, they fall from a high building.

Again, when they hit one another with chairs, the chairs are made of soft wood and when they crash through windows, the glass is made of sugar! But although their work depends on tricks of this sort, it also requires a high degree of skill and training. Often a stuntman's success depends on careful timing. For example, when he is \" blown up\" in a battle scene, he has to jump out of the way of the explosion just at the right moment.

As we were sitting on the sidelines enjoying the game, a low-flying bird came swooping in attempting to land on my daughter's head! It honestly came out of nowhere. We were seated by ourselves on the tree lined side of the field. I was able to calm my daughter's shock and fear once I showed her that the bird was not some wild animal, it was in fact, somebody's pet! Now, we're sitting at the outdoor fields of the Pontiac Silverdome, far from any populated area, wondering where this very social cockatiel, an Australian parrot   could have come from. I walked up to the bird and put out my hand. Immediately, it hopped on and chirped in a friendly way. We looked around us and knew that we could not just leave and suppose that the bird would return to where it came from. This was a very bird that needed help or it would not survive. The flag football game had ended so we walked the bird over to other groups of adults and asked if they knew of anyone who had lost a bird. All the kids were excited about the bird and fed it with some post game snacks. The bird's nails were getting long and he was looking pretty dirty, so we knew it had been out here for a long time and was hungry. Since its wings were clipped, it could fly a little but probably not more than 100 yards or so at a try. We all just scratched our heads as a group wondering what to do with the lost bird. We explained to the kids that this bird needed our help since it was someone's pet and would not know how to get its own food, and it could not fly well since its wings were clipped. The kids understood, and all of them wanted to take the bird home! The parents however, knew this was not a good choice as one had a large dog, another two cats, etc. We explained to the kids that one of us could take the bird home for the night and then bring it to the Humane Society in the morning in hopes to connect it to its owners. We couldn't keep the bird. It wasn't ours. This was tough for the kids to understand at first. We couldn't just leave the bird either. There was no way it could attend itself. The group of us sat around the Silverdome practice fields for quite a while trying to determine the best course of choice for the lost bird. It was getting dark out but no one was willing to leave that parking lot until we had a game plan for how to help the bird. The owner of the football league, Chris Novak, offered to take the bird. It was extremely nice of him and he really stepped in to help while all the rest of us who had kids tugging on our shirts and begging to take it home. We took a box and put a bunch of holes in it and he brought it home for the night. Another mom went online and found a family that had lost a bird that looked just like the one we'd found. She emailed the info to Chris who got in touch with the family and the next day, reunited the bird with the family that lost it almost 3 weeks earlier! When Chris emailed us to let us know, we could not believe that this bird had traveled from The Rochester Tienken area all the way to the Silverdome! We were so happy to be able to save this bird and get it back to its family. I showed my kids the email about how the other family got their pet back. The family has 3 kids who were so happy to see their bird. My kids realized what a nice ending this story had. Not only had we been able to save this bird's life, but we were able to bring it back to the family that loves and misses him. The life lesson in the missing bird story seemed to miss its mark with my kids at first. They were a little bummed out that they couldn't keep the lost bird. I explained to them that when an animal or someone needs help, you just can't turn a blind eye and hope everything works out OK. The \"lost bird incident\" was also a reminder to them that teamwork and the kindness of strangers can make a world of difference and that a group of well-meaning strangers can work together to help someone. It wasn't a heroic act, but one that I knew had sunk in with my kids when they realized that trying to help was the best and only real course of action.

When Chris emailed us to let us know, we could not believe that this bird had traveled from The Rochester Tienken area all the way to the Silverdome! We were so happy to be able to save this bird and get it back to its family. I showed my kids the email about how the other family got their pet back. The family has 3 kids who were so happy to see their bird. My kids realized what a nice ending this story had. Not only had we been able to save this bird's life, but we were able to bring it back to the family that loves and misses him. The life lesson in the missing bird story seemed to miss its mark with my kids at first. They were a little bummed out that they couldn't keep the lost bird. I explained to them that when an animal or someone needs help, you just can't turn a blind eye and hope everything works out OK. The \"lost bird incident\" was also a reminder to them that teamwork and the kindness of strangers can make a world of difference and that a group of well-meaning strangers can work together to help someone. It wasn't a heroic act, but one that I knew had sunk in with my kids when they realized that trying to help was the best and only real course of action.

We were seated by ourselves on the tree lined side of the field. I was able to calm my daughter's shock and fear once I showed her that the bird was not some wild animal, it was in fact, somebody's pet! Now, we're sitting at the outdoor fields of the Pontiac Silverdome, far from any populated area, wondering where this very social cockatiel, an Australian parrot   could have come from. I walked up to the bird and put out my hand. Immediately, it hopped on and chirped in a friendly way. We looked around us and knew that we could not just leave and suppose that the bird would return to where it came from. This was a very bird that needed help or it would not survive. The flag football game had ended so we walked the bird over to other groups of adults and asked if they knew of anyone who had lost a bird. All the kids were excited about the bird and fed it with some post game snacks. The bird's nails were getting long and he was looking pretty dirty, so we knew it had been out here for a long time and was hungry. Since its wings were clipped, it could fly a little but probably not more than 100 yards or so at a try. We all just scratched our heads as a group wondering what to do with the lost bird. We explained to the kids that this bird needed our help since it was someone's pet and would not know how to get its own food, and it could not fly well since its wings were clipped. The kids understood, and all of them wanted to take the bird home! The parents however, knew this was not a good choice as one had a large dog, another two cats, etc. We explained to the kids that one of us could take the bird home for the night and then bring it to the Humane Society in the morning in hopes to connect it to its owners. We couldn't keep the bird. It wasn't ours. This was tough for the kids to understand at first. We couldn't just leave the bird either. There was no way it could attend itself. The group of us sat around the Silverdome practice fields for quite a while trying to determine the best course of choice for the lost bird. It was getting dark out but no one was willing to leave that parking lot until we had a game plan for how to help the bird. The owner of the football league, Chris Novak, offered to take the bird.

While he was on his way to Room 414, he started to think, \"How can I divide $5? Well, I'll give each of them only $1 and I keep $2. The men will be happy to get anything back. I'll make a little money and Mr Smith will never know.\" So he returned $1 to each man. You see, there come a problem, each man had at first paid $10. After the worker returned them $1 each, each man had paid 9. There were three men, $9 x 3 =\" $27.\" The worker kept $2 --$27+$2=\"29.\" Where is the missing dollar?

Rafting in N.C. has the added benefit of a long, warm rafting season, beautiful scenery, and amazing history. Only twenty minutes from Asheville, N.C., whitewater rafting on French Broad River in N.C. still has the flavor wilderness and adventure. Half Day Trip: This N.C. whitewater rafting trip begins at Barnard and finishes at Stackhouse. Typical time on the river is 1.5 to 2 hours. A couple of factors that affect the time on the river are the size of the trip and the level of the river. A small trip at high water will move faster downstream than a larger trip at lower levels. $44.00 per person. Half Day with Lunch: This rafting trip travels the same section of the French Broad River as above. The lunch is served riverside. The time frame for this trip is the same as the half day trip. Add about an hour for lunch and a more leisurely pace. $51.00 per person. Full Day Trip: This rafting starts at Barnard and finishes 8 miles downstream in Hot Springs. This is one of the best whitewater rafting trips in N.C. and gives you a chance to spend a big part of your day on the French Broad River. There is a stop for lunch, served riverside. Time on the river for the full day trip can range from 3-5 hours depending on the size of the trip and the river level. Please be aware that summer-time river levels may make it necessary to alter this trip and make it a half-day with lunch trip. Surely you will be refunded the price difference. $62.00 per person. Float Trip: Rafting in N.C. does not necessarily mean only whitewater rafting. Some of North Carolina's best rafting is just the classic, lazy float trip. This trip floats through a beautiful section of the French Broad River valley. There are plenty of places to swim. It's good for those who are too young or too old. $44.00 per person. Trip Times: Typical morning trip time is 9:00 and afternoon 2:00. There's usually an hour of getting ready and transportation before putting on the river, and an hour of transportation, changing clothes, photo show, etc after taking off the river. If a family of 3 reserves a full day trip and they have to change it to a half-day with lunch trip, how much will they get back?", "subject": ""}

The world football organization, FIFA, has shown interest in the technology. It is very possible that the new technology will be used in the 2018 World Cup in Russia. \"We've been testing the technology at the main soccer stadium in Nuremberg for some time and more recently in an under-17 FIFA Cup in Peru,\" said Gunter Rohmer, a director of the company. \"The technology has performed well, and we're pretty optimistic that it will be used at the games in Russia.\" The chip only weighs 12 grams, and is placed in the center of the football. It sends 2,000 signals a second to a receiver network of 12 antennas ,placed around the field. The receivers then send information about the ball's location to a central computer, and because it works in real time, it can immediately tell the referee whether a goal has been scored. The chip even can tell when the ball crosses the line in mid-air. Oliver Braun, one of the inventors of the chip, says that feedback from German referees was generally positive. Germany sports-wear giant Adidas is also optimistic about using this kind of chip in other ball sports.

It sends 2,000 signals a second to a receiver network of 12 antennas ,placed around the field. The receivers then send information about the ball's location to a central computer, and because it works in real time, it can immediately tell the referee whether a goal has been scored. The chip even can tell when the ball crosses the line in mid-air. Oliver Braun, one of the inventors of the chip, says that feedback from German referees was generally positive. Germany sports-wear giant Adidas is also optimistic about using this kind of chip in other ball sports. FIFA aims to test the technology later this year at another game in Japan before deciding whether or not to introduce it in all 12 stadiums in Russia for next World Cup.

Millions upon millions of people have read it in over 25 different languages, but fewer know about the author and the history of the composition of the creative masterwork. John Ronald Refuel Tolkien was born in South Africa in 1892. His parents died when he was a child. Living in England with his aunt, Tolkien and his cousins made up play languages, a hobby that led to Tolkien's becoming skilled in Welsh, Greek, Gothic, Old Norse and Anglo--Saxon. After graduating from Oxford, Tolkien served in World War I. In 1917, while recovering from trench fever he began composing the mythology for The Rings. As a professor of Anglo-Saxon in the 1930s at Oxford, Tolkien was part of an informal discussion group called the Inklings, which included several writers. The group was soon 1istening to chapters of Tolkien's imaginative work \"The Hobbit\". Hobbit was a name Tolkien created for people that could best be described as half-sized members of the English rural class. Hobbits live in hillside holes. One of them,Bilbo Baggins, looks for treasures with a group of dwarves . On the way, he meets the twisted, pitiful creature Gollum, from whom he sees a golden ring that makes the holder invisible. One of Tolkien's students persuaded her employer, publisher Allen & Unwind, to look at a draft  . The chairman of the firm, Stanley Unwind, thought that the best judge for a Children's book would be his ten-year-old son. The boy earned a shilling for reporting back that the adventure was exciting, and \"The Hobbit\" was published in 1937. It sold so well that Unwind asked for a continuation.

{"answer": 1, "choices": ["One of Tolkien's students.", "Stanley Unwind's son.", "Allen & Unwind.", "Bilbo Baggins."], "question": "\"The Lord of the Rings\", one of the best sellers in the new millennium , was made up of three parts--\"The Fellow Ship of the Ring\", \"Two Towers\", and \"The Return of the King\". Millions upon millions of people have read it in over 25 different languages, but fewer know about the author and the history of the composition of the creative masterwork. John Ronald Refuel Tolkien was born in South Africa in 1892. His parents died when he was a child. Living in England with his aunt, Tolkien and his cousins made up play languages, a hobby that led to Tolkien's becoming skilled in Welsh, Greek, Gothic, Old Norse and Anglo--Saxon. After graduating from Oxford, Tolkien served in World War I. In 1917, while recovering from trench fever he began composing the mythology for The Rings. As a professor of Anglo-Saxon in the 1930s at Oxford, Tolkien was part of an informal discussion group called the Inklings, which included several writers. The group was soon 1istening to chapters of Tolkien's imaginative work \"The Hobbit\". Hobbit was a name Tolkien created for people that could best be described as half-sized members of the English rural class. Hobbits live in hillside holes. One of them,Bilbo Baggins, looks for treasures with a group of dwarves . On the way, he meets the twisted, pitiful creature Gollum, from whom he sees a golden ring that makes the holder invisible. One of Tolkien's students persuaded her employer, publisher Allen & Unwind, to look at a draft  . The chairman of the firm, Stanley Unwind, thought that the best judge for a Children's book would be his ten-year-old son. The boy earned a shilling for reporting back that the adventure was exciting, and \"The Hobbit\" was published in 1937. It sold so well that Unwind asked for a continuation. Over a dozen years later, in 1954, Tolkien produced \"The Lord of the Rings\", a series of books so creative that they hold readers both new and old -- after their publication. Which of the following helped most in making \"The Hobbit\" published?", "subject": ""}

Unlike other painters seeking fast recognition of their talent, he doesn't really care about \"being this big artist\".Instead he is more concerned about bringing attention to how much smog there really is in his home town and how it's destroying both its monuments and people.

A study of more than 1,000 Scottish 70-year-olds found that those who had had complex jobs scored better on memory and thinking tests.

A study of more than 1,000 Scottish 70-year-olds found that those who had had complex jobs scored better on memory and thinking tests. One theory is that a more stimulating environment helps build up a \"cognitive reserve\" to help buffer the brain against age-related decline. The research was reported in Neurology. The team, from Heriot-Watt University, in Edinburgh, is now planning more work to look at how lifestyle and work interact to affect memory loss. Those taking part in the study took tests designed to assess memory, processing speed and general thinking ability, as well as filling in a questionnaire about their working life. The analysis showed that those whose jobs had required complex skills in dealing with data or people, such as management and teaching, had better scores on memory and thinking tests than those who had done less mentally intense jobs such as factory workers, bookbinders, or carpet layers. While the study did not look at biological reasons for the protective effect of certain jobs, potential explanations include that structural changes within the brain mean less damage is accumulated over time. Study leader Dr Alan Gow said: \"Our findings have helped to identify the kinds of job demands that preserve memory and thinking later on.\" \"However,\" He added, \"while it is true that people who have higher cognitive abilities are more likely to get more complex jobs, there still seems to be a small advantage gained from these complex jobs for later thinking skills.\" Dr Simon Ridley, head of research at Alzheimer's Research UK, said the study added to the growing evidence about factors that affected brain health as we aged. \"Keeping the brain active throughout life could be helpful and different types of work may play a role. However, it's important to note that this study points to a small and subtle association between occupation and later-life cognition rather than offering proof that people's occupation has a direct influence.\" What is the best title of the passage?", "subject": ""}

In an attempt to evade policemen after a bank robbery, the Associated Press reports that 20-year-old Larry Whitfield broke into the home of Mary Parnell. Police say he didn't touch Parnell but that she died after suffering a heart attack that was caused by terror. Can the guy be held responsible for the woman's death? Prosecutors  said that he can under the state's murder rule, which allows someone to be charged with murder if he or she causes another person's death while committing or fleeing from a severe crime like robbery--even if he or she doesn't kill someone on purpose. But, medically speaking, can someone actually be frightened to death? We asked Martin Samuels, chairman of the neurology department at Brigham and Women's Hospital in Boston. Absolutely, no question about it. The body has a natural protective method called the fight-or-flight response , which was originally described by Walter Cannon,the chairman of Harvard University's physiology department from 1906 to 1942. If, in the wild, an animal is faced with a life-threatening situation, the autonomic nervous system responds by increasing heart rate, increasing blood flow to the muscles, and slowing digestion, among other things. All of this increases the chances of succeeding in a fight or running away from an aggressive beast. This process certainly would be of help to primitive humans. However, in the modern world there is obvious decline of the fight-or-flight response. The autonomic nervous system uses the chemical messenger to send signals to various parts of the body to activate the fight-or-flight response. This chemical is toxic in large amounts; it damages the organs such as the heart, lungs, liver and kidneys. It is believed that almost all sudden deaths are caused by damage to the heart. There is almost no other organ that would fail so fast as to cause sudden death. Kidney failure, liver failure, those things don't kill you suddenly. By the way, any strong positive or negative emotions such as happiness or sadness can cause the same result. There are people who have died in intercourse or in religious passion. There was a case of a golfer who hit a hole in one, turned to his partner and said, \"I can die now\", and then he dropped dead.

However, he had lately come to rely on the growing number of hill-walkers in the region as sources of international news. In the spring of 1992, a Spanish student came across Angus high in the mountains. Eager to practise his English he engaged Angus in conversation. The student told Angus of the forthcoming Olympic Games in Barcelona. Excited by the student's colourful description of Spain and the Games, Angus decided to attend the event in person and two months later arrived in Barcelona. The ticketless Angus stood outside the stadium with his canny brain working overtime, watching a growing number of individuals entering the stadium through a small entrance at the side. He noticed that they all seemed to be carrying objects. Perhaps they were workmen, he thought. He moved closer and watched. Within minutes a thin young man came along carrying an extremely long pole. He approached the official at the door and said \"Pole Vault\". The official moved to the side and the man entered. Next came a heavy-set man with a spear. Angus wondered how a man could carry such a dangerous weapon in a modern city. The man shouted \" Javelin \" and was presently admitted. Angus was puzzled. Perhaps they were all connected with security. His puzzlement grew when a huge man appeared with a steel ball in his hand. He shouted \"Shot Putt\" and walked past the official. It suddenly dawned on Angus that these people were competitors. He opened his programme and sure enough under the heading \"events\" he saw the three words the men had said. Angus laughed to himself as a plan began to take shape in his mind. First he needed to buy one or two things. An hour later he reappeared dressed in a tracksuit with \"Scotland\" written across the chest. Over his shoulder he carried a roll of barbed wire  . Smiling to himself he walked up to the official and as casually as he could, shouted, \"Fencing!\" Which was Angus' new way of getting information about the outside world?", "subject": ""}

{"answer": 0, "choices": ["Fishing ships began using new tools with which they could catch more fish.", "There were fewer smaller fish than before.", "There were more people catching big predators.", "Their environment was being polluted by fishing ships."], "question": "You may have heard the popular saying, \"there are always more fish in the sea\". But as many new studies show, fish populations are changing, and not necessarily for the better. Consider the case of big, predatory   fish. These giants, like sharks and cod  , eat other smaller fish. Big fish are an important part of the marine ecosystem   because they keep down the numbers of smaller fish. Without fish that eat other fish, populations of smaller swimmers would increase, eating more plants, and leaving less vegetation for other creatures, including future fish. As fierce as predators can be, they're no match for fishing technology. Many people love to catch predatory fish like sharks, cod and tuna, and new studies suggest that over-fishing is threatening these creatures near the top of the marine food chain. In one study, Villy Christensen and his colleagues looked at 200 past studies of marine life to learn how fish populations have changed over time. Christensen reported that between 1910 and 1970, the numbers of big predators decreased slowly, and that in 1970 their populations really started to drop. Around that time, fishing ships began using new tools that led to more fish being caught. The numbers have been falling quickly ever since. Reg Watson looked at the problem from the perspective of the fishermen. In the middle of the 20thcentury, Watson reported, fishing boats didn't go far from home, and most fish were caught near the shore. That was no longer true by the 1980s. By then, fishing had moved farther from shore, into the open oceans, and was helped by the development of new technologies. But since the 1990s, something has changed. Despite new technologies and more efforts, fishing operations have not continued to develop. Scientists study historical data to understand the present, and this research is needed to forecast the future of fish and fishing. And the forecast doesn't look good: large predator fish are becoming harder to find, and soon may disappear. Why did the number of big predators begin to fall quickly in 1970?", "subject": ""}

President John Kennedy established the Peace Corps soon after he took office in 1961. It was the time of the Cold War between the United States and the Soviet Union. The new program gave Americans a chance to answer the call to service that the president made in his inaugural speech. \"Ask not what your country can do for you,\" he said. \"Ask what you can do for your country.\" Kennedy told Peace Corps volunteers that America's image in the countries where they were going would depend largely on them. On August 30th, 1961, the first group of 51 Peace Corps volunteers arrived in Accra, Ghana, to serve as teachers. They had agreed to work for almost no pay. They would spend two years in Ghana helping its people and learning the reality of life in a developing country. Most of the volunteers had just completed college. About half of them taught English or health care. In the 50 years since then, more than 200,000 Americans have served as Peace Corps volunteers. They have worked in 139 countries.

His father was an African and his mother was a white American. He grew up in Indonesia and Hawaii. When Obama was 10 years old, he was one of the only three black students at his school in Hawaii. He felt very different from most other students. White girls wanted to touch his hair. A white boy even asked him what his father was. \"I lied to them that my father was a Kenyan prince.

While it may be common for university researchers to try their luck in the commercial world, there is very little traffic in the opposite direction. Pay has always been the biggest deterrent, as people with families often feel they cannot afford the drop in salary when moving to a university job. For some industrial scientists, however, the attractions of academia   outweigh any financial considerations. Helen Lee took a 70% cut in salary when she moved from a senior post in Abbott Laboratories to a medical department at the University of Cambridge. Her main reason for returning to academia mid-career was to take advantage of the greater freedom to choose research questions. Some areas of inquiry have few prospects of a commercial return, and Lee's is one of them. The impact of a salary cut is probably less severe for a scientist in the early stages of a career. Guy Grant, now a research associate at the Unilever Centre for Molecular Informatics at the University of Cambridge, spent two years working for a pharmaceutical   company before returning to university as a post-doctoral researcher. He took a 30% salary cut but felt it worthwhile for the greater intellectual opportunities. Higher up the ladder, where a pay cut is usually more significant, the demand for scientists with a wealth of experience in industry is forcing universities to make the transition to academia more attractive, according to Lee. Industrial scientists tend to receive training that academics do not, such as how to build a multidisciplinary team, manage budgets and negotiate contracts. They are also well placed to bring something extra to the teaching side of an academic role that will help students get a job when they graduate, says Lee, perhaps experience in manufacturing practice or product development. \"Only a small number of undergraduates will continue in an academic career.

But digging deeper,the researchers found that personality--specifically being introverted   or extroverted  --could either intensify or buffer   the effect of moving to a new town or neighborhood during childhood.The negative impact of more moves during childhood was far greater for introverts compared to extroverts. \"Moving a lot makes it difficult for people to maintain longterm close relationships,\" stated Dr.Shigehiro Oishi,the first author of the study,in a press release from the American Psychological Association,\"This might not be a serious problem for outgoing people who can make friends quickly and easily.Less outgoing people have a harder time making new friends.\" Families often have to relocate--across town,across the country,or across the globe.Yet,in many cases,their kids and young adolescents haven't yet built up a bank of friendships.So the conventional wisdom is to try to minimize moves for the sake of your child,whenever possible,and to move at the end of the academic year.

Psychologists have known that one person's perception  of another's \"warmth\"  powerfully determines social relationships.Judging someone to be either \"warm\" or \"cold\" is a primary consideration, even trumping  evidence that a \"cold\" person may be more capable.Much of this is rooted in early childhood experiences, Bargh argues, when babies' conceptual  sense of the world around them is shaped by physical sensations, particularly warmth and coldness.Classic studies by Harry Harlow, published in 1958, showed monkeys preferred to stay close to a cloth \"mother\" rather than one made of wire, even when the wire \"mother\" carried a food bottle.Harlow's work and later studies have led psychologists to stress the need for warm physical contact from caregivers to help young children grow into healthy adults with normal social skills.     Feelings of \"warmth\" and \"coldness\" in social judgments appear to be universal.Although no worldwide study has been done, Bargh says that describing people as \"warm\" or \"cold\" is common to many cultures, and studies have found those perceptions influence judgment in dozens of countries.

Kelly Brownell, director of the Rudd Center for Food Policy and Obesity at Yale University, said he believes the ban would be effective. \"It is not right to put all the blame for obesity on sugar drinks, but they are strongly connected with this rise in obesity over the last 30 years.\" Dr. Farley, the health commissioner, said the city had seen higher obesity rates in neighborhoods where soda consumption was more common. City officials said they believe it will finally prove popular and push governments around the U.S. to follow similar rules. Mr. Bloomberg has introduced a series of rules in his term of office, including bans on smoking in restaurants and parks, a ban on trans fat  in restaurant food and a requirement for health inspection grades to be posted in restaurant windows. Because of the measures, the mayor was laughed at as Nanny Bloomberg, by those who view the bans as threats  to personal freedom. But many of the measures adopted in New York have become models for other cities, including bans on smoking and trans fat, as well as the use of graphic advertising to fight smoking and soda consumption, and the demand that restaurants post calories contents next to prices.

For instance, he was writing with his left hand from left to right and he was also a vegetarian, which was not common. Mona Lisa is probably a portrait of his mother, as Sigmund Freud said in 1910. On the back of Mona Lisa, there is a Chinese landscape and even her face looks Chinese. Mr. Paratico said he believes the only way to solve the mystery is to dig out some of Da Vinci's relations in Florence and extract some DNA.

Mr. Paratico said the documents he has uncovered during two years of research form the basis of his latest book Leonardo Da Vinci, a Chinese scholar lost in Renaissance   Italy. The book, which is due to be published next year, uncovers evidence that there's a link between Da Vinci and the Far Fast. Speaking to the South China Morning http://w|ww?.wln%100.com @Post, Mr. Paratico said, \"I am sure that Leonardo's mother was from the East, but to make her a Chinese, we need to use a deductive method  . One wealthy client of Leonardo's father had a slave called Caterina. After Leonardo's date of birth, she disappeared from the documents. She was no longer working there.\" It is believed that his mother was called Caterina, who, according to some reports, was a local peasant.

One of these is undue absorption in the past. It does not do to live in memories, in regrets for the good old days, or in sadness about friends who are dead. One's thoughts must be directed to the future and to things about which there is something to be done. It is unwise to be too attached to the youth in the hope of sucking vigor from its vitality. When your children are grown up they want to live their own lives, and if you continue to be as interested in them as you were when they were young, you are likely to become a burden to them, unless they are cold to you. I think that a successful old age is easiest for those who have strong impersonal interests involving appropriate activities. It is in this sphere that long experience is really fruitful, and it is in this sphere that the wisdom born of experience can be exercised without being oppressive. It is no use telling grown-up children not to make mistakes, both because they will not believe you, and because mistakes are an essential part of education. But if you are one of those who are incapable of impersonal interests, you may find that your life will be empty unless you concern yourself with you children and grandchildren. In that case you must realize that while you can still _ them material services, such as making them an allowance or knitting them jumpers, you must not expect that they will enjoy your company.

Some plants have relative immunity to a great many diseases, while others have a susceptibility to them.A blight   may be but a local infection easily controlled; on the other hand it can attack particular plants in a whole region or nation.An example is the blight which killed virtually every chestnut tree in North America.Another is the famous potato blight in Ireland in the last century.As a result of that, it was estimated that one million people died of starvation and related ailments. Plant pathologists have made remarkable strides in identifying the pathogens of the various diseases.Bacteria may invade a plant through an infestation of insect parasites carrying the pathogen.A plant can also be inoculated by man.Other diseases might be caused by fungus which attacks the plant in the form of a model or smut or rust.Frequently such a primary infection will weaken the plant so that a secondary infection may result form its lack of tolerance.The symptoms  shown may cause an error in diagnosis, so that treatment may be directed toward bacteria  which could be the result of a susceptibility caused by a primary virus infection.

{"answer": 2, "choices": ["Juliet", "Hamlet", "Claire Danes", "Romeo"], "question": "William Shakespeare is the most famous playwright  . Although he died in 1616, people still go to see his plays. Among the most popular are Romeo and Juliet, A Midsummer Night's Dream and Hamlet -- the story of a prince who struggles to respond to the crimes around him. Shakespeare, who was born in 1564, was an actor as well as a writer. Most of his ideas for plays were taken from history, people's conversation, ancient stories, and also from other writers. He wrote not only about kings and queens and princes, but also about friends and ordinary people. He wrote about the cruelty of war and the bravery of heroes, as well as about jealousy, joy, hate, ambition and love. His stories live on. The tragedy Romeo and Juliet was reborn as the musical West Side Story and more recently as the movie Romeo and Juliet with the wonderful performance of Leonardo DiCaprio and Claire Danes. He invented a number of great characters: powerful magicians, thrilling witches, smart women and both wise and wicked men. He also invented some great phrases. If you've ever said, \"Oh, for goodness sake!\" you can thank Shakespeare for that. \"To be, or not to be: that is the question,\" Hamlet says. \"Good night, good night.

Then beginning in the 400s AD, tribes from the north, known as the Engles, the Saxons, and the Jutes, moved in. The most famous leader of this time period in England was Alfred the Great. Alfred lived in Wessex, the kingdom of the West Saxons, which was in the southern part of England. He was a good leader who made his kingdom stronger. He created a system of defenses , called burhs, across the country. He reorganized the army so that his men had time to fight and time to farm. Alfred's efforts protected his people from the Vikings and allowed Wessex to grow. Eventually the rulers of Wessex would rule all of England. Alfred also made other improvements. He made laws for his people. He encouraged learning and translated several important books into his Saxon language. This was the beginning of the language we call English today.

Or do you prefer the phrase from the 1930's song that \"life is just a bowl of cherries \"? Though simply stated, each conveys a very different view. A \"box\" implies mystery, because we don't know what is in a closed box. Meanwhile, a \"bowl\" of cherries is completely in view. For many centuries, the metaphor of life that probably burst into most people's mind was the one suggested by Shakespeare: \"All of life is a stage...\" On that stage, we take seven roles. More recently, psychologist Erik Erikson took up the idea of life as a stage. Erikson regarded development as a \"powerful unfolding\" in which we are driven from one stage to the next as our bodies, minds, and social roles develop. Stage metaphors fit with many of our common-sense ideas about change, but the problem with the stage metaphor is that it isn't particularly accurate. None of the studies that try to clarify the universality of adult life stages actually studied people as they developed over time. All of them were based on performances of their samples  at one point in time. People's actual lives don't fit into these stage metaphors. They don't automatically transform when people reach a certain age. Instead, people's real lives are messy, unpredictable, and full of surprises. Today, I'd like to focus on an even longer study, an 80-year study which is the subject of a recent book by Howard Friedman and Leslie Martin. Their final chapter summarizes the \"many changes of healthy and unhealthy pathways\" that their participants took over the course of their lives. As I too discovered in my research, the pathway provides a perfect metaphor of human development. We don't all go down the same road marked with the same signposts based on age. People travel through diverse routes as they track the years of adulthood. Friedman and Martin use health and long life as their measure; I've used sense of achievement. In both cases, we are in perfect agreement in evaluating development not according to age but \"the key features of life\". The paths that Friedman and Martin describe seize the changes that characterize people as they age. Some examples are \"The High Road\" (reliable, full of plans); \"Not Easy Street\" (exposed to high stress throughout life), \"Catastrophe Lane\" (a downwardly twisty life); \"Happy Trails to You\" (cheerful, sociable), \"The Road to Resilience\" (able to handle stress with a strong will). Though I haven't yet been able to follow my participants for 80 years, I too saw some of these pathways among my samples: \"The Minding Way\" , \"The Downward Slope\" , \"The Straight and Narrow Path\" , and \"The Successful Trail\".

These awful sudden risings of the sea are caused by earthquakes or underwater volcanic action. The story of the boy Yuuki is the story of such a disaster.

It was not strong enough to frighten anybody and passed quickly. Soon after, however, Yuuki noticed the sea darken and begin running away from the shore very fast, leaving behind wide stretches of beach that had never been exposed before.     With a gasp, Yuuki remembered reading that just before a terrible tsunami, the sea suddenly and quickly rolls backward. He ran to the beach, warning the villagers who had gathered to admire the huge new stretch of beach.     \"Get back!\" shouted the boy. \"There is terrible danger!\" But no one listened. They laughed at him and continued playing in the new sand and watching the sea roll backward even more.     Desperate, Yuuki could think of only one thing to do. He lit a tree branch, raced to the rice fields and began burning the stacks of harvested rice. Then he called out, \"Fire! Fire! Everyone run to the mountain! Now!\"     When everyone reached the mountain-top, a villager cried out, \"Yuuki is mad! I saw him set the fire.\" Yuuki hung his head in shame, but said nothing as the villagers cursed him.     Just then, someone cried, \"Look!\"     In the distance what seemed to be a huge dark line was speeding towards the shore. As it got nearer the people realized the long thin line of darkness was the returning sea, towering like a mountain.

A vegetarian  diet is often praised for its health benefits. Studies have shown that vegetarians usually have lower levels of heart disease and a lower risk of diabetes than people who eat meat. What most people are less aware of, however, are the effects that a vegetarian diet can have on the environment.     Researchers from the Union of Concerned Scientists in the US recently studied how consumer behavior affects the environment. The study showed that meat consumption is one of the main ways that humans can damage the environment, second only to the use of motor vehicle.     Then, how can eating meat have a negative effect on the environment? For a start, all farm animals such as cows, pigs, and sheep give off methane gas by expelling  wind from their bodies. One cow can produce up to 60 liters of methane  each day. Methane gas is the second most common greenhouse gas after carbon dioxide. Many environmental experts now believe that it is more responsible for global warming than carbon dioxide. It is estimated that 25% of all methane released into the atmosphere comes from farm animals.     Another way that meat production affects the environment is through the use of water and land. 2,500 gallons of water are needed to produce one pound of beef, whereas 20 gallons of water are needed to produce one pound of wheat. One acre of farmland used for crop production can produce 40,000 pounds of potatoes, 30,000 pounds of carrots, or 50,000 pounds of tomatoes.     Many people now see the benefits of switching to a vegetarian diet, not just for health reasons, but also because it plays a vital role in protecting the environment.

The Mandometer monitors the amount of food leaving the plate, and tells users, \"Please eat more slowly.\" The PS1,500 Swedish device is to be used in a National Health Service plan to help hundreds of obese families lose weight. It comes in two parts -- a scale placed under the plate and a small computer screen showing a graphic  of the food gradually disappearing as the user eats.

After a recent trial using the device, experts believe teaching obese people to eat more slowly will help them know when they are full. Around 600 families with at least one obese parent and child (aged five or older) were targeted in the project by Bristol University, along with GPs and nurses. Professor Julian Hamilton-Shield, who is leading the plan, says obese children and adolescents using the Mandometer ate from 12 to 15 percent less per meal at the end of the 12-month trial.

We know that an awful lot of teachers who are teaching science today have not been properly empowered to do so. School frequently isn't testing whether you understand something but whether you're familiar with it. What's Newton's second law? You say F=ma, and you get an A.

Everyone recognizes the names Yahoo and Microsoft, but everyone also says, \"Did you Google it?\" Such a catchphrase   is going to be hard to beat. Shaun Carney of Laurelville, Ohio I think the merger   will provide more competitions for Google. I don't think the merger will allow Microsoft to develop faster than Google, though. I believe the increased competition this merger brings will force Google to stay on top of its game by offering more fresh and original Internet tools and expanding on the tools it already offers. Toni Suarez of Hacienda Heights, California I view the merger as a necessary element in preventing a monopolization  . Perhaps it would bring better high technology innovations to e-mail and help in researching and developing a better Internet! Rick R. of Edgewater, Florida It sounds like a disaster to me. If this were to happen, I would stop using my Yahoo e-mail account because I don't like the feeling of Microsoft spying upon my business. I will sign up for Google.

Besides, you're not supposed to give money to beggars. Somewhere over Seattle, I started to write my weekly garden column for The Anchorage Daily News. _ , I came up with an idea.

{"answer": 2, "choices": ["of different age groups", "with different habits", "in different environments", "from different areas"], "question": "The high noise of modern life may affect speech and language development in the very young, according to a study that found the auditory   parts of the brains of young mice are slower to organize properly in the presence of continuous sounds. Researchers at the University of California, San Francisco, reared a group of rats in an environment of continuous background noise and found that their brain circuits that receive and interpret   sound did not develop at the same rate as animals that were raised in a quieter environment. Edward F. Chang and Michael Merzenich, co-authors of the study appearing in the journal Science, said that the continuous noise delayed the organization of auditory neurons   during a critical two-to-three-week period after the rat pups were born. For rats not exposed to the noise, the auditory cortex  neurons during this period gathered into a smaller area and began developing a selective response to sounds. But for the noiseexposed rats, this organization was slowed, causing a delay in the development of the ability to discriminate  specific sound tones. The researchers said it took three or four times longer for the rats raised in a noisy environment to reach the basic bench marks   of auditory development seen in the rat pups not exposed to noises. Although the rat is not a perfect model for what happens in humans, the authors note, the study does suggest that high levels of noise might possibly affect some language learning in babies. \"These findings suggest that environmental noise, which is commonly present in contemporary child-rearing environments, can potentially contribute to auditory and language-related development delays,\"the authors wrote in Science.

Firth began appearing on English TV in the early 1990s,but it wasn't until he played Mr Darcy,a charming upper class character from Jane Austen's famous novel\"Pride and Prejudice\",that Firth's career really took off.His portrayal of the perfect fictional gentleman conquered millions of hearts,especially females'. In many fans and critics'eyes,Firth has British good looks,British charm,and a gift for characters with a British sense of being reserved .Movie reviewer Jason O'Bryan described Firth as\"always befitting the calm and stiff-upper-lip British gentlemen character\". However Firth doesn't consider himself the authority on gentlemen.\"I don't necessarily approach every challenge like a perfect English gentleman spy.There are many aspects in my personality that are not consistent with someone like Harry Hart,\"he said to Dialogue,an English--language show on CCTV News. But let's just take his words as another gentlemanly quality-modesty.After all,who might expect an Oscar-winning actor over 50 years old to learn to fight for his first action movie? To prepare for Kingsman,Firth trained for three hours every day over six months.He broke a tooth and got bruised everywhere,but took the damage as a symbol of his accomplishments.

One day when I suggested that he might start on his homework before dinner, John, who always put things off, said: \"You're right. I guess I will.\" When I mentioned this incident to one of his teachers, she joked that the coat must have changed him.

Not very much, according to many educators. However, scientists say it is far too soon to declare handwriting is not important. New evidence suggests that the link between handwriting and educational development is deep. Children not only learn to read more quickly when they first learn to write by hand, but they are also better able to create ideas and remember information. In other words, it's not only what we write that matters -- but how. A study led by Karin James, a psychologist at Indiana University, gave support to _ . A group of children, who had not learned to read and write, were offered a letter or a shape on a card and asked to copy it in one of three ways: draw the image on a page but with a dotted outline , draw it on a piece of blank white paper, or type it on a computer. Then the researchers put the children in a brain scanner and showed them the image again. It was found that when children had drawn a letter freehand without a dotted outline or a computer, the activity in three areas of the brain were increased. These three areas work actively in adults when they read and write. By contrast, children who chose the other two ways showed no such effect. Dr. James attributes the differences to the process of free handwriting: Not only must we first plan and take action in a way but we are also likely to produce a result that is variable. Those are not necessary when we have an outline. It's time for educators to change their mind and pay more attention to children's handwriting.

Although Keats didn't receive much formal literary education, his own studies and passion brought him much success. Additionally, his own life situation influenced his poetry greatly. Growing up as a young boy in London in a lower middle-class family, the young John didn't attend a private school, but went to a public one. His teachers and his family's friends regarded him as an optimistic boy who favored playing and fighting much more than minding his studies. After his father's death in the early 1800s, followed by his mother's passing due to tuberculosis  , he began viewing life differently. He wanted to escape the world and did so by reading anything he could get his hands on. At around the age of 16, the teenage John Keats began studying under a surgeon so that he too might become a doctor. However, his literary appetite had taken too much of his fancy, especially with his addiction to the poetry of Ehmund Spenser. He was able to have his first full poem published in the Examiner in 1816, entitled O Solitude! If I Must With Thee Dwell. Within two months in 1817, Keats had written an entire volume of poetry, but was sharply criticized by a magazine. However, the negative response didn't stop his pursuit of rhythm  . John Keats' next work was Endymion, which was published in May 1818. The story involves a shepherd who falls in love with the moon goddess and leads him on an adventure of one boy's hope to overcome the limitations of being human. Following Engymion, however, he tried something more narrative-based and wrote Isabella. During this time, John Keats began seeing his limitations in poetry due to his own limit in life experiences. He would have to have the \"knowledge\" associated with his poems. His next work was Hyperion that would attempt to combine all that he learned.

EU documents must be translated into all these languages, and at official meetings the speeches must be translated into all the languages by interpreters. All this translating is very expensive and time-consuming. It is said that nearly half of all employees of the EU are engaged in translating documents and speeches and nearly half of the EU's administrative   costs are spent on this task. In the near future it is probable that several more countries, most of them having their own languages, will join the EU, thus making the situation even worse. The problem is just cost; there are practical difficulties as well. With 12 languages, there are 132 possible \"translation situations\" that might be needed. It is often difficult to find people in the right place at the right time who can translate from, for example, Danish into Greek, or Dutch into Portuguese, at a high professional standard. In practice the problem has been less serious by the use of English in many contacts between EU officials , since almost all of them speak some English. However, any move to reduce the number of official languages (perhaps to four or five) would be a blow to the pride of the smaller countries.

{"answer": 2, "choices": ["They are allowed to get married at 30", "they can't find jobs to support themselves", "they can't afford a house of their own until then", "they enjoy family life with their parents"], "question": "The British aren't having as many children as they used to. One reason is that people are having children much older than before, meaning they have fewer years in which they can have them. After years at university, they need a few years of work experience before they can get the job they want. They might then get married, but it's incredibly expensive to buy a house in the UK. The above explains why young British people now don't move out of their parents' home until they are around 30 years old on average. It is not until they are 30 that they can afford their own home. Increasingly, it is not until that age that they can afford to get married and start a new life in a new home. It's only after this age that many young people start thinking about having a child. So a British person manages to get a job, get a home and get married. Why isn't he or she then having at least two children on average? The main reason is that it is quite expensive to bring up a child in the UK. Why is it expensive? Well, these days, both parents need to work just to pay for their home and living expenses. Because both parents are at work, that means they then need to pay someone to look after their child during the day. Paying for this childcare is nearly always expensive. The recent financial crisis is making things even harder for families, since unemployment is rising and even fewer people can afford to have children. With so much pressure on families, is it any surprise that the divorce rate is so high? So what is Britain doing to try and save the British family? The government is trying to make it cheaper to have children. For example, there have been increases in money families can claim from the state each month. Also, there are increasing government _ for nursery schools, so that parents do not need to pay so much for child care. The government is also trying to reduce the number of hours British parents have to work to earn enough money to pay their bills. If parents didn't have to work so many hours, they'd have more time to spend with their children and wouldn't need to spend so much on childcare. On average, a Briton works 49 hours a week, which is the most in Europe. The state is now considering introducing laws to encourage companies to improve their employees' work-life balance.

One Sunday, Gavin, a teenager, went skiing at Sugarloaf Mountain in Maine. In the early afternoon, when he was planning to go home, a fierce snowstorm swept into the area. Unable to see far, he accidentally turned off the path. Before he knew it, Gavin was lost, all alone! He didn't have food, water, a phone, or other supplies. He was getting colder by the minute. Gavin had no idea where he was. He tried not to panic. He thought about all of the survival shows he had watched on TV. It was time to put the tips he had learned to use. He decided to stop skiing. There was a better chance of someone finding him if he stayed put. The first thing he did was to find shelter from the freezing wind and snow. If he didn't, his body temperature would get very low, which could quickly kill him. Using his skis, Gavin built a snow cave. He gathered a huge mass of snow and dug out a hole in the middle. Then he piled branches on top of himself, like a blanket, to stay as warm as he could. By that evening, Gavin was really hungry. He ate snow and drank water from a nearby stream so that his body wouldn't lose too much water. Not knowing how much longer he could last, Gavin did the only thing he could -- he huddled   in his cave and slept. The next day, Gavin went out to look for help, but he couldn't find anyone. He followed his tracks and returned to the snow cave, because without shelter, he could die that night. On Tuesday, Gavin went out again to find help. He had walked for about a mile when a volunteer searcher found him. After two days stuck in the snow, Gavin was saved. Gavin might not have survived this snowstorm had it not been for TV. He had often watched Grylls' survival show Man vs. Wild. That's where he learned the tips that saved his life.

One Sunday, Gavin, a teenager, went skiing at Sugarloaf Mountain in Maine. In the early afternoon, when he was planning to go home, a fierce snowstorm swept into the area. Unable to see far, he accidentally turned off the path. Before he knew it, Gavin was lost, all alone! He didn't have food, water, a phone, or other supplies. He was getting colder by the minute. Gavin had no idea where he was. He tried not to panic. He thought about all of the survival shows he had watched on TV. It was time to put the tips he had learned to use. He decided to stop skiing. There was a better chance of someone finding him if he stayed put. The first thing he did was to find shelter from the freezing wind and snow. If he didn't, his body temperature would get very low, which could quickly kill him. Using his skis, Gavin built a snow cave. He gathered a huge mass of snow and dug out a hole in the middle. Then he piled branches on top of himself, like a blanket, to stay as warm as he could. By that evening, Gavin was really hungry.

{"answer": 2, "choices": ["Hunger of the mind", "Stomach and Mind", "Feed your Mind by reading", "Reading or Watching TV"], "question": "If you are hungry, what will you do? Grab a piece of your favorite meal and stay quiet after that? Just like stomach, even your mind will be hungry. But it never lets you know, because you keep it busy thinking about your dream lover, favorite star and many such absurd things. So it silently begins to hide your needs and never lets itself grow. When mind loses its freedom to grow, creativity gets its full stop. This might be the reason why we all sometimes think \"What happens next?\", \"Why can't I think?\", \"Why am I always given the difficult problems?\" Well, this is the after-effect of using our brain for thinking of not-so-worthy things. Hunger of the mind can be actually satisfied through extensive reading. But why is it reading but not watching TV? Because reading has been the most educational tool used by us right from the childhood. Just like that to develop other aspects of our life, we have to turn to reading for help. You have a number of books in the world which will answer all your \"how-to\" questions. Once you read a book, you just don't run your eyes through the lines, but your mind decodes   it and explains it to you. The interesting part of the book is stored in your mind as a seed. Now this seed is unknowingly used by you in your future to develop new ideas. The same seed, if used many times, can help you link and relate a lot of things, which you would never thought of in your wildest dreams! This is nothing but creativity. The more books you read, the wider your mind will become. Also this improves your oratorical (speech-making) skills to a large extent and also makes a significant contribution to your vocabulary. When you start speaking English or any other language fluently with your friends or other people, you never seem to run out of the right words at the right time.

How do you feel if you fail in an exam? Maybe you think it's unfair because you always study hard and should get a good mark. You can't stop blaming yourself. Or, maybe you accept it. You go through the paper carefully, find our why you made stupid mistakes, and tell yourself, \"Take it easy! I'll do better next time!\" Your attitude makes a big difference.

And not about the weather at all. Chatting about the weather with strangers is about emotional comfort (,). When someone says \"Beautiful day today, isn't it?\" as you settle into that narrow elevator space, or at the bus stop, or waiting in line at the supermarket, the conversation is about feelings. The person is speaking to feel more comfortable with you and offering you a chance to feel more comfortable with him or her. Being in close proximity with strangers creates interpersonal tension. We can't help it. Tension automatically seeks resolution. What will you do? Do you notice the person now only a short distance away, or pretend not to notice? Avoidance is one strategy: never make eye contact and act as if nobody is there, even when your feelings tell you. In a supermarket checkout line you might leaf through a magazine. On elevators, we often avoid others by looking up at the floor numbers. The other strategy is to break the tension by noticing the other person. It starts with eye contact. Then we have a choice: smile, nod, make a remark or strike up a conversation. If we choose to talk, the most non-controversial   subject to talk about is the weather.

In many countries, the two sources of heat used for cooking are natural gas or electric stoves. The World Health Organization(WHO) warns that millions of people are dying every year from indoor air pollution. The WHO finds that poor cooking, heating and lighting technologies are killing millions of people each year. Indoor air pollution results from the use of dangerous fuels and cook stoves in the home. WHO officials say nearly three billion people are unable to use clean fuels and technologies for cooking, heating and lighting. And they say more than seven million people die from exposure to indoor or outdoor air pollution each year. Of that number, the WHO says about 4.3 million people die from household air pollution given off  by simple biomass and coal stoves. These findings show that the home use of poisonous fuels is to blame for many of these deaths. These fuels include wood, coal, animal waste and so on. Carlos Dora is Coordinator in the WHO' s Department of Public Health, Environmental and Social Determinants of Health. He says people should not use unprocessed coal and kerosene fuel indoors. He says opening a window or door to let out the harmful air will not correct the situation. It will only pollute the outdoors. \"New technologies and clean fuels can rid people of this problem.\" The United Nations found that more than 95 percent of families in sub-Saharan Africa depend on solid fuels for cooking. It says huge populations in India, China and Latin American countries, such as Guatemala and Peru, are also at risk. Nigel Bruce is a professor of Public Health at the University of Liverpool. He says researchers are developing good stoves and other equipment to burn fuels in a more efficient way.\"There are already many technologies for clean fuels available now. An effective and reasonably low-cost ethanol stove that is made by Dometic (a Sweden-based company)is now being tested out.

In many countries, the two sources of heat used for cooking are natural gas or electric stoves. The World Health Organization(WHO) warns that millions of people are dying every year from indoor air pollution. The WHO finds that poor cooking, heating and lighting technologies are killing millions of people each year. Indoor air pollution results from the use of dangerous fuels and cook stoves in the home. WHO officials say nearly three billion people are unable to use clean fuels and technologies for cooking, heating and lighting. And they say more than seven million people die from exposure to indoor or outdoor air pollution each year. Of that number, the WHO says about 4.3 million people die from household air pollution given off  by simple biomass and coal stoves. These findings show that the home use of poisonous fuels is to blame for many of these deaths. These fuels include wood, coal, animal waste and so on.

On the contrary, both their knowledge and experience are enriched. We feel that there are many disadvantages in streaming pupils. It does not take into account the fact that children develop at different rates. It can have a bad effect on both the bright and the not-so-bright child. After all, it can be quite discouraging to be at the bottom of the top grade! Besides, it is rather unusual to grade pupils just according to their intellectual ability. This is only one aspect of their total personality. We are concerned to develop the abilities of all our pupils to the full, not just their academic ability. We also value personal qualities and social skills, and we find that mixed ability teaching contributes to all these aspects of learning. In our classrooms, we work in various ways. The pupils often work in groups: this gives them the opportunity to learn to co-operate, to share, and to develop leadership skills. They also learn how to deal with personal problems as well as learning how to think, to make decisions, to analyze and evaluate, and to communicate effectively. The pupils learn from each other as well as from the teacher. Sometimes the pupils work in pairs; sometimes they work on individual tasks and assignments, and they can do this at their own speed. They also have some formal class teaching when this is proper. We encourage our pupils to use the library, and we teach them the skills they need in order to do this efficiently. And advanced pupil can do advanced work. It doesn't matter what age the child is. We expect our pupils to do their best, not their least, and we give them every encouragement to obtain this goal.

Iris scanning and other technologies, such as fingerprint and voice scanning, have appeared in many science fiction movies in the past. Today, these advanced technologies are part of the real world. They are common at work, the bank, the airport, and your local prison. The iris scan, fingerprint scan, and voice scan are all examples of biometrics , a fast developing area of automatic personal identification technology. Basically, biometrics uses various ways to verify a person's identity, based on the individual's unique characteristics, including fingerprints, signature, and so on. Biometrics identification systems have a number of advantages over password systems. The primary advantage is that an individual has to be physically present in order to be identified. Another important advantage is that there are no passwords to remember, forget, lose, or steal. The voice scan is the simplest and most affordable form of biometrics. It only requires a computer, a microphone, and the correct software. The software records a subject's voice and then compares it to a stored voice sample for identification purpose. For additional safety, fingerprint and handprint scans can also be employed. Fingerprint scans take the image of a fingerprint and compare it to a stored file of prints.

The second option also involved going over to the shelf but, this time, removing the book and then holding onto it for just an extra moment before placing it in the customer's hands.Of the 20 people who were handed the book, 13 ended up buying it.Just physically passing the book showed a big difference in sales.Why?

A recent study also showed the power of touch, in this case when it came to traditional mail.A deeper and longer-lasting impression of a message was formed when delivered ill a letter, as opposed to receiving the same message online.Brain images showed that, on touching the paper, the emotional center of the brain was activated, thus forming a stronger bond.The study also indicated that once touch becomes part of the process, it could translate into a sense of possession.

Munafo and his colleagues conducted a series of experiments involving normal adults and highly aggressive teens referred to a youth program, either by educational authorities or the courts. About 70% of the teens already had a criminal record. In the first experiment, 40 healthy adults, aged 1830, looked at facial expressions on the computer ranging from happy to angry with increasingly difficult ones to _ in between. Participants were asked how angry they felt and then had to rate the images as displaying either happiness or anger -- there was no option for \"unclear\" or \"unable to tell\". From these ratings, the scientists could generate a score of their preference toward happiness or anger. Previous research found that aggressive people -- including violent offenders -- tend to consider even a common expression as an unfriendly one. \"You looking at me?\" can easily turn a simple question into a tragic fight. Based on their original scores, half of the participants were then told by the computer that some of the unclear faces that they had rated as angry should have been scored as happy. This was intended to guide them toward judging the inbetween faces more positively. The other 20 received feedback that simply proved their first choices, creating a control group. After this training, both groups were tested again and the group that received the biased   feedback shifted its ratings of unclear faces toward the happy side. Participants were also asked to rate their level of angry feelings again after completing the second round of testing. Those who were trained to consider unclear faces as happier reported feeling less angry afterward. The researchers next focused on the 46 adolescents from the high risk youth program. These teens completed the same testing, but both the youth and the staff reported on the teens' levels of aggressive behavior before the testing started and for two weeks afterward.

It leans because of a mistake. It has leaned almost since the day the tower was built. In 1173, the people of Pisa, Italy, wanted to build a bell tower. They wanted the tower to be the most beautiful bell tower in all of Italy. The city also needed a bell tower because the church did not have one. However, there was a problem. As soon as the first floor of the building was finished, the tower started to lean. Builders tried to make the building straight again as they added more floors, but they couldn't figure out how to make it stop leaning. It took almost 180 years to finish the tower. Since then, the tower has leaned by another millimeter every year. Today, the Leaning Tower has eight floors and is 54.5 meters tall. By 1990, it was leaning by about 4 meters to one side. It was also slowly sinking into the ground. Many people became worried that it would soon fall apart. In 1998, repair works began on the tower, and by the end of 2001, it had been moved back by 45 centimeters. The tower will still lean, however, so it will need to be repaired again---in another 200 years. why did the people of  Pisa want to build the tower?", "subject": ""}

Once while being prepared for a television interview, I was chatting with the host about stay-at-home fathers. I made the point that one reason we're seeing more stay-at-home dads may be that it's no longer a given (a known fact) that a man makes more money than his wife. Many families now take earning power into account when deciding which parent will stay home. At that point, one of the male crew members commented, almost to himself but loud enough for my benefits, \"It should be the better parent who stays at home\". A lot of guys say things like that. I was a stay-at-home father for eight years, so what he said made me excited. It implied that our family's choice could only have been correct if I was a \"better\" parent than my wife. I think men shoot themselves in the foot with this kind of thinking. I suppose an argument could have been made that when I began staying home my wife was the \"better\" parent: she had spent more time with our son, could read him better and calm him more quickly. And given a choice, he'd have picked her over me. But as she was the more employable one, my wife went out to work and I looked after our son. Know what? I caught up. Because of the increased time I spent with him, I soon knew him well, understood what he needed and could look after him more or less as my wife could.  Actually, the experience helped me unlock one of the world's great secrets: Women are good at looking after the children because they do it.

The BBC English Dictionary contains background information on 1,000 people and places prominent in the news since 1988; the Oxford Advanced Learner's Dictionary: Encyclopedic Edition is the OALD plus encyclopedic entries; the Longman Dictionary of English Language and Culture is the LDOCE plus cultural information. The key fact is that all three dictionaries can be seen to have a distinctly \"cultural\" as well as language learning content. That being said, the way in which they approach the cultural element is not identical, making direct comparisons between the three difficult. While there is some common ground between the encyclopedic/cultural entries for the Oxford and Longman dictionaries, there is a clear difference. Oxford lays claim to being encyclopedic on content whereas Longman distinctly concentrates on the language and culture of the English speaking world. The Oxford dictionary can therefore stand more vigorous scrutiny   for cultural bias than the Longman publication because the latter does not hesitate about viewing the rest of the world from the cultural perspectives of the English-speaking world. The cultural objectives of the BBC dictionary are in turn more distinct still.

In one study 177 people each spent 24 hours in a room in the institute where the amount of energy is measured by their oxygen and carbon dioxide levels. By the end of the day, some people had burned up 800 calories in toe-tapping, (moving the front part of your foot up and down) finger-drumming (hitting your fingers continuously and lightly against something hard) and other nervous habits. However, others had burned up only 100 calories.   The researchers found that slim women fidget more than fat women, but there was no significant difference in men.

Few would argue with Ford's statement. A brief glimpse at a daily newspaper vividly shows how much people in the United States think about business. For example, nearly every newspaper has a business section, in which the deals and projects, finances and management, stock prices and labor problems of corporations are reported daily. In addition, business news can appear in every other section. Most national news has an important financial aspect to it. Welfare, foreign aid, the federal budget, and the policies of the Federal Reserve Bank are all heavily affected by business. Moreover, business news appears in some of the unlikeliest places. The world of arts and entertainment is often referred to as\"the entertainment industry\"or\"show business.\" The positive side of Henry Ford's statement can be seen in the prosperity that business has brought to U.S. life. One of the most important reasons so many people from all over the world come to live in the United States is the dream of a better job. Jobs are produced in abundance because the U.S. economic system is driven by competition. People believe that this system creates more wealth, more jobs, and a materially better way of life.

A dozen new-style schools are designed to act as a bridge to the workplace and cut the number of NEETs--young people not in education, employment or training. Under plans, schools will operate longer days and work outside standard academic terms. Each pupil will be expected to spend between four hours and two days a week on work placements with businesses linked to the school and teenagers will be assigned a personal coach to act as an academic \"line manager\".     The reforms are put forward due to the fears that too many teenagers are now finishing full-time education lacking the skills needed to succeed in the workplace.

And the number of NEETs has hit a record high, with almost one-in-five young people being left without a job or training place.

However, according to the International Energy Agency and the World Bank, more than a billion people in the world still do not have access to electricity. After sunset, most of them use candles or oil lamps. A company in the Netherlands is trying to change that with its products based on LEDs. When darkness falls, many kids in rural parts of Haiti, Rwanda, or refugee camps in Syria read or do their homework by candlelight or a kerosene -burning lamp. The open flames sometimes cause fires, while poisonous gases lead to respiratory problems. Portable electric light is safer, healthier and now, even cheaper. \"This is the first time that artificial light or solar LED is now less expensive than kerosene,\" said Camille van Gestel, head of a Dutch company called WakaWaka, over Skype. He added WakaWaka, which means \"Shine Bright\" in Swahili, is the most efficient solar-powered light and phone charger in the world today. When fully charged, it shines for up to 16 hours. It is affordable, sustainable, and its battery lasts for a long time. It can be set up on any flat surface, hung from a ceiling or set on top of a glass bottle. Van Gestel said his company operates like any other business, but some of the money made from selling its products is used to make WakaWaka lights affordable to poor people. He said the plan is supported by international non-government organizations. \"The International Rescue Committee was one of the first to actually take the WakaWaka power into Syria, to provide light and power for Syrian refugees, and now the WakaWaka is the most valued non-food item in Syria,\" said Van Gestel. In the past 24 months, the company has distributed around 300,000 units in places such as Syria, Hati, Rwanda, Indonesia and the Philippines. Its goal is to reach 1.2 billion people by 2030.

Its job is to help protect agricultural and other resources from threats and damage by wildlife. Often that means helping farmers deal with unwelcome visitors. This organization has experts from different fields and it has set up thousands of inquiry agencies all over the country where farmers can explain their difficulty and get practical help. ks5u   One example from Wildlife Services of its work involved a farmer in Washington State, in the Pacific Northwest. Several years ago, thousands of Canada geese landed on his fields. The geese began to eat his carrot crop. Biologists from the program suggested that the farmer use noise-making devices and other measures to scare the large birds away. These efforts apparently succeeded, which made the farmer quite happy. Wildlife Services also has a livestock  protection program. The program just offers suggestions to keep those  _ away instead of killing them. The Wildlife Services program is part of the Animal and Plant Health Inspection Service, or APHIS. APHIS offers some suggestions of ways to keep away predators  .For example, try to keep food and water safe from wildlife. Fences may help keep out coyotes , especially if the fences are at least two meters high. For best results, the bottom of the fence should extend about fifteen centimeters into the ground. Experts suggest providing secure shelter for chickens, sheep and other animals that could be attacked. The experts also suggest using lights above places where animals are kept. And they advise people who see coyotes around their property to chase them away by shouting, making loud noises or throwing rocks. For home gardeners, a two-meter fence might help keep out deer. To keep out rabbits, a wire fence has to be only about a half-meter high. It should extend fifteen centimeters underground to keep rabbits from digging under it. If snakes are a problem, remove dead trees and cut high grass to destroy their hiding places. And to protect livestock, consider using guard animals such as dogs and donkeys, which are very effective. Due to its effective work, ever since the Wildlife Services was started, it has been well received by farmers all over the States and neighboring countries such as Canada and Mexico.

{"answer": 0, "choices": ["Their academic career can benefit from it.", "It is an access to better wine cellars.", "Reasons beside glory.", "They can win honour."], "question": "Most academics would view a post at an elite university like Oxford or Harvard as the crowning achievement of a career--bringing both honour and access to better wine cellars. But scholars desire such places for reasons beyond glory. They believe perching on one of the topmost branches of the academic tree will also improve the quality of their work, by bringing them together with other geniuses with whom they can collaborate and who may help spark new ideas. This sounds reasonable. Unfortunately,as Albert Laszlo Barabasi of Northeastern University,in Boston (and also, it must be said, of Harvard), shows in a study published in Scientific Reports, it is not true. Dr Barabasi and his team examined the careers of physicists who began publishing between 1950 and 1980 and continued to do so for at least 20 years. They ranked the impact of the institutions these people attended by counting the number of citations each institution's papers received within five years of publication. By tracking the association of individual physicists and counting their citations in a similar way, Dr Barabasi was able to work out whether moving from a low to a high-ranking university improved a physicist's impact. In total, he and his team analysed 2,725 careers. They found that, though an average physicist moved once or twice during his career, moving from a low-rank university to an elite one did not increase his scientific impact. Going in the opposite direction, however, did have a small negative influence. The consequence is that elite university do not,at least as far as physicists are concerned,add value to output. That surprising conclusion is one which the authorities in countries such as Britain, who are seeking to concentrate expensive subjects such as physics in fewer, more elite institutions--partly to save money, but also to create what are seen as centers of excellence--might wish to consider.

Three men and three women will spend eight months living in a special place on the side of a volcano in Hawaii. They are part of an experiment that is designed to mimic life on Mars. Their mission began on October 15, 2014. NASA says it could send astronauts to Mars as early as the 2030s. The mission would take more than two years, so NASA needs to know how people would react to living in a small group, isolated from the rest of the world, for such a long time. Some people may become depressed or bored living under those conditions. By studying people living in similar conditions here on Eares NASA hopes to learn how to choose the most suitable people for a space mission, and how to help them get along. They will live in a two-story building. The ground floor is about 86 square meters, roughly the size of a small two-bedroom apartment. It includes shared areas like kitchen, dining room, bathroom, laboratory and an exercise room. The upstairs is less than half the size of the downstairs. It contains another bathroom and six small bedrooms. The building is located in an abandoned quarry about 2,400 meters up the side of Mauna Loa, the second biggest volcano in the world. It is constantly monitored for signs of volcanic activity. NASA chose the location because the appearance looks very similar to Mars. To make it more like being on Mars in the future, they are only able to communicate by email during the experiment. Meanwhile, there will be a 20-minute delay between the time when a message is sent and that when it is received. When they go outside, they will have to suit up in full spacesuits, just as if they were on Mars. The commander is Martha Lenio, a 34-year-old Canadian.

Being with both parents in the earliest years of life leads to a child developing more brain cells, the scientists believe. Being brought up by both parents causes boys to have better memory and learning functions. By contrast, it causes girls to develop improved co-ordination and sociability. It is believed that babies with two parents tend to get more attention and more stability , and that they are less likely to suffer emotional distress  in the first years of life. This leads to greater brain cell production ------ for boys it is grey matter brain cells that develop and for girls is white matter brain cells. The researchers from Canada studied mice and experimented by creating one-parent and two-parent family groups. They then measured the offspring's  brain cell development from birth to adulthood. Adult mice with the highest number of brain cells turned out to be those who had been brought up by two parents rather than one. As babies they had received more attention and more nursing as both parents took turns to lick and tend to their youngsters, said Dr Samuel Weiss. As a result, the babies with two parents are less likely to suffer early life hurt which can have a massive impact on how their brains develop in later life, the research shows. However, what did surprise the researchers is that female babies who grew up with both parents turned out to be good single mothers, as if good parenting was passed on. The researchers said,\" In the mouse model, parenting and the environment directly _ adult brain cell production.

The problem is so bad that urgent measures are needed, warns the study, led by British and Chinese researchers. The investigation surveyed 2,191 pupils aged nine to 12 in nine schools in urban and rural Zhejiang, a  ly prosperous coastal province in eastern China.     Eighty-one percent of the youngsters said they worried \"a lot\" about exams, 63 percent feared being punished by their teacher, 44 percent had been physically bullied at least sometimes - with boys likelier to be victims than girls - and 73 percent had been physically punished by their parents. Most of the children complained they struggled to cope with the amount of homework they were assigned. Over one-third reported headaches or abdominal pains - psychosomatic symptoms of stress - at least once a week. The most stressed children reported incidence of aches or pains of four times a week. The investigation, led by Therese Hesketh, a professor at University College London (UCL) Centre for International Health and Development, pointed the finger at extreme competitiveness in China's education system, from the onset of primary school. \"The competitive and punitive educational environment leads to high levels of stress and psychosomatic symptoms,\" the authors say. \"Measures to reduce unnecessary stress on children in schools should be introduced urgently.\" The paper appears in Archives of Disease in Childhood, a peer-reviewed journal of the British Medical Association (BMA). The \"urban\" setting for the study was Hangzhou, the provincial capital of Zhejiang, while the \"rural\" setting was a poor county in Quzhou prefecture, in the west of the province. The study highlights some of the complexities that, it says, explain the demands for academic excellence and intolerance of failure. One factor is the country's dramatic rise in prosperity, which has created \"previously unheard-off possibilities for upward mobility\" and in turn stoked pressures on children to do well at school. Other reasons are China's one-child policy and the Confucian traditions of respect for parents and elders, filial piety, obedience and discipline. \"The aspirations of many parents, who had limited educational opportunities themselves are now invested in their only children,\" it says.

Eighty-one percent of the youngsters said they worried \"a lot\" about exams, 63 percent feared being punished by their teacher, 44 percent had been physically bullied at least sometimes - with boys likelier to be victims than girls - and 73 percent had been physically punished by their parents. Most of the children complained they struggled to cope with the amount of homework they were assigned. Over one-third reported headaches or abdominal pains - psychosomatic symptoms of stress - at least once a week. The most stressed children reported incidence of aches or pains of four times a week. The investigation, led by Therese Hesketh, a professor at University College London (UCL) Centre for International Health and Development, pointed the finger at extreme competitiveness in China's education system, from the onset of primary school. \"The competitive and punitive educational environment leads to high levels of stress and psychosomatic symptoms,\" the authors say. \"Measures to reduce unnecessary stress on children in schools should be introduced urgently.\" The paper appears in Archives of Disease in Childhood, a peer-reviewed journal of the British Medical Association (BMA). The \"urban\" setting for the study was Hangzhou, the provincial capital of Zhejiang, while the \"rural\" setting was a poor county in Quzhou prefecture, in the west of the province. The study highlights some of the complexities that, it says, explain the demands for academic excellence and intolerance of failure. One factor is the country's dramatic rise in prosperity, which has created \"previously unheard-off possibilities for upward mobility\" and in turn stoked pressures on children to do well at school. Other reasons are China's one-child policy and the Confucian traditions of respect for parents and elders, filial piety, obedience and discipline. \"The aspirations of many parents, who had limited educational opportunities themselves are now invested in their only children,\" it says. Previous studies on school-related stress and its impact on health are few and generally come from Scandinavia. A 2008 assessment among 10- to 13-year-old in Sweden found that 21 percent of boys of 30 percent of girls experienced headache, and 17 percent of boys and 28 percent of girls experienced abdominal pain at least once per week.

The European name for the flower is a misuse of the Persian word for turban , a mistake probably arising in the common Turkish custom of wearing flowers in the folds of the turban. Alternatively, the misuse may have arisen because this eastern flower, when not yet in full bloom, looks like a turban. In Persia, to give a red tulip was to declare your love for someone. The black center of the red tulip was said to represent the lover's heart, burned to a coal by love's passion. Originally growing in the Ottoman Empire (present-day Turkey), tulips were imported into Holland in the sixteenth century. When Carolus Clusius wrote the first major book on tulips in 1592, they became so popular that the tulips in his garden were stolen from time to time. As the Dutch Golden Age grew, so did this colorful flower. They were commonly seen in paintings and at festivals. In the mid-seventeenth century, tulips even created the first economics bubble , known as \"Tulip Mania\". At that time, tulips were so expensive that they were used as money until the market for them crashed. Today, Holland is still known for its tulips and other flowers, often sincerely called \"the flower shop of the world.\" Tulips are planted in great fields of beautiful color, and transform the landscape into a sea of different colors. Tulip festivals are held throughout the country in spring. However, the most well-known tulip festival is organized in the Noordoostpolder, a province in the central Netherlands, each year. Held in the middle of the tulip fields, this flower festival runs from late April to early May. The Dutch people took their love of tulips abroad when they settled, and tulips and tulip festivals are now found in New York and Michigan, where the connection to their Dutch roots is still very strong.

Now, away from that ocean, in the hospital bed, his body began to look like a beached fish. His condition went from fair to stable and from stable to serious. Friends went from saying, \"He'll be home in a day\" to \"He'll be home in a week.\" In his father's absence, Eddie helped out at the pier  , working evenings after his taxi job.               When Eddie was a teenager, if he ever complained or seemed bored with the pier, his father would shout, \"What? This isn't good enough for you?\" And later, when he'd suggested Eddie take a job there after high school, Eddie almost laughed, and his father again said, \"What? This isn't good enough for you?\" And before Eddie went to war, when he'd talked of marrying Marguerite and becoming an engineer, his father said, \"What? This isn't good enough for you?\"               And now, regardless of all that, here he was, at the pier, doing his father's labor.               Parents rarely let go of their children, so children let go of them. They move on. They move away. It is not until much later, as the heart weakens, that children understand; their stories, and all their accomplishments, sit on top of the stories of their mothers and fathers, stones upon stones, beneath the waters of their lives.               Finally, one night, at his mother's urging, Eddie visited the hospital. He entered the room slowly.

In the weeks that followed, Eddie's mother lived in a confused state. She spoke to her husband as if he were still there. She yelled at him to turn down the radio. She cooked enough food for two. One night, when Eddie offered to help with the dishes, she said. \"Your father will put them away.\" Eddie put a hand on her shoulder. \"Ma,\" he said, softly, \"Dad's gone.\"               \"Gone where?\" From the last part of the passage, we learn that   _  .", "subject": ""}

Three to five years after quitting, the possibility of getting lung cancer is reduced by half. Warning signs of lung cancer can also be mixed with symptoms connected with long-term smoking. The three main warning signs are an increase of coughing that doesn't clear up, coughing up blood and sharp chest pains. People with those symptoms should see a doctor. Raghavan said there have been promising developments in the treatment of lung cancer, including uses of radiation and surgery and drugs. \"But the fact is that stopping smoking is the most important thing we can do,\" Raghavan said. \"There is no treatment that even comes close.\" To fight against lung cancer, what matters much to smokers is   _  .", "subject": ""}

When the coast was clear,I grabbed the object. It was the cache!

Officials from the university are reluctant  to give interviews. \"We had a hard time calming down students who were shocked at the suicides,\" said Zhang Jingyuan, head of HUST's center for research and guidance for students' development. \"Media coverage  may arouse some students' negative emotions again. Suicide can be contagious ,\" Zhang said. The university reacted promptly to the first suicide on October 23. Advisors and class leaders conducted dorm-to-dorm checks to find students suffering depression. Then psychologists offered one-on-one counseling to them. Notice boards publicizing tips for identifying peers' mental problems and offering help were set up in front of dorm buildings. Leaflets  carrying similar information were handed out to each dorm. However, the second suicide came seven days later. Both students were described as men of few words. Their schoolmates didn't see anything to indicate suicide. Zhang revealed that the two students had been bothered by mental disorders. But the school didn't know this until the students' close friends outside school and their parents unveiled  the truth after the suicides. According to Zhang, there are only three full-time counselors  working in the university's counseling center for its 60,000 students. He complained: \"It's unrealistic to rely only on counselors to detect students' mental problems.\" Some universities in the US may be able to offer solutions to Zhang's worries. They have established programs to train students to be the bridge between troubled friends and counselors. At Worcester Polytechnic Institute, at Worcester, Massachusetts, US, young people in the Student Support Network role play to learn how to detect SOS signals from their schoolmates. They also practice how to gently persuade emotionally troubled students to go for professional help. To develop such empathy , many universities in China have organized campus events to popularize knowledge about mental health. But these are not that attractive to students. Ke Juanjuan, 24, is pursuing a master's degree in English translation at HUST. Ke has found that few of her peers will pay attention to activities about mental health when they are not troubled by it. Rather than bombard students with the words \"mental health\", Ke suggested the school organize lectures and workshops concerning study, job-hunting and relationships. She explained: \"Students care about these topics. They tend to have problems in these areas and may thus get stuck in depression. \"By helping students better deal with these problems, the school can effectively prevent self-inflicted injury and suicide among students.\" Effective prevention comes from long-term education for life instead of temporary intervention  to meet an emergency, said Hu Yi'an. Hu delivers a course of lectures on life and death at Guangzhou University.

Ke Juanjuan, 24, is pursuing a master's degree in English translation at HUST. Ke has found that few of her peers will pay attention to activities about mental health when they are not troubled by it. Rather than bombard students with the words \"mental health\", Ke suggested the school organize lectures and workshops concerning study, job-hunting and relationships. She explained: \"Students care about these topics. They tend to have problems in these areas and may thus get stuck in depression. \"By helping students better deal with these problems, the school can effectively prevent self-inflicted injury and suicide among students.\" Effective prevention comes from long-term education for life instead of temporary intervention  to meet an emergency, said Hu Yi'an.

He worries that universities have paid little attention to education for life. \"Education for life helps students respect and love life so they won't resort  to ending their lives when they have difficulties,\" said Hu.

Officials from the university are reluctant  to give interviews. \"We had a hard time calming down students who were shocked at the suicides,\" said Zhang Jingyuan, head of HUST's center for research and guidance for students' development. \"Media coverage  may arouse some students' negative emotions again. Suicide can be contagious ,\" Zhang said. The university reacted promptly to the first suicide on October 23. Advisors and class leaders conducted dorm-to-dorm checks to find students suffering depression. Then psychologists offered one-on-one counseling to them. Notice boards publicizing tips for identifying peers' mental problems and offering help were set up in front of dorm buildings. Leaflets  carrying similar information were handed out to each dorm. However, the second suicide came seven days later. Both students were described as men of few words. Their schoolmates didn't see anything to indicate suicide. Zhang revealed that the two students had been bothered by mental disorders. But the school didn't know this until the students' close friends outside school and their parents unveiled  the truth after the suicides. According to Zhang, there are only three full-time counselors  working in the university's counseling center for its 60,000 students. He complained: \"It's unrealistic to rely only on counselors to detect students' mental problems.\" Some universities in the US may be able to offer solutions to Zhang's worries. They have established programs to train students to be the bridge between troubled friends and counselors. At Worcester Polytechnic Institute, at Worcester, Massachusetts, US, young people in the Student Support Network role play to learn how to detect SOS signals from their schoolmates. They also practice how to gently persuade emotionally troubled students to go for professional help.

{"answer": 3, "choices": ["India", "Britain", "China", "Italy"], "question": "Many people take it for granted that black is a color of bad things while white should always mean something good. This may be because, in their opinion, black is related to darkness and white to purity. However, that is not always the case. Did you know that the same one color may mean something differently in different places of the world? In the English-speaking world, black is the color of mourning--people wear black at the funeral. Red is concerned with danger or bloodshed . Yellow is the word for fear. If you are afraid, you are yellow. Yet none of these sayings is true outside the English-speaking world. In China and Korea white is the color of mourning. In Russia, China and some other countries, red stands for beauty, life and excellence. In Italy and Germany, you are yellow with anger, not with fear. Even within the English-speaking area, it is not difficult to find color contradictions .A redcap in the United States is a porter in a railway station. In Britain, however, a redcap is a military policeman. Both names are logical, because both men wear red caps. Similarly, the British term for an American white-collar worker is sometimes called a black-coated worker. One does not have to cross an area to find color differences. Would you rather be red-blooded or a blue-blooded? If we go back to the origin, we find that both terms are logical as both names suggest. The expression \"blueblood\" comes from Spain, where some noble families proudly told the world that they had \"blue blood\". Actually they meant that they had no Moorish or Jewish blood. But then why \"blue\" blood? Because they were fair-skinned, and it is only natural that their blood vessels  stood out appearing blue. Yellow is concerned with anger in   _  .", "subject": ""}
