There is no television on Thursdays or during the entire month of July, and only three hours of black-and-white TV the rest of the time. There is no hard liquor on Wednesdays and no beer at any time. There are no handguns; only one jail of thirty-five cells  in the entire land - an admirable figure, even for a small country of 313,376 people. There is no army, air force or navy. There is no tipping for anything. There are no large stores open on Saturdays or Sundays. Since Iceland is situated just under the Arctic Circle, there is no darkness in summer and do daylight in winter. But thanks to Gulf Stream, the climate is rather mild, with temperatures ranging from 34 degrees Fahrenheit to 52 degrees in July. The rules on television, liquor, and guns are the result of governmental decision. But the absence of pollution is due in great part to the fact that Iceland gets its power from the enormous geyser and the thousands of hot springs that come out of the ground. They provide all the energy needed by the country. In fact, Iceland uses only 3 percent of all its available power. Iceland has been described as a democratic   independent country where more fish are caught and more books published per person than anywhere else in the world. The Icelanders have always felt a particular love for literature. They composed their first works in the ninth and tenth centuries AD. These works were poems and tales about the kings, heroes, and heroines of Iceland and Norway. At first the stories were memorized and passed from generation to generation. The Icelanders have never stopped writing ever since. \"Rather shoeless than bookless,\" they proudly say. Rather shoeless than bookless means  _  .", "subject": ""}

People traveled by balloon 100 years before there were planes or jet aircraft. Those early days of ballooning were exciting, but they were also dangerous. Sometimes the balloons fell suddenly. Sometimes they burned. However, the danger did not stop the balloonists. The first real balloon flight was in France in 1783. Two Frenchmen, the Montgolfier brothers, made a balloon. They filled a very large paper bag with hot air.  Hot air is lighter than cold air, so it goes up. The Montgolfier's hot air balloon went up 1,000 feet in the sky. Later that same year, two other Frenchmen ascended   in a basket under a balloon. They built a fire under the balloon to make the air hot. This made the balloon stay up in the air for a few hours. But their balloon was tied to the ground. So it could not go anywhere. The first free balloon flight was in December, 1783. The balloon flew for 25 minutes over Paris. It traveled about 5.5 miles. Flying a balloon is not like flying a plane. The balloon has no engine and therefore no power of its own. The wind directs the balloon. It goes where the wind blows. The pilot can control only the altitude of the balloon to find the right wind direction. That is how a good pilot controls where the balloons goes. Soon balloonists tried longer flights.

Fulton's Social Security Card and bicycle license, bearing the address where he lived during his teenage years, were positioned in their respective compartments, apparently untouched since the year after World War Il ended. Worker Nathan Osborne found the wallet -- along with old homework, lost library books and a 1964 talent show program -- while removing the bleachers for renovations on June 17. It was brought to Fulton's door the following day by Melanie Trindle, the Baker Middle School secretary.

Sequoyah decided to learn how to write his name, so he asked one of his customers to teach him. From then on, Sequoyah signed his work in English. Then Sequoyah realized that a written language was necessary for his people. In 1809, he started by making small drawings, and tried creating a letter for each sound in the Cherokee language. First, Sequoyah picked out all the sounds in the Cherokee language. Then he gave each sound a symbol. Unlike English, however, no two sounds shared the same symbol.

Perri Klass and her mother, Sheila Solomon Klass, both gifted professional writers, prove to be ideal co-writers as they examine their decades of motherhood, daughterhood, and the wonderful ways their lives have overlapped  . Perri notes with amazement how closely her own life has mirrored her mother's: both have full-time careers; both have published books, articles, and stories; each has three children; they both love to read. They also love to travel--in fact, they often take trips together. But in truth, the harder they look at their lives, the more they acknowledge their big differences in circumstance and basic nature. A child of the Depression  , Sheila was raised in Brooklyn by parents who considered education a _ for girls. Starting with her college education, she has fought for everything she's ever accomplished. Perri, on the other hand, grew up privileged in the New Jersey suburbs of the 1960s and 1970s. For Sheila, wasting time or money is a crime, and luxury is unthinkable while Perri enjoys the occasional small luxury, but has not been successful at trying to persuade her mother into enjoying even the tiniest thing she likes. Each writing in her own unmistakable voice, Perri and Sheila take turns exploring the joys and pains, the love and bitterness, the minor troubles and lasting respect that have always bonded them together. Sheila describes the adventure of giving birth to Perri in a tiny town in Trinidad where her husband was doing research fieldwork. Perri admits that she can't sort out all the mess in the households, even though she knows it drives her mother crazy.

They can transform a normal-looking actor into a cowboy, a space alien or even a superhero. Costumes for movies are designed and created by a whole team of people, according to Courtney Daniel, a Toronto-based costume designer who worked on the recent movie Night At The Museum. As a designer, she does research to find out what details are needed to make a costume work, and what makes sense for a specific movie. In Night At The Museum, she and a few other designers spent time at libraries and museums studying everything from what cowboys should wear, to what ancient Egyptians and Huns would have put on. Once they got the information they needed, they figured out what fabrics   to use and how to put them together. The designers even changed a few details to make the costumes more \"movie friendly\". For example, more colour and extra touches  helped historical costumes to be alive for kids. One example of this is the costume for the role in the movie Night At The Museum, an Indian woman Sacagawea, which has a shorter skirt and fits more closely than the clothes the real Sacagawea would have worn.

{"answer": 1, "choices": ["offering students more merit-based aid", "revising their financial aid policies", "increasing the amount of financial aid", "changing their admission processes"], "question": "Colleges taking another look at value of merit-based aid Good grades and high tests scores still matter--a lot--to many colleges as they award financial aid. But with low-income students projected to make up an ever-larger share of the college-bound population in coming years, some schools are re-examining whether that aid, typically known as \"merit aid\", is the most effective use of precious institutional dollars. George Washington University in Washington, D.C., for example, said last week that it would cut the value of its average merit scholarships by about one-third and reduce the number of recipients , pouring the savings, about $2.5 million, into need-based aid. Allegheny College in Meadville, Pa., made a similar decision three years ago. Now, Hamilton College in Clinton, N.Y., says it will phase out merit scholarships altogether. No current merit-aid recipients will lose their scholarships, but need-based aid alone will be awarded beginning with students entering in fall 2008. Not all colleges offer merit aid; generally, the more selective a school, the less likely it is to do so. Harvard and Princeton, for example, offer generous need-based packages, but many families who don't meet need eligibility have been willing to pay whatever they must for a big-name school. For small regional colleges that struggle just to fill seats, merit aid can be an important revenue-builder because many recipients still pay enough tuition dollars over and above the scholarship amount to keep the institution running. But for rankings-conscious schools in between, merit aid has served primarily as a tool to recruit top students and to improve their academic profits. \"They're trying to buy students,\" says Skidmore College economist Sandy Baum. Studies show merit aid also tends to benefit disproportionately students who could afford to enroll without it. \"As we look to the future, we see a more pressing need to invest in need-based aid,\" says Monica Inzer, dean of admission and financial aid at Hamilton, which has offered merit scholarships for 10 years. During that time, it rose in US News & World Report's ranking of the best liberal arts colleges, from 25 to 17. Merit aid, which benefited about 75 students a year, or about 4% of its student body, at a cost of about $ 1 million a year, \"served us well,\" Inzer says, but \"to be discounting the price for families that don't need financial aid doesn't feel right any more.\" Need-based aid remains by far the largest share of all student aid, which includes state, federal and institutional grants. But merit aid, offered primarily by schools and states, is growing faster, both overall and at the institutional level. Between 1995-96 and 2003-04, institutional merit aid alone increased 212%, compared with 47% for need-based grants. At least 15 states also offer merit aid, typically in a bid to enroll top students in the state's public institutions. But in recent years, a growing chorus of critics has begun pressuring schools to drop the practice. Recent decisions by Hamilton and others may be \"a sign that people are starting to realize that there's this destructive competition going on,\" says Baum, co-author of a recent College Report that raises concerns about the role of institutional aid not based on need. David Laird, president of the Minnesota Private College Council, says many of his schools would like to reduce their merit aid but fear that in doing so, they would lose top students to their competitors. \"No one can take one-sided action,\" says Laird, who is exploring whether to seek an exemption from federal anti-trust laws so member colleges can discuss how they could jointly reduce merit aid, \"This is a merry-go-round that's going very fast, and none of the institutions believe they can sustain the risks of trying to break away by themselves.\" A complicating factor is that merit aid has become so popular with middle-income families, who don't qualify for need-based aid, that many have come to depend on it. And, as tuitions continue to increase, the line between merit and need blurs. That's one reason Allegheny College doesn't plan to drop merit aid entirely. \"We still believe in rewarding superior achievements and know that these top students truly value the scholarship,\" says Scott Friedhoff, Allegheny's vice president for enrollment. Emory University in Atlanta, which boasts a $4.7 billion endowment , meanwhile, is taking another approach. This year, it announced it would eliminate loans for needy students and cap them for middle-income families. At the same time, it would expand its 28-year-old merit program. \"Yeah, we're playing the merit game,\" acknowledges Tom Lancaster, associate dean for undergraduate education. But it has its strong point, too, he says. \"The fact of the matter is, it's not just about the lowest-income people. It's the average American middle-class family who's being priced out of the market.\" A few words about merit-based aid: Merit-based aid is aid offered to students who achieve excellence in a given area, and is generally known as academic, athletic and artistic merit scholarships. Academic merit scholarships are based on students' grades, GPA and overall academic performance during high school. They are typically meant for students going straight to college right after high school. However, there are scholarships for current college students with exceptional grades as well. These merit scholarships usually help students pay tuition bills, and they can be renewed each year as long as the recipients continue to qualify.

{"answer": 2, "choices": ["improve teaching quality", "boost their enrollments", "attract good students", "increase their revenues"], "question": "Colleges taking another look at value of merit-based aid Good grades and high tests scores still matter--a lot--to many colleges as they award financial aid. But with low-income students projected to make up an ever-larger share of the college-bound population in coming years, some schools are re-examining whether that aid, typically known as \"merit aid\", is the most effective use of precious institutional dollars. George Washington University in Washington, D.C., for example, said last week that it would cut the value of its average merit scholarships by about one-third and reduce the number of recipients , pouring the savings, about $2.5 million, into need-based aid. Allegheny College in Meadville, Pa., made a similar decision three years ago. Now, Hamilton College in Clinton, N.Y., says it will phase out merit scholarships altogether. No current merit-aid recipients will lose their scholarships, but need-based aid alone will be awarded beginning with students entering in fall 2008. Not all colleges offer merit aid; generally, the more selective a school, the less likely it is to do so. Harvard and Princeton, for example, offer generous need-based packages, but many families who don't meet need eligibility have been willing to pay whatever they must for a big-name school. For small regional colleges that struggle just to fill seats, merit aid can be an important revenue-builder because many recipients still pay enough tuition dollars over and above the scholarship amount to keep the institution running. But for rankings-conscious schools in between, merit aid has served primarily as a tool to recruit top students and to improve their academic profits. \"They're trying to buy students,\" says Skidmore College economist Sandy Baum. Studies show merit aid also tends to benefit disproportionately students who could afford to enroll without it. \"As we look to the future, we see a more pressing need to invest in need-based aid,\" says Monica Inzer, dean of admission and financial aid at Hamilton, which has offered merit scholarships for 10 years. During that time, it rose in US News & World Report's ranking of the best liberal arts colleges, from 25 to 17. Merit aid, which benefited about 75 students a year, or about 4% of its student body, at a cost of about $ 1 million a year, \"served us well,\" Inzer says, but \"to be discounting the price for families that don't need financial aid doesn't feel right any more.\" Need-based aid remains by far the largest share of all student aid, which includes state, federal and institutional grants. But merit aid, offered primarily by schools and states, is growing faster, both overall and at the institutional level. Between 1995-96 and 2003-04, institutional merit aid alone increased 212%, compared with 47% for need-based grants. At least 15 states also offer merit aid, typically in a bid to enroll top students in the state's public institutions. But in recent years, a growing chorus of critics has begun pressuring schools to drop the practice. Recent decisions by Hamilton and others may be \"a sign that people are starting to realize that there's this destructive competition going on,\" says Baum, co-author of a recent College Report that raises concerns about the role of institutional aid not based on need. David Laird, president of the Minnesota Private College Council, says many of his schools would like to reduce their merit aid but fear that in doing so, they would lose top students to their competitors. \"No one can take one-sided action,\" says Laird, who is exploring whether to seek an exemption from federal anti-trust laws so member colleges can discuss how they could jointly reduce merit aid, \"This is a merry-go-round that's going very fast, and none of the institutions believe they can sustain the risks of trying to break away by themselves.\" A complicating factor is that merit aid has become so popular with middle-income families, who don't qualify for need-based aid, that many have come to depend on it. And, as tuitions continue to increase, the line between merit and need blurs. That's one reason Allegheny College doesn't plan to drop merit aid entirely. \"We still believe in rewarding superior achievements and know that these top students truly value the scholarship,\" says Scott Friedhoff, Allegheny's vice president for enrollment. Emory University in Atlanta, which boasts a $4.7 billion endowment , meanwhile, is taking another approach. This year, it announced it would eliminate loans for needy students and cap them for middle-income families. At the same time, it would expand its 28-year-old merit program. \"Yeah, we're playing the merit game,\" acknowledges Tom Lancaster, associate dean for undergraduate education. But it has its strong point, too, he says. \"The fact of the matter is, it's not just about the lowest-income people. It's the average American middle-class family who's being priced out of the market.\" A few words about merit-based aid: Merit-based aid is aid offered to students who achieve excellence in a given area, and is generally known as academic, athletic and artistic merit scholarships. Academic merit scholarships are based on students' grades, GPA and overall academic performance during high school. They are typically meant for students going straight to college right after high school. However, there are scholarships for current college students with exceptional grades as well. These merit scholarships usually help students pay tuition bills, and they can be renewed each year as long as the recipients continue to qualify. In some cases, students may need to be recommended by their school or a teacher as part of the qualification process.

Conventional wisdom holds that if we work hard we will be more successful, and if we are more successful, then we'll be happy. If we can just find that great job, win that next promotion, lose those five pounds, happiness will follow. But recent discoveries in the field of positive psychology have shown that this code is actually backward: Happiness fuels success, not the other way around. When we are positive, our brains become more engaged, creative, motivated, energetic, and productive at work. This discovery has been repeatedly borne out by rigid research in psychology and neuroscience , management studies, and the bottom lines of organizations around the globe. In The Happiness Advantage, Shawn Achor, who spent over a decade living, researching, and lecturing at Harvard University, draws on his own research--including one of the largest studies of happiness and potential at Harvard and others at companies like UBS to fix this broken code. Using stories and case studies from his work with CEOs of Fortune 500 in 42 countries, Achor explains how we can reprogram our brains to become more positive in order to gain a competitive ability at work.

Conventional wisdom holds that if we work hard we will be more successful, and if we are more successful, then we'll be happy. If we can just find that great job, win that next promotion, lose those five pounds, happiness will follow. But recent discoveries in the field of positive psychology have shown that this code is actually backward: Happiness fuels success, not the other way around. When we are positive, our brains become more engaged, creative, motivated, energetic, and productive at work. This discovery has been repeatedly borne out by rigid research in psychology and neuroscience , management studies, and the bottom lines of organizations around the globe. In The Happiness Advantage, Shawn Achor, who spent over a decade living, researching, and lecturing at Harvard University, draws on his own research--including one of the largest studies of happiness and potential at Harvard and others at companies like UBS to fix this broken code. Using stories and case studies from his work with CEOs of Fortune 500 in 42 countries, Achor explains how we can reprogram our brains to become more positive in order to gain a competitive ability at work.

If I have learned anything in my 16 years, it is that communication is very important. With any relationship, you need to let other people know how you are feeling. If you are not able to communicate, you drift apart  . When you are mad at your parents, or anyone else, not talking to them doesn't solve anything. Communication begins with the concerns of others. It means that you can't just come home from school, go up to your room and ignore everyone. To keep a good relationship, you must keep communication, even if it's just by writing a note. When dealing with parents, you always have to make them feel good about how they are doing as a parent. If you are trying to make them see something as you see it, tell them that you'll listen to what they have to say, but ask them politely to listen to you. Yelling or walking away only makes the situation worse. This is an example: one night, Sophie went to a street party with her friends. She knew she had to be home by midnight after the fireworks, but she didn't. She was late getting home. Her parents were mad at first, not giving Sophie a chance to explain why she was late.

Film cameras After all, a film camera is basically a light - proof   box. It has a lens   system to focus light onto the film at the back of the camera. Let's suppose that we are outside on a beautiful summer day trying to take a picture of the family dog. We are using a film camera. We finally get the dog to lie still. You point the camera at him. What happens? Light goes into the camera lens and hits the shutter. In other words, nothing happens yet. Now let's say that the dog looks really cute and you decide to snap a picture. What happens? When you press the button, the shutter opens for a very short period of time. A small amount of light passes through and hits the film at the back of the camera. This creates an upside-down and reversed  image on the film. When you finish the roll of the film, you can take it to the photo shop to develop it and you will have a great picture of your dog! Cameras come with different lens lengths. Why does it matter? Many small cameras have shorter focal lengths, which means that there is a small distance between the lens and the place where the light focuses at the back of the camera. This gives you a large view of the area you are taking a picture of. Lenses with a long focal length show a smaller area but allow you to focus on distant objects and make them bigger. They are often called telephoto lenses. A good example of a long focus lens is one that is used by sports photographers to get photos of football players as if they were standing right beside them.

They are often called telephoto lenses. A good example of a long focus lens is one that is used by sports photographers to get photos of football players as if they were standing right beside them.

But Chinese people have now changed their attitude toward beauty contest, although some men will still be shouting that the winner is no more beautiful than his wife or his former girl friend or even his mother in a sour tone. But such men are not shouting for the right reason. The question to be asked is : Why isn't there a Mr. World Beauty Contest? And a further question to be asked is: Does taking part in a beauty contest show a woman's  courage, wisdom and liberation or rather the opposite - a forced choice and a revolting act made under conditions of long-term discrimination? Organizers of such beauty contests claim that the contestants are judged on qualities other than just their physical appearance. But still no answer is given to why there isn't a Mr. Beauty or a Mr. World Contest? Or at least, why isn't that kind of contest popular? Why is it that only women's \"qualities\" need to be recognized but not men's? Think about who is always standing beside a fancy car on show? Is it a boy or a girl?

This Irish American author best known for the Pulitzer Prize-winning autobiography Angela's Ashes that recorded his poor upbringing, died of cancer on Sunday, The New York Times reported. He was 78. Born in New York City, he was the eldest of seven children born to Irish immigrant parents. Angela's Ashes was a memoir that captured an irresponsible, drunkard father with a gift for story-telling. When not drunk, his father was absent, turning his back on a family so poor, McCourt wrote, that they were reduced to burning the furniture in their rented hut to keep warm. His mother struggled to raise her many children after his father left the family. Already struggling when the Great Depression hit, the family moved back to Limerick, where they slipped ever deeper into poverty in the  1930s. Three of McCourt's siblings died of diseases worsened by hunger and the wretchedness of their surroundings. McCourt himself almost died of typhoid  fever as  a child. In Angela's Ashes, he wrote of hunger, a home flooded with rainwater and the unbearable humiliation of seeking handouts from charities in the Irish city.

{"answer": 3, "choices": ["Those who cannot control the amount of credit they use.", "Those who feel sorry for their shopping.", "Those who are occupied in too much shopping.", "Those who just walk around the shopping malls."], "question": "Are you a problem shopper? The answer is \"Yes\", if you or someone else thinks that you sometimes get carried away with shopping. In other words, do you or does someone else think you are occupied in extreme shopping? If people have regrets later about their shopping, or have an \"out-of-control\" feeling about the quantities of what they buy or the amount of credit they use, they may be considered to be problem shoppers. Extreme shopping can lead to a more serious problem - addictive shopping. Addictive shoppers feel driven by the desire to shop and spend money. They experience great tension which drives them to shop and spend money and they feel a \"rush\" during the time they are occupied with the shopping activity. Extreme or addictive shopping may result from long-time unpleasant feelings, of which anxiety, pain and shame are common ones. When we feel bad inside, we often do something to make ourselves feel better. In this case, we often go shopping. A few people shop to relieve their boredom or emptiness. For some people, the motivation is a desire for status, power, beauty or success. Some love to shop as it makes them feel valued in the eyes of the shop assistants. Others shop simply because it makes them forget, at least temporarily, tension, fear or unhappiness in their life. Besides, shopping malls are designed to encourage continual shopping. For instance, there are some malls where you can't see clocks displaying the time because they don't want you to become too aware of the time you spend there. What's more, food courts, coffee shops and restrooms are provided, so you don't have to leave the mall because of your physical needs. Therefore, once you become aware of how market forces work, you will certainly come to control your shopping behavior.

Army Corps of Engineers upriver, his theory aims to look deeper into the root of the problem. \"The Missouri River is flooding,\" said Dr. James Hansen, Director of NASA's Goddard Institute for Space Studies, during a visit to Omaha on Tuesday.\"We've had floods that usually only happen once in every hundred years a couple of times on the Missouri River recently. That's one of the expected consequences of the increasing level of atmospheric carbon dioxide.\" Hansen, who is considered to be one of the world's leading experts on global warming , said the Missouri River is an example of how global warming is affecting the earth .\"Unless you do statistics ,and you see that the frequency of these events is changing , it's not so easy to see that changes are occurring , because the climate system has large inertia  ,\"he said .

The major American accent -- the typical accent of the mid-western US -- is rhotic, and British English is, as a rule, non-rhotic. Specifically, US speakers pronounce every \"r\", wherever they appear in a word. Most British speakers (and you will note that there are some British Isle accents that are strongly rhotic, like US) do not pronounce every \"r\". Americans stress the \"r\" at the end of words such as \"teacher\" or \"neighbour\", but in many non-rhotic British accents it is more of a \"schwa\" (an unstressed sound) so it comes out as, \"teacha\" (unstressed) or \"neighba\". This main difference also differs across the country of origin. For example, the US has a clear difference in the accents between people of the north and south, not to mention less clear differences across the states. Similarly, British people have a different accent according to their locality. The \"cockney  \" accent is greatly different to the middle and upper class accents. Another common difference appears to be that Americans pronounce words such as \"herbal\" without the \"h\".

Some new technologies might make you feel that way. Digital billboards are being created with ability to recognize certain characteristics.

A computer inside the billboard then uses the information to display ads that are directed at the people who are looking at the billboard. For example, if a man passes a billboard featuring an ad for cosmetics, the computer can change the ad to something that is more likely to catch the man's attention, such as football games. While advertisers see this as a great opportunity to reach their target customers, some people feel that this kind of profiling is an invasion of their privacy. People are now much more aware of how information is exposed, shared, bought, and sold on the Internet. Now this debate will involve technologies such as \"smart\" billboards.

Here you can read about some of the most famous cases of art theft in the history. The First Theft: The first documented case of art theft was in 1473, when two panels of altarpiece of the Last Judgment by the Dutch painter Hans Memling were stolen.

Her right leg was cut off above the knee. She felt hungry all the time. When she was old enough to get around, she was forced to clean floors, feed babies and wash dishes. And she had to do all that with an artificial   leg that didn't work well.      When she was 7, a family in Michigan adopted her, giving her an improved artificial leg. It was OK for everyday activities, but she couldn't play soccer or basketball.      When she was 14, she got a high-tech leg made for sports. \"I remember being terrified because that was my first time,\" she said. Scout Bassett was waiting nervously for the race to start when the athlete Sarah Reinertsen came up and said, \"I've been doing this for a while. Let me help you.\"     Reinertsen, who lost her leg when she was 7, works with an organization called the Challenged Athletes Foundation to help people like Scout Bassett. She lost that first race, but  gained confidence from Reinertsen. Training hard, she improved her strength and skill. She even took up golf and tennis.      Now, living in Califomia, Bassett runs competitively and finds time to share her story with school groups. She said, \"Some people think they having nothing in common with me. I want to say everyone has challenges - maybe with homework or friends. No matter what it is, everything you need is inside your heart.

And according to town manager Leslie Stanley, it doesn't look as if things will improve any in the immediate future. \"We've got a real annoying problem on our hands,\" he says. The annoyance began in late May. About three miles outside of town a group of beavers   built a dam near the mouth of a culvert   that carries a stream under Canaan Road. Some 50 feet of roadway and several hundred feet of land on each side of the culvert were flooded. Stanley sent a road crew out to level the dam. The beavers rebuilt it. The crew tore it apart again. In fact, they tore it apart for ten mornings-and for ten straight nights the beavers rebuilt it. On the eleventh day, the foreman tossed   the problem back to the town manager. He, in turn, tossed it on to the local game warden  . The warden, absorbed in beaver knowledge, moved quietly and carefully out one night and placed a petrol-soaked bag over the dam. (Any beaver expert will tell you the creatures just can't tolerate petrol smell.) In the morning the bag was found artistically woven   into the dam. The warden set out three steel traps that night. In the morning one was empty. The other two had been stolen by the beavers and used to strengthen the dam. The warden, cursing the state law against hunting beavers with firearms, got his traps back and set them out again and again. And every night the beavers stole them. Town manager Stanley enlisted additional troops. He telephoned his police chief. Those beavers were breaking a state law against blocking up a natural watercourse. \"Why aren't you out there to _ the law?\" Stanley asked. \"You're the police chief. So remove them. Arrest them. Do something.\" Three mornings later, the police chief proudly announced the end of the dam. At 2:00 A.M., he said, he and a licensed dynamiter   had blown it to small pieces. Stanley said he'd believe it when he saw it. They drove out to the culvert and found a new dam already half-built. They also found the highway choked with mud and remains thrown up by the dynamite. Stanley said maybe they should call in the Army Corps of Engineers. But the police chief's faith in explosives was unshaken. He launched an all-out campaign,but the beavers always managed to have the holes plugged by the time the fire department appeared on the scene for its morning mop-up. In time, the beavers tired of this nonsense and moved their dam \"inside\" the culvert-where it couldn't be blown up without destroying the road too. Stanley and his general staff held a council of war and agreed that fresh strategy was called for. Then they came up with an inspired idea. If we remove every branch of the dam by hand, we'll force the beavers to go in search of new building material to replace what we've taken. Then we can place box traps along their runways and seized them. The plan was completely approved. Moreover it worked. On July 30, town manager Stanley was able to announce that the beaver group had been trapped and removed to a remote wilderness area.

A person might use words that communicate one message and a tone that shows something very different. This possibility for confusion is one reason that businessmen encourage discussing things in person, rather than through email, as tone cannot be determined in the written form. The same rule is true with children. Children as young as a few months respond to a change in voice. It has been recorded that babies prefer to hear a story read by their own mother rather than another woman whom they do not know. Have you ever talked to someone who had little or no changes in their voice no matter what you were discussing? Think of the teacher or professor you had in the past that spoke in a _ manner for the entirelecture. It is very boring and difficult to become interested in the topic. Parents should make an active effort to communicate with your child. If your child figures out how to open a box he or she has been struggling with and says \"YES!\" with pride in his or her voice, your response should be happy and excited (something encouraging, like \"You did it!\"). If you plainly said the same thing, you would not be matching the tone of your child. This applies to feelings that the child may express in everyday situations as well. If a child argues with a friend, your response should not be said in a high voice or with a smile. Seriously and sincerely you should say \"You look sad\" or \"That must have been hard for you\". The tone of your voice expresses understanding, acknowledgement, connection and several other healthy things to your child. Although your words are very important, equally important is the tone with which you say those words. When communicating with their children, what are parents advised to do?", "subject": ""}

The school serves families of children from 6weeks to 6th grade.This allows them to have programs in baby care,preschool,kindergarten,and elementary .The curriculum has developed over the decades,most notably in the Elementary.At first somewhat jokingly referred to as\"Monte-sorta,\"due to its relaxed application of the Montessori Method,the school's elementary now stresses a more traditional Montess environment.Montessori associates abstract concepts with concrete sensorial  experiences,ensuring that children are involved in learning,not just memorization.Classrooms still have a creative,casual feel,with children having freedom of choice,but in keeping with Montessori principles,they work within a framework.This helps them learn about freedom within limits,maximizing their potential. The truly international Rainbow Montessori staff comes from a wide range of backgrounds,all Montessori-trained.\"They are an energetic,devoted group,\"says Dave.\"They are loyal,caring and like what they do a lot.I'd say a good 30to 40percent of them have been here for almost a decade or more.\" Dave says that his favorite part of being at Rainbow Montessori is\"making things grow\".By that,he doesn't mean it in the sense of the organic,but by\"coming up with good solutions to problems as they occur.\"This is reflective of Montessori beliefs,in which each child learns to use the right tools and discover solutions for themselves.Dave credits a strong staff and great parents with lots of patience for helping to make Rainbow Montessori an ideal place for children to learn and grow.

That's why restoring it is a major goal for designers of artificial limbs. In their new study, Bensmaia and his co-workers worked with rhesus monkeys  .

In your down time, educate yourself about the company and its industry. \"Read corporate information, analyst reports and related news articles,\" she says. \"If your boss accepts your suggestions, it will make you a more valuable employee.\" What is the common view about careers of the people mentioned in this passage?", "subject": ""}

As California's drought worsens, swimming pools have become a target for those who think the classic backyard greens waste water. Some water districts have banned new pools from being filled and have limited how much water existing pools can use. But some of those agencies are walking back the rules as they make a surprising discovery: Pools aren't the water wasters some have made them out to be. Analyses by various water districts, along with scientific studies, conclude that pools and their surrounding landscapes use about the same amount of water as a lawn  of the same size. Over time, pools might even use less water. With pool covers, experts say water evaporation can be cut by almost half, making pools significantly less wasteful than grass and about as efficient as drought-tolerant landscaping. Facing complaints over a recent ban on filling pools, the Santa Margarita Water District conducted its own water-use analysis. It found that pools require thousands of gallons of water to fill initially, but they use about 8,000 gallons less water than a traditional landscape after that. By the third year, the analysis found, the savings add up, and a pool's cumulative water use falls below that of a lawn.

At 57, I am feeling a bit lost. I have a wonderful, loving husband and bright, caring teenage daughter but I am lonely and have lost my spark for life. I have always taken care of everyone and managed a career, but, after the death of my father this summer, my difficulties as a child in a terribly abnormal family have come back to me regularly. I have become unfocused and often alone while my husband is away frequently on business and my daughter busy with school and friends. I am seeking the help of a therapist and taking care of myself but I would love to read something to help me \"get my groove  back\" and reengage with life. PC Dear PC, From the letter you've given us about your life, it's no wonder you're feeling a little lost. But before prescribing titles to help you get your groove back, I'd recommend taking a journey into Rebecca Solnit's non-fiction book,A Field Guide to Getting Lost, which is packed with the wisdom of everyone from Pat Barker to Thoreau and Keats. The word lost is rooted in the Old Norse \"los\", meaning the disbanding of an army. \"This origin suggests soldiers falling out of formation to go home, ceasing fighting with the wide world. I worry now that many people never disband their armies, never go beyond what they know,\" Solnit writes. So instead of fearing that lost feeling, try seeing its potential for discovery. Explorers, remember, are always lost simply because they're forever someplace new. \"Leave the door open for the unknown, the door into the dark,\" Solnit advises. \"That's where the most important things come from, where you yourself came from, and where you will go.\" For something that asks a little less of the reader while still giving plenty in return, try a dose (--) of Anne Tyler, the beloved creator of numerous heroes whose serious conditions will move anyone who finds themselves in a midlife difficult situation. One such character is 53-year-old Rebecca Davitch, the heroine ofBack When We Were Grownups. Like you, she's combined marriage and motherhood with a career but suddenly finds herself feeling lonely in her own home. Could it be, she wonders, that she's \"turned into the wrong person\"? Don't be fooled by the way this novel ambles along -- as Rebecca revisits youthful ambitions and the college boyfriend she abandoned, it asks some heart-rending questions before arriving at a place of graceful, joyous acceptance. Along similar lines, I'm also going to recommendThe Unlikely Pilgrimage of Harold Fryby Rachel Joyce. Its hero is 65 when he learns that a former colleague sick. On his way to post her a note,he decides instead to visit her -- on foot, from his home in deepest Devon to England's northernmost town, more than 600 miles away. You don't manage that without focus! It's a journey to a holy place that will take him 87 days to complete, during which he considers his childhood, marriage and relationship with his son, and becomes an accidental media sensation  . By the time he reaches his destination, you'll feel anything but tired. Finally, Ruth Ozeki's novelA Tale for the Time Beingwill charm the missing spark back into your life. Combining the diary of a sad Tokyo teenager with the story of the middle-aged novelist who finds it, washed ashore on a remote island off the coast of British Columbia, it's a beautiful illustration of how our lives touch -- and are touched by -- others in ways we mightn't even be aware of. This \"Man Booker Prize\" finalist has plenty to teach about Zen Buddhism, and unless you happen to live in one of its settings, it provides a bracing change of scene, too. One other suggestion: books, as we all know, make great companions but that doesn't mean they can't be enjoyed in the company of others.

One other suggestion: books, as we all know, make great companions but that doesn't mean they can't be enjoyed in the company of others. If you find yourself home alone, why not slip one into your back pack and head out to a favourite cafe. Which of the following can be the proper title?", "subject": ""}

When I met her father, he began to explain he was too poor once and that he would hate to throw away things that can be very useful. Before he showed me what he was giving away, I thought the toys would be mostly lego's  or things like that. When he was showing me around I saw a bed, a slide, a kitchen set and many other things that just blew my mind. He told me to write a list of everything my daughter could use and as my eyes were wide, he told me not to feel guilty. He said I was helping him by getting rid of the stuff.

More than 90% of the stuff that comes out of a whisky distillery is not whisky. It is leftovers like draff and pot ales -- both produced in the early stages of the process. They are high in sugar and are currently used for things like fertiliser and cattle feed. Napier University's Biofuel Research Centre (BfRC) has already shown that the right bacteria can feed on those by-products to produce butanol--a direct replacement for vehicle fuel. Now the spin-out company, Celtic Renewables, and independent whisky producer Tullibardine have signed an agreement. Together they will apply the process to thousands of tons of the distillery's leftovers. Professor Martin Tangney, founder of Celtic Renewables, said \"Our partnership with Tullibardine is an important step in the development of a business which combines two important Scottish industries -- whisky and renewables.

There are many books about this, especially children books. Now there are also movies, such as Dr. Doolittle. When you watch animals, it seems clear that they can communicate with each other. Many people wonder why people can't also communicate with them.    Scientists know how some animals communicate. Bees, for example, use their bodies. They do a kind of dance to give information about food. Birds, on the other hand, share information with sounds. They use certain sounds to protect their homes and to stay together when they fly. Some male birds use lovely songs to attract a female . Other animals communicate with both body movements and sounds. For example, dogs wag their tails when they are happy, and they bark when they are excited.    People used to think it was possible to teach human language to animals. Parrots and other birds, for example, can learn to say words. But the birds just repeat the words. They don't understand them. Some American scientists tried to teach English to chimpanzees , close  s of human beings. However, this was impossible. Chimpanzees can't move their mouths the right way. They could never learn to speak like people.    Then scientists tried to teach human language to chimpanzees in other ways. Some tried with American Sign Language (ASL).

Heidi, Mrs Bourne said, stayed in bed too late. She complained when she was hungry and was particular about food. She told rude jokes. Finally, she had never thanked Mrs Bourne for the weekend.  But it wasn't just Heidi's behavior that got people talking. Facebook groups started up about the e-mail. The one with the most members was called \"Carolyn Bourne needs to learn some manners\".  People said Mrs Bourne had been too direct. They thought she had been cruel when she told Heidi to go to \"finishing school\" -- a centre where badly-behaved young women used to be sent. Heidi's father wrote back to Mrs Bourne and called her a \"snotty   Miss Fancy Pants\" -- someone who thinks they are socially better than anyone else. Everyone agreed that there are rules of \"good\" and \"bad\" behavior. Everyone agreed that these rules had been broken. However, no one could agree what these rules were -- or whether Heidi or Mrs Bourne was in the wrong. So what does politeness really mean? Is there a secret to social etiquette  ?

But it wasn't just Heidi's behavior that got people talking. Facebook groups started up about the e-mail. The one with the most members was called \"Carolyn Bourne needs to learn some manners\".  People said Mrs Bourne had been too direct. They thought she had been cruel when she told Heidi to go to \"finishing school\" -- a centre where badly-behaved young women used to be sent. Heidi's father wrote back to Mrs Bourne and called her a \"snotty   Miss Fancy Pants\" -- someone who thinks they are socially better than anyone else. Everyone agreed that there are rules of \"good\" and \"bad\" behavior. Everyone agreed that these rules had been broken. However, no one could agree what these rules were -- or whether Heidi or Mrs Bourne was in the wrong. So what does politeness really mean? Is there a secret to social etiquette  ? Shirley Schomaker runs a real-life finishing school. She said that both Mrs Bourne and Heidi had been impolite. The true secret, she said in a BBC interview, lies in making everyone feel comfortable. \"Social etiquette isn't about being snotty and being in the know  ,\" she said. \"It's about making other people feel good.

Most fishes have a swim bladder , which is filled with gas and helps them stay afloat. At the depth that the blobfish live, water pressure is 80 times higher than that at higher sea levels and any swim bladder wouldn't be able to serve its purpose.

Others have told pupils to leave them at home. However, Dr Elizabeth Hartnell-Young at the University of Nottingham believes it is time that phone bans were reassessed--because mobile phones can be a powerful learning aid, they say. \"At the start of the study, even pupils were often surprised at the thought that mobile phones could be used for learning,\" Dr Hartnell-Young says. \"After their hands-on experience, almost all pupils said they had enjoyed the project and felt more motivated. \"Some teachers also had to reassess their views. \"Using this technology gives them more freedom to express themselves without needing to be constantly governed.\" one said. Other teachers found that pupils who lacked confidence gained most from the project. However, they recognized that greater use of mobile phones in schools could prove troublesome. Increased temptation to steal phones was one worry. \"I thought, well, four of these smart phones are going to end up on e-BAY tomorrow,\" one teacher said. A few teachers remained concerned that phones could prove a distraction for some pupils. Allowing pupils to access school emails via mobiles would also bring risks if passwords were shared, they said. Dr Hartnell-Young says that the teachers' worries are understandable. \"While the eventual aim should be to cancel overall bans on phones we do not recommend immediate, whole-school change,\" she said. \"Instead we believe that teachers, students and the wider community should work together to develop policies that will enable this powerful new learning tool to be used safely.

We are embarrassed to draw attention to something that is happening, while in a football match, people get involved, and a fight would easily follow. \" Psychotherapist Alan Dupuy identifies the importance of the individual: \"The British as a whole have some difficulty intervening, but there are exceptional individuals in every group who are prepared to intervene, regardless of their own safety: These would be people with a strong moral code or religious ideals.\" The author wrote this article    _   .", "subject": ""}

Owen, 66, a retired engineer from Hordle, New Milton, Hants, first started work on the 40ft--long boat in 1982 because he could not afford to buy his own. He told mum Edith that it would only take five years but after suffering \"a few problems\" it lasted nearly three decades. When he finally finished, he was left with the head-scratching task of getting the 18-tonne boat out of the back garden. After some time he found a way. A huge crane   was brought in to carefully raise it 40ft in the air over his mother's house and onto a lorry. It was then driven to the seaside and, to Owen's delight, it floated and showed no signs of leaking when lowered into the water. Now, 28 years after he first started, Owen is at last preparing to set sail in his beloved boat, Wight Dolphin, with his long-suffering wife Anne. Owen said, \"I am so relieved that it's finished.

Every immigrant has a double identity and a double vision, being suspended between an old and a new home, an old and new self. The very notion of a new home, of course, is in a sense as impossible as the notion of new parents. Parents are who they are; home is what it is.  Yet home, like parentage, must be legitimized  through love; otherwise, it is only a fact of geography or biology. Most immigrants to America found their love of their old homes betrayed: they did not really abandon their countries; their countries abandoned them. In America, they found the possibility of a new love, the chance to nurture new selves. Not uniformly, not without exceptions. Every generation has its Know-Nothing movement. Its understandable fear and hatred of alien invasion is as true today as it always was, but in spite of all this, the American attitude remains unique. Throughout history, exile has been a disaster; America turned it into a triumph and placed its immigrants in the center of a national epic.  The epic is possible because America is an idea as much as it is a country. America has nothing to do with loyalty to a dynasty and very little to do with loyalty to particular place, but everything to do with loyalty to a set of principles. To immigrants, those principles are especially real because so often they were absent or violated in their native lands. It was no accident in the '60 and '70s, when alienation was in flower, that it often seemed to be \"native\" Americans who felt alienated, while aliens or the children of aliens upheld the native values. The immigrant's double vision results in a special, somewhat skewed perspective on America that can mislead but that can also find revelation in the things that to native Americans are obvious. Psychiatrist Robert Coles speaks of those \"who straddle worlds and make of that very experience a new world.\" \"Home is where you are happy.\" Sentimental, perhaps, and certainly not conventionally patriotic, but is appropriate for a country that wrote the pursuit of happiness into its founding document. That continues for the immigrant in America, and it never stops, but it comes to rest at a certain moment. The moment is hard to pin down, but it occurs perhaps when the immigrant's double life and double vision joint together toward a single state of mind.

Psychiatrist Robert Coles speaks of those \"who straddle worlds and make of that very experience a new world.\" \"Home is where you are happy.\" Sentimental, perhaps, and certainly not conventionally patriotic, but is appropriate for a country that wrote the pursuit of happiness into its founding document. That continues for the immigrant in America, and it never stops, but it comes to rest at a certain moment. The moment is hard to pin down, but it occurs perhaps when the immigrant's double life and double vision joint together toward a single state of mind. When the old life, the old home fade into a certain unreality: places one merely visits, in fact or in the mind, practicing the tourism of memory. It occurs when the immigrant learns his ultimate lesson: above all countries, America, if loved, returns love. What can be the best title of the passage?", "subject": ""}

This was the Bronze Age of the Old World, during which people first developed the art of metallurgy, civilization also arose in other parts of the Old World, first in Egypt, China, and India, and later in Europe and Africa. At this time, civilization also developed independently in the New World, in the Mexican area and in Peru and its adjacent  areas. In the Old World the Bronze Age was followed by the Iron Age, which saw the rise and fall of great empires and the shift of power from the Middle East to Greece and Rome and then to Western Europe. In the 1700s the Industrial Age began, leading directly to the modern civilization of today.

Yet the safety and strength of a flying bike was always a big problem. Over the past 10 years, developments in technology have moved the dream of personal flying vehicles closer to reality. Now, two groups of inventors say such vehicles may be available very soon. Grant Stapleton from Malloy Aeronautics says the Hoverbike, which is able to get in and out of small spaces very quickly, will be a truly personal flying vehicle.  \"It can be moved across continents very quickly because it can be folded and packed,\" he adds. Mr. Stapleton says safety was the company's main concern when developing the Hoverbike. He ays the designers solved the safety issue by using overlapping rotors     to power the vehicle.  The company is testing both a one-third size model and a full-size prototype     of the Hoverbike. Inventors say their Hoverbike will most likely be used first by the police and emergency rescue teams. In New Zealand,  the Martin Aircraft Company is also testing a full-size prototype of its personal flying bike, called Jetpack. It can fly for more than 30 minutes, up t0 1,000 meters high and reach a speed of 74 kilometers per hour. Peter Coker is the CEO of Martin Aircraft Company.

{"answer": 1, "choices": ["helps a student to perform better in the test", "can also be harmful to a person's performance in the test", "helps a student to cope with a challenging situation better", "may be more harmful that getting too worried over tests"], "question": "Have you ever felt so anxious during an examination that you couldn't even put down the answers you knew? If so, you were suffering from what is known as test anxiety. According to psychologist Ralph Trimble, test anxiety is a very real problem for many people. When you're worried over your performance on an exam, your heart beats faster and your pulse speeds up. These reactions start others: You may sweat more than normal or suffer from a stomachache or headache. Your field of vision narrows and becomes tunnel-like. Before you know it, you're having difficulty focusing. \"What I hear students say over and over again,\" says Dr. Trimble, who is working at the Psychological and Counseling Center at the University of Illinois, \"is, 'My mind went blank.'\" For a number of years, Dr. Trimble helped many students learn how to perform better during exams and to bring up their grades. Some of these students were interested in sharing what they learned and, with Trimble's help, began holding workshops on overcoming test anxiety. For many students, just being in a workshop(,) with other sufferers made them feel better. They realized that they were not the only ones who had done poorly on tests because of tension. The workshops were so successful that they are still given. In the workshops, students are taught that anxiety is normal. You just have to prevent it from getting the best of you. The first step is to learn to relax. If before or during an examination you start to panic, stretch as hard as you can, tensing the muscles in your arms and legs; then suddenly relax all of them. This will help relieve tension. But keep in mind that you don't want to be too relaxed. Being completely relaxed is no better than being too tense. \"If you are so calm you don't care how you do on an examination, you won't do well,\" Trimble says. \"There is an optimum level of concern when you perform at your best. Some stress helps. There are people who can't take even slight stress. They have to learn that in a challenging situation, being anxiously excited is good and will help them to do better. But if they call it anxiety and say, 'It's going to hit me again,' that will make them nervous and worried.\" As a student you must also realize that if you leave too much studying until a day or two before the examination, you can't do the impossible and learn it all. Instead, concentrate on what you can do and try to think what questions are likely to be asked and what you can do in the time left for studying. When you sit down to study, set a moderate pace and vary it by reading, writing notes, and going over any papers you have already written for the course, as well as the textbooks and notes you took in class. Review what you know. Take breaks and go to sleep early enough to get a good night's rest before the exam. You should also eat a moderate breakfast or lunch, avoid drinks like coffee and stay away from fellow students who get tense. Panic spreads easily. Get to the exam room a few minutes early so that you will have a chance to familiarize yourself with the surroundings and get out your supplies. When the examination is handed out, read the directions twice and underline the significant instructions, making sure you understand them. Ask the teacher to explain if you don't. First answer the easiest questions, then go back to the more difficult. On essay questions, instead of starting right away, take a few minutes to organize your thoughts, make a brief outline, and then start off with a summary sentence. Keep working steadily, and even when time starts to run out, don't speed up. According to the passage, being completely relaxed before a test   _  .", "subject": ""}

If so, you were suffering from what is known as test anxiety. According to psychologist Ralph Trimble, test anxiety is a very real problem for many people. When you're worried over your performance on an exam, your heart beats faster and your pulse speeds up. These reactions start others: You may sweat more than normal or suffer from a stomachache or headache. Your field of vision narrows and becomes tunnel-like. Before you know it, you're having difficulty focusing. \"What I hear students say over and over again,\" says Dr. Trimble, who is working at the Psychological and Counseling Center at the University of Illinois, \"is, 'My mind went blank.'\" For a number of years, Dr. Trimble helped many students learn how to perform better during exams and to bring up their grades. Some of these students were interested in sharing what they learned and, with Trimble's help, began holding workshops on overcoming test anxiety. For many students, just being in a workshop(,) with other sufferers made them feel better. They realized that they were not the only ones who had done poorly on tests because of tension. The workshops were so successful that they are still given. In the workshops, students are taught that anxiety is normal. You just have to prevent it from getting the best of you. The first step is to learn to relax. If before or during an examination you start to panic, stretch as hard as you can, tensing the muscles in your arms and legs; then suddenly relax all of them.

Proper rest and good nutrition can improve coping skills, so can good parenting. Make time for your kids each day.

It's really hard for some people to come home after a tiring day of work, get down on the floor, and play with their kids or just talk to them about their day -- especially if they've had a stressful day themselves. But expressing interest in your kids shows that they' re important to you. Help your child deal with stress by talking about what may be causing it. Together, you can come up with a few solutions.  For example, he should cut back on after-school activities, spending more time talking with his parents or teachers, developing an exercise plan or keeping a journal. You can also help by predicting potentially stressful situations and preparing kids for them. For example, let a child know ahead of time, but not too far ahead of time, that a doctor's appointment is coming up and talk about what will happen there. Keep in mind, though, that younger kids probably won't need too much advance preparation. Too much information can cause more stress.

{"answer": 3, "choices": ["To define victims and creators.", "To evaluate victims against creators.", "To explain the relationship between victims and creators.", "To suggest the transformation from victims to creators."], "question": "You are given many opportunities in life to choose to be a victim or creator. When you choose to be a victim, the world is a cold and difficult place. \"They\" did things to you which caused all of your pain and suffering. \"They\" are wrong and bad, and life is terrible as long as \"they\" are around. Or you may blame yourself for all your problems, thus internalizing your victimization. The truth is, your life is likely to stay that way as long as you feel a need to blame yourself or others. Those who choose to be creators look at life quite differently. They know there are individuals who might like to control their lives, but they don't let this get in the way. They know they have their weaknesses, yet they don't blame themselves when they fail. Whatever happens, they have choice in the matter. They believe their dance with each sacred moment of life is a gift and that storms are a natural part of life which can bring the rain needed for emotional and spiritual growth. Victims and creators live in the same physical world and deal with many of the same physical realities, yet their experience of life is worlds apart. Victims relish  in anger, guilt, and other emotions that cause others---and even themselves---to feel like victims, too. Creators consciously choose love, inspiration, and other qualities which inspire not only themselves, but all around them. Both victims and creators always have choice to determine the direction of their lives. In reality, all of us play the victim or the creator at various points in our lives. One person, on losing a job or a special relationship, may feel as if it is the end of the world and sink into terrible suffering for months, years, or even a lifetime. Another with the same experience may choose to first experience the grief, then accept the loss and soon move on to be a powerful creative force in his life. In every moment and every circumstance, you can choose to have fuller, richer life by setting a clear intention to transform the victim within, and by inviting into your life the powerful creator that you are.

In the current age of climate confusion, a backup plan is always an essential part of a gardener's intention for an ideal tomato harvest. Where tomatoes are concerned, the best crop insurance is to root some extras from cuttings . It can take a couple of months to grow garden-ready tomato plants from seed , but cuttings can be ready to go in a few weeks. Yes, you could pick up some starts at a garden center, but it's hard to find strong ones in good condition. Instead, buy one tomato plant, and turn it into many. Tomatoes root very quickly and easily. All you do is remove a tiny branch about 6 inches tall off the main stem , carefully cut off all but the top two leaves, plant the tiny branch in a pot, and wait.     Roots will emerge along the stem and new growth will soon appear if kept damp, warm and out of direct sunlight. If you have never rooted stem cuttings before, you will have gained not only a tomato crop but also a skill that you can now apply to other plants in your garden, both edible and ornamental . Tomato  s such as peppers and eggplants can be similarly rooted, as can many herbs, especially those in the mint family.

The Mirrorcube which stands four meters high and four meters wide, and the walls of which are made with a mirrored glass, has drawn widespread attention as it will be attached to a single tree. \"It's an interesting building. You can't find anything else like this in the world today. It's unique ,\" says Lindvall. \"Everything will reflect in it---the trees, the birds, the clouds and the sun in the forest.

She plans to go to college and intends to finish with a master's degree. Her performance is fairly good, but test scores are very low. She has held many leadership and volunteer positions. We have been advised to have her write an essay about how her learning disability is a barrier that she has overcome. Will that help or hurt her chances for admission? --Deborah AFirst let me answer the question on low standardized test scores (ACT/ SAT). There are hundreds of colleges that are \"test optional\" which means students can choose not to release their test scores in the application process. Admission decisions at these colleges for students who do not submit their test scores are made based on other factors. A list of test optional colleges can be found atfairtest.org. It is important, however, to make sure that the college is the right fit academically regardless of the test optional policy. You also asked if your daughter should write about her disability and if this would hurt her chances of being admitted. Please know that colleges do not deny admission based on disability. \"Disclosing\" a learning disability in a personal statement within the college application can certainly help. By writing a personal statement, students can potentially demonstrate, for example, their understanding of the challenge they face. They might also demonstrate an improved grade trend in that subject area, and show interest in more complex courses in spite of this disability. More importantly, a student disclosure can show self-confidence, motivation and an understanding of the disability. --Ms. Kravis What do we know about Deborah's daughter?", "subject": ""}

Well, I'm happy to tell you what I know. When I started school here, it had already been a week since the school opened. At this school, freshmen usually go on a trip for about three days at the beginning of school. Unfortunately I missed that wonderful trip, which would have been the best time to get to know my classmates. I was really sad. I wished I'd known about it earlier. Despite the disappointment, however, I gradually adapted to my new life and school. There is a space in the basement of the teaching building where students chat and meet each other. As we do not always have the same classrooms and classmates, the school wants us to get to know each other there. Students usually come to school early, sit in that space and have fun. Around the space, there are many lockers for students to leave their books in, so that students do not have to carry a heavy schoolbag everywhere. It really surprises me that we have almost no textbooks. We only have textbooks for World History and Algebra 2 and they are big and heavy, like bricks. For other classes, we only need binders   with paper in them. Without textbooks, students learn things freely and actively. For example, my humanities teacher just teaches us what is in her mind at the time. We never know what we will learn. Another difference between American schools and Chinese schools is that American schools care about students' morality more than their academic studies. For example, if you do not finish your homework, you will just be asked to do it later, but if you cheat or lie, you will get a warning or even be kicked out.

While discovering a new destination may seem exciting, keep in a mind a little bit of preparation can make your getaway all the more special. Here are some travel tips that can minimize any unpleasant circumstances that may arise when you are not familiar with the country you are travelling to.  Be familiar with the culture and traditions of your destination. East is East and West is West and never the twain shall meet. Rudyard Kipling's views may not seem entirely true with the world becoming a global village. There are, however, still differences that must be taken into consideration. It is better to be acquainted with the culture and traditions of the country you are visiting. For example, you may be travelling the Bali, a country equally well-known for its beautiful landscapes and temples as it is for its warm people. However, keep in mind that you must be suitably dressed to enter a temple. If you go wearing shorts, you may not be allowed to enter. Keeping into consideration facts such as this can make all the difference to your visit. General information about your destination Weather: This will help you decide what you have to pack for the journey and stay. Currency: No travel trip is complete without shopping and bringing back souvenirs. So it is important to be familiar with the currency, notes and coins and their denominations. Cost of local items: This will help you plan your budget and also give you a rough idea of the costs so that you are not taken for a ride when you go for your shopping expedition. Booking accommodation: Book your accommodation well in advance. This is especially important if you are travelling during the high season and you may find it difficult to get a hotel or guesthouse within your budget. Dealing with language problems: Be familiar with common words and phrases to make going around easier.

Make two copies of your passport. Keep them in separate places, for example, you can leave one copy in your room and keep another with your friend. Should your passport be lost or stolen, you can use the copy to exit the country or use it to facilitate the replacement process. Email yourself all the important information such as credit card numbers, passport numbers, your driving license details etc. and anything else that could be of importance if an emergency arises.

Xinhua, the state news agency, said late on Wednesday that 357 officials are to face punishment, with 192 criminal cases already filed and 202 people detained after improperly stored or transported vaccines were sent to 59 health institutions. This is the latest in a string of food and drug safety scandals in a country where parents often import products for infants and babies from overseas to ensure quality. Many remember with fear the 2008 milk powder scandal, in which infant formula laced with melamine caused at least six deaths and 300,000 children to fall ill. Beijing last month made public an illegal operation in eastern Shandong province in which a hospital pharmacist and her daughter traded $88m in vaccines that may have been compromised because they were expired or improperly stored or transported. The China Food and Drug Administration said, however, that the vaccines posed no greater than the normal risk to patients. \"We don't see that the vaccines' effectiveness has been reduced,\" added the health watchdog in a report. Nonetheless, health officials fear a backlash against Chinese-manufactured vaccines, which already have a reputation for being more dangerous than those made overseas.  Wang Yuedan, deputy director of Peking University's immunology department, said the key to evaluating risks is to check whether package seals are broken or for pollution with micro-organisms. \"The vaccines in the Shandong case don't have those problems,\" he said. Those vaccines had been subject to higher than normal temperatures that could have lowered their effectiveness and reduced their protective value.

But some slimmers take a slightly different approach -- consuming more than half their weekly calorie intake from Friday night to Sunday. Away from the daily routine at work that helps them keep control of what they eat, they are snacking and drinking their way to a shocking 10,000 calories, a survey has found. Almost three-quarters of people trying to lose weight admit to over-eating at the weekend. A meal with friends or family, complete with alcohol, as well as a late-night snack before bed, can lead to adults consuming up to 3,500 calories in one day, a survey found. Men typically need 2,500 calories a day and women 2,000 calories. Consuming this amount would see men and women get through half their weekly calorie intake over the course of a 'bad' weekend. Women were found to eat less on a Sunday because of guilt over their consumption over the previous two days. Men had fewer doubts about a third day of excess. The biggest weekend diet danger comes from snacking between meals, the survey found. Some say they will often spend Saturday night in front of the TV with their families -- combining watching their favorite shows with crisps and biscuits. And seven in ten people admitted to having fattening takeaways at weekends, with pizza the most popular. Alcohol is another big factor in weekend bingeing.Around 70 percent still like to have a roast on a Sunday or a big meal with family or friends and a third of those will have second helpings. A spokesman from Forza Supplements, the diet company that conducted the survey, said, \"We all have bad weekends where we have a lot of fun, but dieting goes out of the window.\" The 5:2 diet is becoming increasingly popular -- where we limit our calories for five days and allow ourselves a few treats on the other two days. \"For many people, the two days off are Saturday and Sunday but they go way too far\" Which kind of weekend diet does the greatest harm?", "subject": ""}

{"answer": 3, "choices": ["share her sad feelings with strangers", "tell strangers how outstanding she was", "express her wish to have a bright day", "brighten strangers' day with kind words"], "question": "When 24-year-old Hannah Brencher moved to New York after college, she was hit by depression and loneliness. One day she felt so lonely that she wanted to reach out to someone. So she put pen to paper and started writing letters--letters to complete strangers. But these weren't sad letters about how she was feeling. They were happy letters, all about the other person, not her. She would write messages for people to have a \"bright day\" and tell strangers how outstanding they were, even if they thought no one else had noticed. Brencher began dropping the notes all over New York, in cafes, in library books, in parks and on the subway. It made her feel better, knowing that she might be making somebody's day through just a few short, sweet words. It gave her something to focus on. And so, the website The World Needs More Love Letters was born. The World Needs More Love Letters is all about writing letters--not emails, but proper, handwritten letters. Not traditional love letters, written to a real beloved, but surprise letters for strangers.

Find me when you can.'\" And then comes another story of a man threatening to kill himself on his Facebook page, only to now be in the land of the living, with many love letters under his pillow.

At the various times when I have helped you a little, you have said to me, \"We can get along very well again,\" but in a very short time I find you in the same difficulty again. Now this can only happen by some fault in your behavior. What that fault is, I think I know. You are not lazy, and still you are an idler . I doubt whether since I saw you, you have done a good whole day's work, in any other day. You do not very much dislike to work, and still you do not work much, merely because it does not seem to you that you could get much for it. This habit of uselessly wasting time is the whole difficulty; it is vastly important to you, and still more so to your children, that you should break this habit. It is more important to them, because they have longer to live, and can keep out of an idle habit before they are in it, easier than they can get out after they are in. You are now in need of some ready money; and what I suggest is, that you shall go to work hard, for somebody who will give you money for it. Let father and your boys take charge of your things at home-prepare for a crop, and make the crop, and you go to work for the best money wages, or to pay back any debt you owe. And to secure you a fair reward for your labor, I now promise you that for every dollar you will, between this and the first of May, get for your own labor, I will then give you one other dollar. By this, if you hire yourself at ten dollars a month, from me you will get ten more, making twenty dollars a month for your work. Now if you will do this, you will soon be out of debt, and what is better, you will have a habit that will keep you from getting in debt again. But if I should now clear you out, next year you will be just as deep in as ever. You say you would almost give your place in Heaven for $ 70 or $80.

At the various times when I have helped you a little, you have said to me, \"We can get along very well again,\" but in a very short time I find you in the same difficulty again. Now this can only happen by some fault in your behavior. What that fault is, I think I know. You are not lazy, and still you are an idler . I doubt whether since I saw you, you have done a good whole day's work, in any other day. You do not very much dislike to work, and still you do not work much, merely because it does not seem to you that you could get much for it. This habit of uselessly wasting time is the whole difficulty; it is vastly important to you, and still more so to your children, that you should break this habit. It is more important to them, because they have longer to live, and can keep out of an idle habit before they are in it, easier than they can get out after they are in. You are now in need of some ready money; and what I suggest is, that you shall go to work hard, for somebody who will give you money for it. Let father and your boys take charge of your things at home-prepare for a crop, and make the crop, and you go to work for the best money wages, or to pay back any debt you owe. And to secure you a fair reward for your labor, I now promise you that for every dollar you will, between this and the first of May, get for your own labor, I will then give you one other dollar. By this, if you hire yourself at ten dollars a month, from me you will get ten more, making twenty dollars a month for your work. Now if you will do this, you will soon be out of debt, and what is better, you will have a habit that will keep you from getting in debt again. But if I should now clear you out, next year you will be just as deep in as ever. You say you would almost give your place in Heaven for $ 70 or $80. Then you value your place in Heaven cheaply, for I am sure you can with the offer I make you get the seventy or eighty dollars for four or five months' work. You say if I furnish you the money you will deed  me the land, and if you don't pay the money back, you will deliver possession-Nonsense! If you can't now live with the land, how will you then live without it? You have always been kind to me, and I do not now mean to be unkind to you.

Many people just cannot resist bargains. Provided they think they are getting a bargain they will buy clothes they will never wear or furniture they have no space for.

I tried to keep silent at my new job, avoiding the other employees. All of them didn't care about me except for one girl. She kept at me, telling me stories of her weekend and how she loved snowboarding, something I was interested in as well. She was the type of warm personality where people were immediately drawn to her, and soon enough I found myself looking forward to our coffee breaks and snowboarding after work. The more I hung out with her, the more I realized that this girl, who seemed to have it all together, was in fact just like me, except for one major difference. She laughed at herself. One night after work we were snowboarding and she fell down carelessly resulting in a mouth full of snow. Instead of getting embarrassed she jumped right up laughing loudly at how ridiculous she must have looked. As time went on, her warm personality began to wear off  on me and soon enough I had a mini-breakthrough. I'm not saying that I no longer find myself in embarrassing situations; I've just learned how to handle them differently. Just a few months ago I walked out of a bathroom unaware of the fact that my skirt was tucked  in my underwear. But instead of rushing back to the bathroom I calmly pulled it out and continued on my way shaking my head and smiling. What's the writer's purpose of writing this passage?", "subject": ""}

One summer I build a model car with my father. It was a simple affair, and as a capable 12-year-old, I could have easily done it alone.

{"answer": 0, "choices": ["turn to others", "work even harder", "feel more frustrated", "learn from upper-class people"], "question": "That Upper class people generally have more educational opportunities, greater financial security, and better jobs than people from lower social classes, but that doesn't mean they're more skilled at everything. A new study finds, surprisingly, that lower class people are better at reading the emotions of others. The researchers were inspired by observing that, for lower class people, success depends more on how much they can rely on other individuals. For example, if you can't afford to  buy support services, you have to rely on your neighbors or relatives to watch the kids while you're busy. One experiment researched on volunteers who worked at a university: some had graduated from college and others had not. Researchers used the educational level as an indicator for social classes. The volunteers did a test of emotion perception , in which they were instructed to look at pictures of faces and indicate which emotions each face was displaying. People with more education performed worse on the task than people with less education.

It is impolite to be late. Also, it bothers other students. If you must come in late, be sure to do it quietly. Have your books and papers out of your bag before you come into the room. Then go to your seat and sit down quietly. In the USA, it is not necessary to knock before you enter the classroom. Most teachers will give you a low grade if you are often late. In America, you should call your teacher by his or her last name instead of \" teacher\". Also you should use Mr, Miss, Ms or Mrs before the last name ( such as Mrs Smith or Mr Jones). This is polite. The teacher will tell you the title that he or she likes. It is impolite in the USA to eat, drink or chew gum during class. Don't do these until the break. Also, removing your shoes in the classroom is not polite. Which of the following is NOT true according to the passage?", "subject": ""}

At work I am always being flooded with questions from coworkers, suppliers, telephone and then those dread meetings, so the last thing I need is some stranger to sit beside me and make small talk.                I don't know why but for some reason when I got on the train today it was unusually full, something I don't recall ever happening in the past. With hesitation I sat down in the only seat available beside a middle-aged man that had his head down and seemed to be lost in his thoughts. I was glad that he didn't notice when I sat next to him as he just continued to look down towards the floor.                 Shortly after the train left for my 30-minute ride downtown I found myself wondering what this man was thinking about. What could be so important that he didn't even see me sit next to him? I tried to forget about it and started to read my paper. However, for some strange reason this \"inner voice\" kept urging me to talk to this man. I tried to ignore the \"voice\" as there was no way I was starting a conversation with a complete stranger. www.ks5u.com                 As you probably guessed I eventually broke down and came up with an excuse to ask him a question. When he raised his head and turned his eyes towards me I could see that he must have been really upset as he had red eyes and still had some tears rolling down the side of his face despite his weak attempt to wipe them away. I can't describe the sadness I felt seeing someone in so much pain.                 We talked for about 20 minutes and in the end he seemed to be doing better. As we were leaving the train he thanked me again and again for being an angel by taking the time to talk. I never did find out what was making his heart so heavy with pain but was glad I listened to the \"voice\" that day.                 Several weeks had passed when I noticed an envelope on my desk after returning from lunch. It was not addressed to anyone and only had the word \"Angel\" written on it. My receptionist attached a note saying a gentleman dropped it off saying he did not know my name but had described me well enough that the receptionist knew it was for me.                 When I read the note inside the envelope I was so filled with emotions that I couldn't contain myself. It was a letter from the man I met on the train thanking me again for talking to him and saving his life that day. Apparently he had some very hurtful personal problems that were so challenging that he was planning to take his life that day. In his letter he went on to explain that he was a religious person and in desperation screamed out to God that if God really cared about him he would send someone to prevent him from taking his life.

The study also says that more than 100,000 bloggers stopped taking part in the activity after a year. However, some people develop serious blogs to present political and other ideas.

Blue is a slang way of saying unhappy. Mondays are generally seen as the worst day of the week because people feel grumpy  and tired at having to go back to work after a weekend with a different sleep pattern. There are various reasons why more people feel depressed at this time of year. Many people have unpaid credit card bills for the Christmas presents they bought, and pay day is often not until the end of the month. As the party season is over, people feel stressed because they have to go back to real life - work and commuting; and they may be unhappy with their body image after bingeing on booze, chocolates, and other food at Christmas-time. People may have already failed in their New Year's resolutions, such as giving up smoking. The bad weather in January can also contribute to people feeling fed up. Some companies are taking this quite seriously and offering counselling   for any staff who are feeling depressed. They hope that helping people as soon as there are signs of depression will avoid absenteeism . Evidence shows that unreasonable managers who contribute to their staff feeling fed up at this time can expect an uncooperative workforce. However, it's not all bad! Many people feel optimistic at this time, that things can only get better. Psychologists offer suggestions of how to combat feeling blue. These include spending 15 minutes doing a 'gratitude exercise' thinking about and writing down what you are grateful for, such as health, family, friends and so on. Taking up a new hobby, doing some exercise, going to bed earlier, eating a healthy breakfast, and listening to some uplifting music, are all recommended as ways to feel more cheerful.

Then, by the time the following spring came, the pain was almost bearable and again I could find pleasure in the miraculous reward of nature. At first, I went to the cemetery with trepidation. But then, amazingly, by tending her grave and decorating it with flowers, I was ridding myself of the painful memories. The years passed. I moved from Kaposvar, Hungary, the town where I had been born and had spent my youth. So did my siblings. We only came together on feast days, especially on All Souls' Day in the cemetery. Father lived with me for many years, to a ripe old age. Now that he, too, rests beneath the white marble stone, I go even more eagerly to the cemetery. While I tend my parents' grave site, again I am with them in thought. One day I noticed a modest grave site behind my parents' plot. It lay among the magnificent granite and marble markers of the other graves, its very simplicity _ . Ivy  had covered the site and its only decoration was a simple wooden cross on which was written in copper letters a name, and that she lived 22 years. Whenever I went by, the plot and its surroundings looked cared for and neat, and each time I felt curious about this mysterious woman who had lived all of 22 years. Once I saw an elderly man leaving from there. I concluded that perhaps he had come to visit his wife. In 1996 I was preparing for All Souls' Day in the cemetery when again I caught sight of him, tending the grave. Tall, somewhat bent, he was well passed middle age. We nodded to each other and continued our work. Occasionally I stole a glance at my neighbor. When I noticed that he hadn't got the tools for a proper cleanup, I offered him mine, which he gratefully accepted. After this, it seemed only natural to engage him in conversation. I asked him whose grave it was. This was his answer: \"My mother's. She died young, in 1912 when I was only a year-and-a half old. I really never knew her. I made her that cross and the copper letters.\" Then he went on:\"No one comes to visit this grave but me because I was her only child. She died of pneumonia. My father remarried and my stepmother only cared for her own children. So then I always came here to my mother, whether in sadness or in joy. Later, life took me far afield, but I never forgot this grave. For me it was the same as the family home is for others. I always came home here.\" \"With the years passing, it is getting more difficult for me to come, but as long as my legs will carry me, at least twice a year I visit my mother. I'm in my 80s. so who knows how long I can still make it.\" In stunned silence I listened. Tears clouded my eyes as I realized that I had never seen such boundless love. How much easier is my lot, I thought, for at any moment I can reach into my storehouse of memories and draw out the joyful or sad vignettes  that bind me to my parents with a thousand threads. What memories might this kindly old gentleman harbor? Perhaps a face from an ancient faded photograph of his mother. What a great attachment throughout his long life must have led him back again and again to the resting place of that young woman whose motherly love he could never truly savor , only forever feels its enormous lack. We said good-bye. I was deeply moved because I knew that I had been given a great gift. I had been allowed a glimpse of the royal and long-lasting affection that bound a simple and noble-hearted man to his mother. I decided I would tend the grave together with that of my parents, where, finally, the aged child will have met his youthful mother. What message is conveyed in the passage?", "subject": ""}

The Arabian Nights, came wrapped in red paper. I was just ready to read when my mother walked into my room. \"Isn't your doll just beautiful?\" my mother asked. I looked at the doll, with fair hair in a pink dress----I'll have to call her \"she\" because I never gave her a name. I folded my lips and raised my eyebrows, not really knowing how to let my mother down easily. \"This doll is different.\" My mother explained, trying to talk me into playing with it. Thinking the doll needed love, I hugged her tightly for a long time. Useless, I said to myself. Finally, I decided to play with the doll's house. But since rearranging the tiny furniture seemed to be the only active possible, I lost interest. I caught sight again of the third of my gifts The Arabian Nights, and I began to read it. From that moment, the book was my constant companion. Every day I climbed our garden tree, nestled among its branches, I read the stories in The Arabian Nights to my heart's content. My mother became concerned as she noticed I wasn't playing with either the doll or the little house. She insisted that I take the doll up the tree with me. Trying to read on a branch 15 feet off the ground while holding on to the silly doll was not easy. After nearly falling off twice, I tied one end of a long vine around the doll's neck and the opposite one around the branch, letting the doll hang in mid air while I read. I always looked out for my mother, though. I sensed that my playing with the doll was of great importance to her. So every time I heard her coming, I lifted the doll up and hugged her. The smile in my mother's eyes told me my plan worked. The inevitable  happened one afternoon. Totally absorbed in the reading, I didn't hear my mother calling me. When I looked down, I saw my mother staring at the hanging doll. Fearing the worst of scolding, I climbed down in a flash, reaching the ground just as my mother was untying the doll. To my surprise, she didn't scold. She kept on staring at the doll. The next day, my father came home early and suggested he and I play with the doll's house. Soon I was bored, but my father seemed to be having so much fun, I didn't have the heart to tell him. Quietly I slipped out, picking up my book on my way to the yard. So absorbed was he in arranging and rearranging the tiny furniture that he didn't notice my quick exit. Almost 20 years passed before I found out why the hanging-doll incident had been so significant for my parents. By then I was a parent myself. After recalling the incident, my mother said all those years she had been afraid whether I would turn out to be a most loving and understanding mother to my son.

Now it has grown to include almost l,500 sites across the U. S., with thousands of children attending the program each year.      \"Our main purpose is to help children develop a greater interest in the fields of STEM,\" said Lori Bryne, the Senior Regional Program Manager. Children in the camp will be given the opportunity to explore the unknown and put ideas into practice.      The program will challenge children to real world situations that will help them build a team spirit and life skills.      The program will include five modules this year.      One module will feature \"Problem Solving on Planet ZAK\". It will challenge children by creating a world of science fiction.

He was famous because of the books he wrote for children. They combine funny words, pictures, and social opinions. Dr Seuss wrote his first book for children in 1937. It is called And to Think That I Saw It on Mulberry Street. A number of publishers refused to publish it. They said it was too different. A friend finally published it. Soon other successful books followed. Over the years, he wrote more than forty children's books. They were fun to read. Yet his books sometimes dealt with serious subjects. By the middle 1940s, Dr Seuss had become one of the best-loved and most successful writers of children's books. He liked helping children. In 1954, Life magazine published a report about school children who could not read. The report said that many children's books weren't interesting. Dr Seuss decided to write books that were interesting and easy to read. In 1957, Dr Seuss wrote The Cat in the Hat. He used less than 225 words to write the book.

From a housekeeper's daughter to a successful business woman, her life has all the marks of a Hollywood blockbuster. Madam Tussaud was born in 1761 and named Marie Grosholtz. Her father was killed in battle only two months before Mane's birth. For the first five years of her life, Marie lived in Berne with her mother, who worked as housekeeper for Dr Philippe Curtius. A doctor, with a talent for wax modeling, Curtius became her teacher. It was Curtius who opened the original wax exhibition in Paris in 1770 and introduced Marie to some famous people. At only 17, she modeled the famous writer Francois Voltaire, followed by a portrait of American statesman Benjamin Franklin when he was in Paris as US ambassador. Both figures are still on display at Madame Tussaud's, London today. Her work at Curtius successful wax exhibition led to an invitation to the court of Louis XVI and his queen.

Amy Chua is a Yale Law School professor and the mother of two teenage girls. She is the daughter of Chinese immigrants. In the Chinese culture, the tighter represents strength and power. In her book, Ms. Chua writes about how she demanded excellence from her daughters. Chua writes that her daughters, Sophia and Louisa, were never allowed to go on a date, be in a school play, watch TV or play computer games. They couldn't choose their own after-class activities or get any grade less than an A. They had to play piano or violin - and no other musical instruments.     She writes that if a Chinese child gets a B - which she says \"would never happen\" - there would be \"a screaming, hair-tearing explosion.\" She describes making her 7-year-old daughter play a piano piece perfectly - yelling and not letting her leave the bench even to use the bathroom - until it was. Many people have criticized Amy Chua. Some say her parenting methods were abusive. She even admits that her husband, who is not Chinese, objected to her parenting style. But she says that was the way her parents raised her and her three sisters. Stacy Debroff, who has written four books on parenting, says Amy Chua's parenting style is not limited to Chinese families. She says it represents a traditional way of parenting among immigrants seeking a better future for their children. But she also sees a risk. When children have no time to be social or to follow their own interests, they might not develop other skills that they need to succeed in life. Stacy Debroff advises parents not to just repeat the way they were raised. Alison Lo, an assistant professor of marketing at the University of Washington's Bothell campus, said. \"I don't think Amy is advocating a best practice of parenting style, or that success and achievements are critical yardsticks of a good life.

There are three different learning types: Visual, Auditory, and Kinesthetic. You can be a _ of learning types, but most people have one main type. 1. Visual learners learn best by seeing. If you seem to easily get information from pictures, graphs, and videos, you are likely a visual learner. 2. Auditory learners learn best by hearing. If you seem to remember things by hearing them, whether listening to a lecture or repeating information out loud, then you are likely an auditory learner. 3. Kinesthetic learners learn best by doing. If you seem to learn best by working with your hands or testing out what you are shown, you are likely a kinesthetic learner.

{"answer": 3, "choices": ["They don't think it is polite behavior.", "They have sales every January.", "They can always get a better price somewhere else.", "They dislike openly expressing feelings or opinions."], "question": "In the UK, we like a good bargain. People flock to the sales in January, when stores slash their prices to get rid of all their winter stock. But surprisingly, the British hate _ In markets you might see the odd British person battling with a stall owner to bring down the price of a pair of trousers or some furniture. Generally, though, people from the UK are too reserved to haggle. If we think the price of something we want is too high, we'll simply move on and try somewhere else. The act of bargaining with someone is very theatrical, in my opinion. It's a test to see who can stand their ground for the longest. But it is not in British people's nature to \"perform\" in public, especially around strangers. However, in the US, people are generally more willing to haggle. And if you wander into a market, you're likely to hear a number of phrases that Americans reserve for such occasions. First, \" _ \" is commonly said by the customer to indicate they think the stall holder is working very hard, probably a little too hard, to get the price he wants. Or you might hear the buyer telling a stall holder that \"the kid's gotta have braces\", which means they don't have enough spare money lying around to afford the price being offered.

The team calculates the Car-puccino will do three miles per kilo of ground coffee   -- about 56 cups of espressos   per mile.The journey will use about 70 kilos of ground coffee which, at supermarket prices of between PS13 and PS26 a kilo depending on brand and quality, will cost between PS910 and PS1,820, or between 25 and 50 times the PS36 cost of petrol for the journey.In total, the trip will cost 11,760 espressos, and the team will have to take 'coffee breaks' roughly every 30 to 45 miles to pour in more granules.They will also have to stop about every 60 miles to clean out the 'coffee filters' to rid them of the soot and tar which is also generated by the process.So despite a top speed of 60mph, the many stops mean the going will be slow, with the journey taking around ten hours.

More than 300 people gathered to enjoy a bowl of porridge made from genetically modified food on Saturday, an attempt to quell public fears about the safety of the product. The first China Golden Rice Tasting Event was held at Huazhong Agricultural University in Wuhan, Hubei province, sparking another round in the nationwide debate about the safety of GM crops, often called \"Frankenfood\" by opponents. Similar events have been held in more than 28 cities since May, the university said. Both the pro and anti camps have posted conflicting comments on the Internet, with each providing evidence to back up their beliefs, but the exchanges are becoming increasingly bitter. Jiang Tao, a senior engineer at the Center for Agricultural Resources Research at the Chinese Academy of Sciences, who is in favor of GM foods, was annoyed about what he called \"amateurs\" spreading rumors. \"Just look at the people who are opposed to GM foods; can you find anyone from a related field in the scientific community?\" he asked. Jiang also accused the anti-GM lobby of repeatedly using outdated or inaccurate data to support an \"incorrect\" stance. Chen Yunfa, an independent researcher into the Yangtze River Delta economy, recently wrote a commentary on the Internet news portal Eastday in which he criticized the actions of the 61 scientists, saying they had gone \"beyond their proper duty\". He suggested that large multinational corporations might be behind the letter and similar incidents, prompted by a desire to freeze China's patent hybrid rice technology out of the market. To support his contentions, Chen said that GM rice, first produced by scientists in the US, still hasn't gained official approval from the US government. However, the US authorities have actually granted licenses to six varieties of GM rice. The commercial planting of two varieties - anti-herbicide (BAR) transgenic rice LL RICE 06 and LL RICE 62 - produced by the French pharmaceutical company Sanofi-Aventis, was approved in 1999 and a license for cultivation for edible use was granted in 2000. The public outcry for GM labeling and boycotting has hindered the advancement of the technology. Concern about GM foods has been fueled by studies like the one published by French professor Gilles-Eric Seralini in September 2012. Seralini claimed that his research involving rats proved that the GM corn fed to them caused tumor growth. Furthermore, there is growing concern that the pesticides  used on GMOs are contributing to the decline of the world's honey bee population, leading to honey bee deaths by infecting the brains of the insects with toxins. Therefore, some experts recommend the labeling of non-GM foods so that consumers can make that decision without a regulatory burden being placed on GMOs.

As we began to be more used to one another, Miss Havisham talked more to me, and asked me such questions as what had I learnt and what was I going to be? I told her I was going to be apprenticed  to Joe, my sister's husband; then I explained my knowing nothing and wanting to know everything, in the hope that she might offer some help. But, she did not; on the contrary, she seemed to prefer my being ignorant. Neither did she ever give me any money - or anything but my daily dinner - nor even mentioned that I should be paid for my services. Estella was always about, and always let me in and out, but never told me I might kiss her again. Sometimes, she would coldly tolerate me; sometimes, she would be seemingly kind to me; sometimes, she would be quite familiar with me; sometimes, she would tell me energetically that she hated me. Miss Havisham would often ask me in a whisper, or when we were alone, \"Does she grow prettier and prettier, Pip?\" And when I said yes, Miss Havisham would seem to enjoy it greedily. Also, when we played at cards Miss Havisham would look on Estella's moods, whatever they were. And sometimes, when her moods were so many and so contradictory of one another that I was puzzled what to say or do, Miss Havisham would hold her tightly with great fondness, saying something quietly in her ear that sounded like \"Break their hearts my pride and hope, break their hearts and have no mercy!\" Miss Havisham held Estella tightly because   _  .", "subject": ""}

The chips send back name, job, hobbies, and the time available for meeting-whatever. Making new friends becomes simple. This hasn't quite happened in real life. But the world is already experiencing a revolution using RFID technology. An RFID tag with a tiny chip can be fixed in a product, under your pet's skin, even under your own skin.

{"answer": 3, "choices": ["Seasonal winds", "Warmer wet air", "Mild weather", "Heavy snowfalls"], "question": "The effect of the Great Lakes on weather in the region is called the lake effect. In winter*the lakes often have no ice in the middle. The seasonal winds from the west pick up the slightly warmer wet air from the lake surface. As the slightly warmer wet air passes over the colder land surface, it often produces heavy snowfall. This is similar to the effect of warmer air passing over mountain ranges, which often leads to dropping snow. During the period of freezing weather, the \"snow belt\",caused by the seasonal winds, receives regular snow fall and this phenomenon along the eastern shore forms the localized weather pattern, especially in Michigan, Ohio and so on. The lakes also  _ seasonal temperatures to some degree, by absorbing heat to cool the air in summer and then slowly giving out that heat in autumn. This function of the lakes protects the autumn against frost, and it also keeps the summer time temperatures cooler than further inland. This temperature buffering produces areas known as \"fruit belts\",where fruits typically grown farther south can be produced. That is why some southern fruits like apples ,cherries and grapes can be found in western Michigan near the lake shore as far north as the Grand Traverse Bay. The eastern shore of Lake Michigan and the southern shore of Lake Erie have many wine makers as a result of this. However ,the lake effect has been found to be related to the occurrence of bad weather. For example, fogs are often formed over medium-sized areas along the shorelines of the lakes. This is most noticeable along Lake Superior's shores ,due to its coastal climate. A case in point is Hurricane Hazel in 1954,and tornadoes in Michigan and Ontario in 2007. Such evidence shows that the lake effect may help strengthen storms. What result does \"the lake effect\" bring to the eastern shore?   _  .", "subject": ""}

Researchers have developed a book with specially treated pages that can turn dirty water into clean and drinkable water. They say their invention could improve the lives of many in the developing world. About 700 million people around the world are at risk of disease or even death because their drinking water is not clean. The water is polluted by harmful bacteria. The book contains 25 pages. Each page is about one millimeter thick. The pages contain very small particles   of silver. The pages can be used as filters to remove harmful microorganisms   that can pollute drinking water. The filter kills the organisms that pass through it. Pictures on the pages show the dangers of dirty water and how to use the book for those unable to read. The pages are made of filter paper.

{"answer": 0, "choices": ["High fuel prices' influences on school buses.", "New measures to transport school students.", "The safest form of student transportation.", "The origin of Walk to School Day."], "question": "The united States has about 475,000 school buses -- all painted yellow. Each day they carry more than 25,000,000 children, half of all schoolchildren in the country. But these buses, on average, use four liters of diesel   fuel to travel less than sixteen kilometers. When the school year began last fall, diesel averaged 55 cents a liter nationally. The price nearly doubled, to a dollar and 8 cents, by the end of school in June. Bob Riley speaks for the American School Bus Council. He says fuel prices for schools are not much lower than others have to pay. As a result, schools are looking for ways to reduce transportation costs. Bus routes are being redrawn or, in some cases, canceled. Some areas are buying buses that use natural gas or other alternative fuels. Other steps include fewer field trips and less travel by sports teams. And some school districts may end any bus service not required by law. Studies show that school buses are the safest form of transportation to and from school. The American School Bus Council says cuts in bus service are bad for children and possibly the environment. It says removing buses from the road will mean an increase in other vehicles transporting students. Spokesman Bob Riley says another concern is that reducing bus services might reduce attendance. But it could also get more children to walk or bicycle to school. And that would surely make people happy at the National Center for Safe Routes to School.

Although they may be wealthier than some of the old rich,the new rich are anxious to make their money like everybody else lower than their class.Thus their prestige  is generally lower than that of the old rich,who have not found it necessary to lift a finger to make their money,and who tend to look down upon the new rich.

They share a number of similarities with each other -- as well as some important differences. Manned submersibles  , like spaceships, must maintain living conditions in an unnatural environment. While a spaceship must simply be sealed against the vacuum space, a submersible must be able to bear extreme pressure if it is not to break up in deep water. In exploring space, unmanned vehicles were employed before astronauts. In undersea exploration, on the other hand, men paved the way, and only recently have unmanned remote-operated vehicles (ROVs) been put to use. One reason for this is that communicating with vehicles in orbit is much easier than talking to those underwater. A vacuum is an ideal medium for radio communications, but underwater communications are limited to much slower sound waves. Thus, most undersea vehicles -- particularly ROVs -- operate at the end of long ropes.  For a similar reason, knowing where you are undersea is much more difficult than in space. A spaceship's position can be located by following its radio signal, or by using telescopes and radar. For an undersea vehicle, however, a special network of sonar  devices must be laid out in advance on the ocean floor in the area of a dive to locate the vehicle's position.

{"answer": 2, "choices": ["Positive responses.", "Work attitudes.", "Higher-order growth needs.", "Personal self-direction."], "question": "Does everyone want a challenging job? In spite of all the attention focused by the media, academicians, and social scientists on human potential and the needs of individuals, there is no evidence to support that the vast majority of workers want challenging jobs. Some individuals prefer highly complex and challenging jobs; others develop in simple, routine work. The individual-difference variable that seems to gain the greatest support for explaining who prefers a challenging job and who doesn't is the strength of an individual's needs for personal growth and self-direction at work. Individuals with these higher-order growth needs are more responsive for challenging work. What percentage of ordinary workers actually desire higher-order need satisfactions and will respond positively to challenging jobs? No current data is available, but a study from the 1970s estimated the figure at about 15%. Even after adjusting for changing work attitudes and the growth in white-collar jobs, it seems unlikely that the number today exceeds 40%. The strongest voice advocating challenging jobs has not been workers--it's been professors, social science researchers, and media people. Professors, researchers, and journalists undoubtedly made their career choices, to some degree, because they wanted jobs that gave them autonomy, recognition and challenge. That, of course, is their choice. But for them, to force their needs onto the workforce in general is presumptuous  . Not every employee is looking for a challenging job. Many workers meet their higher-order need off the job. There are 168 hours in every individual's week. Work rarely consumes more than 30% of this time. That leaves considerable opportunities, even for individuals with strong growth needs, to find higher-order need satisfaction outside the workplace. So don't feel you have a responsibility to create challenging jobs for all your employees. For many people, work is something that will never excite or challenge them. And they don't expect to find their growth opportunities at work. Work is merely something they have to do to pay their bills. They can find challenges outside of work on the golf course, fishing, at their local pub, with their friends in social clubs, with their family, and the like.

In spite of all the attention focused by the media, academicians, and social scientists on human potential and the needs of individuals, there is no evidence to support that the vast majority of workers want challenging jobs. Some individuals prefer highly complex and challenging jobs; others develop in simple, routine work. The individual-difference variable that seems to gain the greatest support for explaining who prefers a challenging job and who doesn't is the strength of an individual's needs for personal growth and self-direction at work. Individuals with these higher-order growth needs are more responsive for challenging work. What percentage of ordinary workers actually desire higher-order need satisfactions and will respond positively to challenging jobs? No current data is available, but a study from the 1970s estimated the figure at about 15%. Even after adjusting for changing work attitudes and the growth in white-collar jobs, it seems unlikely that the number today exceeds 40%. The strongest voice advocating challenging jobs has not been workers--it's been professors, social science researchers, and media people. Professors, researchers, and journalists undoubtedly made their career choices, to some degree, because they wanted jobs that gave them autonomy, recognition and challenge. That, of course, is their choice. But for them, to force their needs onto the workforce in general is presumptuous  . Not every employee is looking for a challenging job. Many workers meet their higher-order need off the job. There are 168 hours in every individual's week. Work rarely consumes more than 30% of this time. That leaves considerable opportunities, even for individuals with strong growth needs, to find higher-order need satisfaction outside the workplace. So don't feel you have a responsibility to create challenging jobs for all your employees. For many people, work is something that will never excite or challenge them. And they don't expect to find their growth opportunities at work. Work is merely something they have to do to pay their bills. They can find challenges outside of work on the golf course, fishing, at their local pub, with their friends in social clubs, with their family, and the like.
