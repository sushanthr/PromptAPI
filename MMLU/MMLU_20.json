{"answer": 3, "choices": ["Culture, the origin of racial superiority", "Culture, a faithful mirror of history", "Culture, the vigour of world development", "Culture, a distinctive identity of a nation"], "question": "The term culture now is more used to describe everything from the fine arts to the outlook of a business group or a sports team. In its original sense, however, culture includes all identifying aspects of a racial group, nation, or empire: its physical environment, history, and traditions, its social rules and economic structure, and its religious beliefs and arts. The central beliefs and customs of a group are handed down from one generation to another. It is for this reason that most people regard culture as learned rather than innate. People acquire a culture because they are not born with one. The process by which a person develops a taste for regional foods, accented speech, or an outlook on the world over time, therefore, is known as enculturation  . Cultures are often identified by their symbols -- images that are familiar and coated with meaning. Totem poles   carved with animals and creative figures suggest aspects of the Native American peoples of the Pacific Northwest but more literally represent specific tribes. In Asia and India, the color1 of yellow is connected with temples while in ancient China it was a color1 only the emperor's family was allowed to wear. Thus, different cultures may respond to a symbol quite differently. For example, to some a flag may represent pride, historical accomplishments, or ideals; to others, however, it can mean danger or oppression.  To individuals unfamiliar with cultures outside their own, the beliefs, behaviors, and artistic expression of other groups can seem strange and even threatening. A society that ranks all other cultures against its own standards is considered to be ethnocentric (from the Greek ethnos, meaning \"people,\" and kentros, meaning \"center\"). A strongly ethnocentric society assumes also that what is different from its own culture is likely to be inferior and, possibly, wrong or evil.  All people are ethnocentric to some degree, and some aspects of ethnocentrism, such as national pride, contribute to a well-functioning society. An appreciation for one's own culture, however, does not prevent acceptance and respect for another culture. History documents the long-term vigor and success of multicultural groups in which people from numerous and various cultural backgrounds live and work together. Extreme ethnocentrism, in contrast, can lead to racism -- the belief that it is race and racial origin that account for variations in human character or ability and that one's own race is superior to all others.

The need for friends continued as we grew into our teens. Friends played a big part in the development of our personalities. As adults, it is still important for us to have friends. True friends are people who like us though we make mistakes and who listen to us and tell us the truth. Friends support our decisions and tell us when we're wrong. They laugh with us and share our sadness. They are our partners and share interests with us. They _ us when we are feeling down. They are people with whom we aren't afraid of sharing our secret wishes or what is really on our minds. Friends, you fell safe and warm. At times, they also help with our everyday life, cooking a meal, helping with chores, or giving us a lift when we need. Friends also are there to offer advice, an ear to listen, or a shoulder to cry on.. Friends also help us reduce stress. They not only listen to us when we fell stressed, but also discuss with us how to friends help us forget about problems at work or at home. For a short time, we can lose ourselves in a pleasant activity and perhaps laugh and breathe more easily. What is the best title for the passage?", "subject": ""}

Similar to natural leaves, it can split water into hydrogen and oxygen when put into a bucket of water. The hydrogen and oxygen gases are then stored in a fuel cell, which uses those two materials to produce electricity, located either on top of a house or beside the house.

As a theoretical chemist, Hoffmann studied energy levels in chemical bonds during chemical reactions. He put computers to use to solve his problems and, despite the complexity of his research, was able to explain his theories and discoveries to the non-specialist. For his work he was awarded the 1981 Nobel Prize in chemistry, which he shared with Fukui Kenichi. Born in Poland, Hoffmann settled in New York City as a child and became a United States citizen. He received his undergraduate degree in premedical studies from Columbia College in 1958. He attended Harvard University, where he received his PhD. degree in chemical physics in 1962. He joined the faculty of Cornell University in the mid-1960s and remained there throughout his career. Hoffmann and Nobel laureate chemist Robert Burns Woodward developed rules, based on quantum mechanics, to determine how energy levels in atomic electron orbits influence how a chemical reaction takes place. These simple rules, known as the Woodward-Hoffmann rules, allowed chemists to predict reaction results and was quickly accepted and put to use in a wide variety of situations. Hoffmann later turned his research to a variety of problems related to discovering the molecular structure of inorganic and organometallic compounds. Hoffmann is also known for what is called the Isolobal Analogy, which is yet another discovery linking all areas of chemistry.

The argument is often conveniently referred to as nature vs. nurture. Those who support the \"nature\" side of the conflict believe that our personalities and behavior patterns are largely determined by biological and genetic factors.

Taken to an extreme, this theory maintains that our behavior is predetermined to such a great degree that we are almost completely governed by our instincts .

However, some people think it is not a good idea. There are a number of disadvantages in studying abroad. The following paragraphs will explain why students have these views and the advantages of studying abroad will be discussed.   Students studying abroad may suffer from racial discrimination . As they left their home country, they will become part of a minority group in the new country. The majority group may have a sense of superiority and try to bully them. It is common that Americans or the British discriminate against people from other countries since many of them think that white people are better than others.   In addition, the students may lose their own cultures. Since they have moved to a new place, all the thing there - people, lifestyle and the living environment---would be different from those in their own country. As they will have close contact with the local people and culture, they will be influenced by the new culture even without realizing it. It is ironic that a Chinese person speaks better English than Chinese and forgets about Chinese culture after studying abroad for a few years.   On the other hand, studying abroad will widen the view of students. Although they may give up their own culture, they can really learn from others. As students of the modern world , they should not limit their scope to their home country, but get exposed to the world. Studying abroad can help them expand their horizon and learn many things in the host country, as they will meet and make friends with people from all over the world. So, studying abroad is good for them.   Furthermore, students will learn how to be mature and independent. Students, when in their home country, usually rely on their parents. Statistics show that Chinese students usually rely heavily on their parents; they will leave problems alone and ask their parents to solve them. If they are studying abroad, on many occasions they have to learn how to cope with difficulties they meet. As a result, studying abroad benefits them.    Moreover, the education system of the foreign country may be better than the home country's education system. The home country's education system is very limited. Many teachers just spoon-feed their students. They will ask the students to recite a lot of things and then ask them to write them down. This choice of subjects in school, especially in secondary school, is very narrow; the students cannot choose what they want most. But in some schools in Britain and America, students can choose from a wider range of subjects at school. For example, media studies and corporate communications are courses of study in some schools of those two countries.

If they are studying abroad, on many occasions they have to learn how to cope with difficulties they meet. As a result, studying abroad benefits them.    Moreover, the education system of the foreign country may be better than the home country's education system. The home country's education system is very limited. Many teachers just spoon-feed their students. They will ask the students to recite a lot of things and then ask them to write them down. This choice of subjects in school, especially in secondary school, is very narrow; the students cannot choose what they want most. But in some schools in Britain and America, students can choose from a wider range of subjects at school. For example, media studies and corporate communications are courses of study in some schools of those two countries. If students choose to study abroad, they may have the opportunity to learn more things under a better education system.    All in all, studying abroad will change and influence a student in many aspects. Although it is uncertain if the effects will be positive or negative, I believe students should seize the opportunity to study abroad because they will meet many new things and have new experiences in the new country. If they are clever enough, I think they can find a balance between learning about the new culture and holding onto their own one.

He walked out regularly from the inside festivities to check on the gift table, making sure no one doubtful was hanging around it. Ray and Julia went on a 3-week honeymoon to Italy right after the wedding. When they got back, they opened all the gifts and sent out thank-you notes. But there was one problem. A married couple that used to be good friends had obviously given nothing. This surprised Julia, because Walt and Mary said they were excited to be invited. And, they actually seemed to have had a great time at the wedding. Frankly, Ray didn't even care if they hadn't given a gift. He just needed to know whether to send a thank-you note.

But when it comes to learning about high-technology devices, the opposite can often be true. A training program called the 50 Plus Center in the eastern American city of Columbia, Maryland offers free technology classes to adults over 50. The training program also offers many other kinds of lectures from Qigong and Tai Chi to yoga and Latin jam dance. There are a lot of exercise programs including playing cards and physical exercises where many people just relax and spend some time together. Myra Stafford is 73 years old. She signed up for the class to learn how to use her iPad. She is learning quickly with the help of the young and she enjoys learning from them. She says she is more confident today than she was before. Working with young people makes her feel wonderful because they don't make her feel that she is old or dumb. Eleven-year-old Zhion Perekins is a teacher of the technology class. He says some of the older adults know nothing about high-technology devices and they are very anxious, so patience is very important when working with them. He gains more than just social skills from teaching older residents. He has learned a lot on how to communicate with people. He used to be a shy person, but now he has become outgoing. There is a huge growing population over 60. The training program offers an opportunity for the old people to buy products online using high-technology devices.

He has successfully climbed to the top of the highest mountain in Africa, and most importantly, he's changed the attitude of any normal person who watches him compete. The 17-year-old teenager has one leg. He was born that way, but his goal is to show it's not the one thing that defines him. He would also be the first one to tell you that he just wants to prove to others and himself that he's just like other normal ones. When Calabria was young, his parents tried different prostheses to find out which was most comfortable for their son as he tried to keep up with the family, who has a preference for sports. At first, the Calabrias had their middle child in a prosthesis that looked and functioned like a real leg, but soon they decided to choose a different path when they found it wasn't beneficial to his movement. Then the family moved him to arm crutches and from there a new burst of energy was found. Getting others to believe that he could take off on the soccer field took a little bit longer. When the Calabrias moved to Concord, they had a hard time persuading the town soccer team to allow a child like him to compete with able-bodied kids. After months and months of debates and meetings, the family received the answer they were looking for. Since then, witnessing a young man on crutches who competes against those with two legs has become _ in the Concord community. \"At that time I had nothing but discouragement working with the soccer community; however, now I have nothing but admiration for the fact that he's been allowed to play, and people see that he adds value to game,\" his father said. \"I just think it's a great result.\" This passage shows us a boy with one leg   _  .", "subject": ""}
{"answer": 0, "choices": ["5 billion.", "10 billion.", "15 billion.", "200 billion"], "question": "For more than twenty years scientists have been searching for signs of life on other planets. Most of these searches have been done over the radio. The hope is that someone in outer space may be trying to get in touch with us. Scientists also have sent radio and television messages on spaceships traveling through space, on the chance that someone may be receptive to such messages. Scientists are using powerful radio telescopes to listen to signals from about 1, 000 stars, all within 100 light years of earth. In addition, they will scan the entire sky to \"listen\" for radio messages from more distant stars. Using a computer, they will be able to _ more than eight channels at one time. Scientists are looking for any signal they stands out from the background noise. Of the 200 billion stars in the Milky Way galaxy, scientists find that five percent are like our sun. Perhaps half of them have a planet like earth. Such a planet would be a reasonable distance from the star for temperatures to be right for the evolution of life. Based on the inhabitable(that can be lived in)planets in our galaxy, most scientists agree that chances are likely that one or more of these planets support some life. However, many scientists wonder whether intelligent life exists on other planets. Some believe that twenty years of searching without any intelligible messages shows that no one is out there. They say that the evolution of intelligence comparable to ours is unlikely. Other scientists believe that our search hasn't been long enough to rule out the possibility that intelligent life exists in our galaxy. Although our sun family is only about five billion years old, our galaxy is about 20 billion years old.

This electric vehicle is unlike any other currently on the road. It rolls on four wheels, but its body and chassis  weren't built in a factory. Instead, Strati's designers used a technology called 3-D printing. It created those parts of the car in one piece, from the ground up. \"Compared to a typical vehicle on the road, the Strati definitely looks different,\" says Greg Schroeder, a senior research engineer at the Center for Automotive Research in Ann Arbor, Mich. He did not work on the new car. His organization studies trends and changes in the auto industry. It took 44 hours to print the new car at the International Manufacturing Technology Show in Chicago. Over the next few days, the car's designers installed additional parts. These included the car's engine, brakes and tires. Then, early on September 13, Jay Rogers climbed into the car, started its engine and drove the vehicle onto the street. Rogers helped found Local Motors. It's the Arizona-based company behind the Strati. Two weeks later, his team printed a second Strati, and just as fast, at a fair in New York City. Justin Fishkin, a local Motors official, sees the Strati as a window into the future. Today, car buyers are limited in their choice of a vehicle. They can order only what car companies have already designed. But in the future, he says, you may be able to design your own car online and then get it printed to order. Manufacturing experts say 3-D printing has begun to revolutionize how they make things. The technology has been around for decades. But these machines used to be so expensive that only large companies could afford them. In the last few years, though, that has changed. Many of the machines are now inexpensive enough for small companies--or even individuals --to own. Some local libraries make them available to the public. High Schools are beginning to use them in classrooms. Wide access to these printers means people can now design and print a wide variety of new things. The car's printer is a one-of-a-kind device. The technology behind the 3-D printer used in Chicago is an example of additive manufacturing. This process builds solid objects, slice by slice, from the bottom up. (\"Strati\" means layers, in Italian.) A mechanical arm moves a _ from one side to another, back and forth. As it moves, the nozzle deposits a liquid--often melted plastic or metal (but it could be food, concrete or even cells) --that quickly hardens or bonds to become solid or semi-solid. This creates a single, thin layer. Once a layer is complete, the printer starts depositing the next one. \"There's a lot of interest in 3-D printing in the auto industry,\" says Schroeder. Right now, the technology is particularly useful for building models of cars or car parts. To compete with current auto manufacturers, the 3-D printer would have to increase in a hurry, Schroeder says. By contrast, he notes, a Ford F-150 pickup truck rolls off an assembly line at a rate of roughly one per minute. To print as many Stratis would require many more printers. Schroeder says he doesn't see 3-D printing soon taking over for such high-volume manufacturing. But, he adds, \"Who knows what will happen in the long term?\" Scientists at Oak Ridge National Laboratory in Tennessee designed the 3-D printer used in Chicago.

And most of the food provides you \"light\", \"original\" or \"no sugar\" options to choose from. What is the main idea of the article?", "subject": ""}

At this time Roman artists, scientists and writers influenced by Greek ideas were the world's most advanced. They had become skilled observers of the natural world around them, and had become experts in studying animals, plants, the human body or the stars and planets. They wrote down their ideas about what they saw, and based their theories about the world on their observations. During the fourth and fifth centuries the Roman Empire slowly broke down. Many of the Romans' art and sculptures were destroyed and some manuscripts were lost as well. But most importantly, some of the ancient attitudes were lost. A questioning approach to the world was replaced by an unquestioning one. Why did this happen? One reason was to do with the influence of the Christian Church. Through the thousand years following the fall of the Roman Empire, the Church controlled many aspects of life including education and learning. The Church ran all the universities and thought that the aim of a university should be to teach old ideas more clearly, not to introduce new ones. The scholars in the universities were expected to study God and heaven from the Bible and ancient books, rather than the world around them. Take medicine for example. The main textbook for doctors had been written by a Greek doctor called Galen more than a thousand years earlier. But when Roger Bacon, a thirteenth-century priest , said that a new approach to medicine was needed --- doctors should do their own original research instead of reading writers from the past such as Galen-the Church put him in prison.

{"answer": 1, "choices": ["a mother's", "Polly's", "Charlie's", "Tough Big Sister's"], "question": "After 20 years as a full-time wife and mother, I decided to be a school bus driver for I loved kids. After hard practice, by the time school started that year I'd gotten the hang of it. I was happy in my new work. I became a combination of chauffeur, nurse and friend. And if the kids needed it, I'd put on my \"Tough Big Sister\" act. It was a lot like my previous job---being a mom. When I think about my years of bus driving, many things crowded in, but mostly, I remember Charlie. Charlie, eight years old, with blond hair and crystalline gray eyes, began riding my bus in September of my fourth year driving. They all had stories to tell me about their summers. Charlie, though, ignored me. He didn't even answer when I asked his name. From that day on, Charlie was a trial. If a fight broke out I didn't have to turn my head to know who had started it. If someone was throwing spitballs I could guess the culprit's name. If a girl was crying, chances were Charlie had pulled her hair. No matter how I spoke to him, gently or firmly, he wouldn't say a word. He'd just stare at me with those big gray eyes of his. I asked around some, and found out Charlie's father was dead and he didn't live with his mother. He deserves my patience, I thought. So I practiced every bit of patience I could muster. To my cheery \"Good Morning\", he was silent. When I wished him a happy Halloween, he sneered. Many, many times I asked God how I could reach Charlie. \"I'm at my wit's end.\" I'd say. Still I was sure that this child needed to feel some warmth from me. So, when he'd pass by, I'd ruffle his hair or pat him on the arm. Toward the end of that year, the kids on my bus gave me a small trophy inscribed \"To the Best Bus Driver Ever\". I propped it up on the dashboard. On top I hung a small tin heart that a little girl had given me. In red paint she had written, \"I love Polly and Polly loves me.\" On the next-to-last day of school I was delayed a few minutes talking to the principal. When I got on the bus I realized that the tin heart was gone. \"Does anyone know what happened to the little heart that was up here?\" I asked. For once with 39 children, there was silence. One boy piped up, \"Charlie was the first one on the bus. I bet  he took it.\" Other children joined the chorus, \"Yeah! Charlie did it! Search him!\" I asked Charlie, \"Have you seen the heart?\" \"I don't know what you're talking about,\" he protested . Standing up, he took a few pennies and a small ball out of his pockets. \"See, I don't have it.\" \"I bet he does!\" insisted the girl who had given me the heart. \"Check his pockets.\" Charlie glowered when I asked him to come forward. His gaze burned into mine. I stuck my hand into one pocket. Nothing. I reached into the other pocket. Then I felt it ---the familiar outline of the small tin heart. Charlie stared at me for a long time. There were no tears in those big gray eyes, no plea  for mercy. _ I was about to pull the tin heart out of Charlie's pocket when I stopped myself.

{"answer": 3, "choices": ["gentle and smart", "cold and firm", "naughty and lazy", "tough and lonely"], "question": "After 20 years as a full-time wife and mother, I decided to be a school bus driver for I loved kids. After hard practice, by the time school started that year I'd gotten the hang of it. I was happy in my new work. I became a combination of chauffeur, nurse and friend. And if the kids needed it, I'd put on my \"Tough Big Sister\" act. It was a lot like my previous job---being a mom. When I think about my years of bus driving, many things crowded in, but mostly, I remember Charlie. Charlie, eight years old, with blond hair and crystalline gray eyes, began riding my bus in September of my fourth year driving. They all had stories to tell me about their summers. Charlie, though, ignored me. He didn't even answer when I asked his name. From that day on, Charlie was a trial. If a fight broke out I didn't have to turn my head to know who had started it. If someone was throwing spitballs I could guess the culprit's name. If a girl was crying, chances were Charlie had pulled her hair. No matter how I spoke to him, gently or firmly, he wouldn't say a word. He'd just stare at me with those big gray eyes of his. I asked around some, and found out Charlie's father was dead and he didn't live with his mother. He deserves my patience, I thought. So I practiced every bit of patience I could muster. To my cheery \"Good Morning\", he was silent. When I wished him a happy Halloween, he sneered. Many, many times I asked God how I could reach Charlie. \"I'm at my wit's end.\" I'd say. Still I was sure that this child needed to feel some warmth from me. So, when he'd pass by, I'd ruffle his hair or pat him on the arm. Toward the end of that year, the kids on my bus gave me a small trophy inscribed \"To the Best Bus Driver Ever\". I propped it up on the dashboard. On top I hung a small tin heart that a little girl had given me. In red paint she had written, \"I love Polly and Polly loves me.\" On the next-to-last day of school I was delayed a few minutes talking to the principal. When I got on the bus I realized that the tin heart was gone. \"Does anyone know what happened to the little heart that was up here?\" I asked. For once with 39 children, there was silence. One boy piped up, \"Charlie was the first one on the bus. I bet  he took it.\" Other children joined the chorus, \"Yeah! Charlie did it! Search him!\" I asked Charlie, \"Have you seen the heart?\" \"I don't know what you're talking about,\" he protested . Standing up, he took a few pennies and a small ball out of his pockets. \"See, I don't have it.\" \"I bet he does!\" insisted the girl who had given me the heart. \"Check his pockets.\" Charlie glowered when I asked him to come forward. His gaze burned into mine. I stuck my hand into one pocket. Nothing. I reached into the other pocket. Then I felt it ---the familiar outline of the small tin heart. Charlie stared at me for a long time. There were no tears in those big gray eyes, no plea  for mercy. _ I was about to pull the tin heart out of Charlie's pocket when I stopped myself.

However, if you've never been to the scene before, you might be disappointed at the final photos. Base your chosen spot on what you feel like photographing---whether that is buildings, people, busy streets, a festival, nature and so on, and make sure the place you're heading for is filled with what you most want to shoot. It will pay off in a satisfying walk if you research your chosen spot beforehand and know what to expect. Invite anyone, no matter what their skill level is You'll be surprised at what you learn from people who seem to know nothing about photography.

Even with a simple camera, they can catch some outstanding photos. So bring Aunt Betty or your 10-year-old nephew or anyone else whose company you might enjoy on a walk and keep an open mind. Don't forget them Be sure to take the important small things, such as an extra memory card (or two), an extra fully charged battery, comfortable shoes and clothing. And remember a notepad and pen for taking down notes about places, times, conditions, the names and information of people you meet and any other information you might want to remember about certain shots. Keep an eye out for danger Apart from watching the sky for rain, you'll want to watch out for other people as well. Smartphones are always a target for thieves but they have become much clearer about the value of digital cameras. Don't make yourself a target by standing for a very long time holding your camera out in front of you. If you're in an area that is really busy or you aren't super comfortable, then just be careful about when to use your camera. Imagine your shot in your head before holding up your camera, or use a camera belt wrapped around your wrist or shoulder.

{"answer": 2, "choices": ["forgetful", "confused", "cheerful", "uneasy"], "question": "For as early as I could remember, my mother had been a bright, cheerful woman deeply interested and involved in the world around her. However, in the last fifteen years of her life, she had to live with senile dementia  . I would go to my home to pay her a visit in California and she would curiously look at me and then ask, \"Who are you?\" I would answer, \"I'm your own son, of course.\" \"Where do you live?\" She would ask. \"In Virginia\", I would tell her. \"Isn't that interesting,\" she would say, \"I have a son in Virginia.\" Mother seemed only forgetful as well as confused at the beginning of that disease, but sometime later she would go through different time of intense anxiety. She would keep walk ing through the house she used to live in most of her life crying uneasily that she would like to go home. Or sometimes she left home and wandered away if she were unattended for a short time. Hoping to make her happy and put her mind at ease I would take her in my car, visiting sites where she used to live when she was a child. In the yard of the hillside house in Shipman I sat in the car and admired the view of the old oaks and long green lawn . I _ my mother there was a little girl playing with the pet lamb she had been so fond of. I looked to her for some response. She shook her head and said, \"I want to go home.\" Over the years I have decided that what my mother was calling home was not a place, but a time. I think it was a time when she was much younger, when her children were still underfoot, when her husband was still energetic and attentive. Watching my mother's suffering set me wondering where I would have in mind if someday I couldn't find home and wanted to go there. In this family we tend to be long-lived and we grow fuzzy   minded as the years go by. At eighty I have already noticed some alarming symptoms. My doctor says the forgetfulness is only natural and that it comes with age. Still the fear of senile dementia is haunting there. Someday if and when I become even more cloudy minded than I am now, unable to drive and unable to tell you where \"home\" is, my dear son, I expect I will ask you to take me home, I know you will do your best to find the place I need to be.

{"answer": 0, "choices": ["Warmth", "Milk", "contact", "trust"], "question": "The baby monkey is much more developed at brith than the human baby. Almost from the moment it is born,the baby monkey can move around and hold tightly to its mother. During the first few days of its life the baby will approach and hold onto almost any large,warm, and soft object in its environment , particularly if that object also gives it milk. After a week or so , however, the baby monkey begins to avoid newcomers and focuses its attentions on \"mother\"-----the real mother or the mother-substitute . During the first two weeks of its life warmth is perhaps the most important psychological thing that a monkey mother has to give to its baby. The Harlows, a couple who are both psychologists, discovered this fact by offering baby monkeys a choice of two types of mother-substitutes ----one covered with cloth and one make of bare wire. IF the two artificial mothers were both the same temperature, the little monkeys always preferred the cloth mother. However, if the wire model was heated, while the cloth model was cool, for the first two weeks after brith the baby monkeys picked the warm wire mother-substitutes as their favorites. Thereafter they switched and spent most of their time on the more comfortable cloth mother. Why is cloth preferable to bare wire? Sometime that the Harlows called contact comfort seems to be the answer, and a most powerful influence it is. Baby monkeys spend much of their time rubbing against their mothers' skins, putting themselves in as close contact with the parent as they can. Whenever the young animal is frightened, disturbed, or annoyed, it typically rushes to its mother and rubs itself against her body. Wire does n't \"rub\"as well as does soft cloth. Prolonged \"contact comfort\" with a cloth mother appears to give the babies confidence and is much more rewarding to them than is either warmth or milk. According to the Harlows, the basic quality of a baby's love for its mother is trust. If the baby is put into an unfamiliar playroom without its mother, the baby ignores the toys no matter how interesting they might be. It screams in terror and curls up into a furry little ball. If its cloth mother is now introduced into the playroom, the baby rushes to it and holds onto it for dear life. After a few minutes of contact comfort, it obviously begins to feel more secure. It then climbs down from the mother-substitute and begins to explore the toys, but often rushes back for a deep embrace   as if to make sure that its mother is still there and that all is well.

Now that we are aware of the effects that diet products have on us, it is time to seriously think about buying them. Losing weight lies in the power of minds, not in the power of chemicals. Once we realize this, we will be much better able to resist diet products, and therefore prevent the psychological harm that comes from using them .

Gilbert broke the world record for pull-ups in 1900 and the distance record for running long dive in 1902. And he won a gold medal in the pole vault at the Olympic Games in 1908.

Now it turns out that they may not be good for our minds, either. A new study of more than 260,000 people has found a link between sweetened soft-drinks and depression, and diet sodas may be making matters worse. Americans drink far more sodas than people in other countries-- as much as 170 liters per person per year. But the impact of this study isn't limited to the United States. \"Sweetened drinks, coffee and tea are commonly consumed worldwide and have important physical consequences. And they may have important mental-health consequences as well,\" study author Dr Honglei Chen said in a statement. The study studied 263,925 people between the ages of 50 and 71.

One year, two guys took the class and did pretty well on all the quizzes and mid-terms. They each had a solid A. These two friends were so confident in going into the final that the weekend before finals week, despite the Chemistry final being on Monday, they decided to go to the University of Virginia to party with some friends. They had a great time there. However, with their hangovers and tiredness, they overslept all day Sunday and didn't make it back to Duke until early Monday morning. Rather than taking the final then, they found professor Bonk after the final and explained to him how they missed the final. They told him they went up to the University of Virginia for the weekend and had planned to come back in time to study, but they had a flat tire on the way back and didn't have a spare. So they were late getting back to campus. Bonk thought this over and agreed that they could take the final the following day. The two guys, happy and relieved, studied that night and went in the next day at the time that Bonk had told them. He placed them in separate rooms and handed each of them a test booklet. He told them to begin. They looked at the first problem which was something simple about solution . It was worth 5 points. \"Cool,\" they thought, \"this is going to be an easy final\".

{"answer": 3, "choices": ["When did the writer leave school?", "How was the writer's life as a dropout?", "What future plans did the writer have in San Francisco?", "What did the writer's parents say when he dropped out?"], "question": "As a high school dropout myself, I often feel it is my duty to defend my fellow non-scholars. Common wisdom would have you believe we are the \"bad kids\", the future criminals, the worst sort of people. But not all dropouts will deal drugs, shoplift, or even shoot pool all day. My own favorite hooky hangout was always the public library. My early retirement meant that at last I had the time to read everything I wanted to. Best of all was the time I finally had to myself. I felt uncontrolled and free. I had been in school nearly my whole life. I wanted to find out for myself who I was, and until I did, everything else felt like a waste of time. To be honest, though, my daily life as a dropout consisted mostly of long hot baths, afternoon naps, and microwave food. After nearly three years of such self-centered pleasure, a series of strange thoughts began to enter my mind continuously. Images of myself at the age of 35-still living at home, collecting dust balls on the couch, reading the same book over and over-began to bother me in my sleep. And a voice in my head began asking over and over, \"Who is paying the hot water bills? Who buys the microwave pizza?\" The answer, of course, was my poor old parents. Sure, I was having a wonderful time doing plenty of nothing, discovering myself and all, but they were getting a raw deal. What parents long to see their child drop out of school, with no plans for the future? Could they be expected to support me forever? Certainly not. I had been visited by Our Lady of Perpetual Responsibility, and there was no looking back. I immediately moved out of the house and out of town, in search of a future for myself.

It took almost a year and 14 trades, but Kyle MacDonald has been offered a two-storey farmhouse in Kipling, Sask., for a paid role in a movie. MacDonald began his quest last summer when he decided he wanted to live in a house. He didn't have a job, so instead of posting a resume, he looked at a red paper clip on his desk and decided to trade it on an Internet website. The response was immediate --a fish pen was offered for exchange. MacDonald then bartered the fish pen for a handmade doorknob from a potter in Seattle. In Massachusetts, MacDonald traded the doorknob for a camp stove. He traded the stove to a U.S. soldier in California for a generator. Then he exchanged the generator for an \"instant party kit\" -- an empty keg  and an illuminated Budweiser beer sign. MacDonald then traded the keg and sign for a snowmobile.

{"answer": 2, "choices": ["The environment.", "Mother's sensitivity.", "Their peers", "Education before birth."], "question": "Not long ago, people thought babies were not able to learn things until they were five or six months old. Yet doctors in the United States say babies begin learning on their first day of life. Scientists note that babies are strongly influenced by their environment. They say a baby will smile if her mother does something the baby likes. A baby learns to get the best care possible by smiling to please her mother or other caregiver. This is how babies learn to connect and communicate with other human beings. One study shows that babies can learn before they are born. The researchers placed a tape recorder on the stomach of a pregnant woman. Then, they played a recording of a short story.  On the day the baby was born, the researchers attempted to find if he knew the sounds of the story repeated while in his mother. They did this by placing a device in the mouth of the newborn baby. The baby would hear the story if he moved his mouth one way. If the baby moved his mouth the other way, he would hear a different story. The researchers say the baby clearly liked the story he heard before he was born. They say the baby would move his mouth so he could hear the story again and again. Another study shows how mothers can strongly influence social development and language skills in their children. Researchers studied the children from the age of one month to three years. The researchers attempted to measure the sensitivity of the mothers. The women were considered sensitive if they supported their children's activities and did not interfere unnecessarily. They tested the children for thinking and language development when they were three years old. Also, the researchers observed the women for signs of depression. The children of depressed women did not do as well in tests as the children of women who did not suffer from depression. The children of depressed women did poorly in tests of language skills and understanding what they hear. These children also were less cooperative and had more problems dealing with other people.

Lots of us are using Twitter and Facebook to thumb rides, and not just to school. It's awkward to be refused when you call a friend and ask for a ride. But with Twitter, you just look for other people heading the same way. It may sound risky, so many teens stay within their own social circles to find rides, and don't branch out beyond friends when asking on Twitter just like me, but to some young people, especially those taking longer trips, stranger danger is less of a concern. \"I think the digital connection of young people is really key, because younger generations grew up sharing things on line, sharing files, photos, music, etc, so they've been very used to sharing,\" said Juliet Schor, a sociology professor at Boston College.

{"answer": 0, "choices": ["US Young Not Voting", "US Young and Their President", "Young People's Power", "Voting for the New US President"], "question": "The US will have a new president this fall. Voters will decide between the Democratic candidate  , Hillary Clinton, and Donald Trump of the Republicans. But the voting is not a must for each person in the US. So quite a lot of people choose not to vote, especially the young generation. According to Fox News, one-in-five young voters between the ages of 18 and 35 said clearly that they wouldn't vote for either of the two candidates. Just 12 percent of voters aged 35-54, and only nine percent of voters aged 55 and older said the same thing. This is not only because young people don't like Clinton or Trump, according to theFortunemagazine. The truth is that they are traditionally less likely to vote than their parents. \"Young people are not at an age in their life when they think politics or government has anything to do with them,\" said Rodd Freitag, a political science professor at the University of Wisconsin-Eau Claire, US. \"But for the older age groups, they have a home, they pay taxes  , they care about schools and the community.\" Many believe that the civic   education of an American youth is another reason why they don't vote. Students usually just do community services like cleaning the neighborhoods. This means they haven't learned how to link real life problems to politics through voting, according to Christopher Beem, a politics professor at the Pennsylvania State University.

It marks a big change in the lives of young adults. However, it ought to mean even more. It ought to mean that the graduate is ready for college or career. In a report issued last year, we found that almost half of recent Illinois high school graduates required remedial courses  upon enrolling  a community college. These courses require time and money to complete, yet offer no credits toward a degree. Too often, students never get through those remedial courses and end up dropping out of college. Why is the remediation rate so high? A large part of the reason is that we have not set high enough standards for what our students need to learn from kindergarten to high school. They simply aren't equipped with the knowledge and skills they need to succeed. The same is true for careers. In Illinois, good jobs continue to go vacant  even while we are trying hard to go through tough economic times. This is due largely to the mismatch between the skills and knowledge we provide our students with and what employers in a modern economy need workers to know. The good news is that in Illinois we have a plan to help get our students ready for life in the real world.

Bad environmental conditions, such as drought, flood, heat and other stresses, affect yields  more than crop pests and diseases.

Plant cells produce proteins   and ship them to different parts of the cell. Under normal conditions, these proteins are folded into their normal, healthy structures as they are produced. When a plant is under stress, its cells produce poorly folded or unfolded proteins. Then a built-in system senses this and \"sets off an alarm in the cell,\" said Howell.

The report says during the rest of this century, Africa's population will grow from about 3.5 billion to 5.1 billion over the next 85 years John is director of the United Nations Population Division. He says that in the past, researchers thought population growth in Africa would be similar to that of other areas. They expected slower growth rates as birth control use became more widespread. But he says those ideas were wrong. \"The level of contraception use has continued to increase but slowly -- more slowly than expected, and birthrate therefore has been falling less rapidly than expected, and the population therefore continues to grow somewhat more rapidly than we expected.The new findings are based on a joint research project of the United Nations and the University of Washington. The researchers believe the population of Asia will reach five billion by 2050. That is up from the current 4.4 billion. And then begin to decline. The researchers also believe that North America, Europe, Latin America and the Caribbean area will have a total population of below one billion.

Mary Graham, vice president of South Carolina's Charleston Metro Chamber of Commerce states, \"This is the future...If you're going to be building new library facilities, this is what you need to be doing.\" It is our generation that will be the guinea pigs of increasing technology like this. Is this a good or bad thing? Well, digital libraries may help the environment by not using paper; however, I feel like something will always be lacking with a digital book. A digital library is just the beginning. With all of this new technology, people seem to be more absorbed in their own world. One of my biggest complaints is when I am with my friends and they can't seem to get off their smart phone and talk to me. To make plans with a friend and then have them stuck on their phone the whole time is extremely rude. Not only is it disrespectful, but it reflects the direction of where human interactions are heading. Though social media is great, it also is addicting and has negative effects. Often when I go on Facebook it just makes me feel worse about myself. I'll see many of my 800 Facebook friends showing off their newest accomplishment or acceptance to college. Additionally, our society is becoming increasingly lazy. For instance, instead of doing mental math, people use their phone to solve 89 + 74. It is simple tasks like these that are allowing people to lack important educational and social skills. It is up to us to find a balance between technology and human values and interactions. With new technology being created every day, we need to learn how to use it alongside our great minds. After all, inventions are supposed to benefit society not harm it. In the day of technology, who knows what's next? The tone of the passage is best described as  _  .", "subject": ""}

Today,free smart phone apps can give runners information on things like the number and length of their steps,their heart rate,even the estimated volume of oxygen they consume per minute.All this information can act as a reward and a motivator for the runner.\"It's one thing to hear encouragement from a coach.\"Bryan Boyle,editor of Runner's World magazine,explains.\"It's quite another,however,to appreciate-at a glance-progress made during weeks and months of running.'' But run--tracking technology doesn't just help runners train harder. It also gives them the power to train more intelligently.Recreational runners today no longer have to guess how far or how fast they've run,or what their body is doing.If they can monitor their heart rate,they can make sure they're hitting the most strategic pace on each run,which can significantly increase their chances of having a positive experience on the course during race day. No matter how much technology can promote the experience of running,though,many runners argue that the biggest benefit of the sport remains the chance to get outdoors,away from the computer,for an hour.\"There's so much more to experience,\" adds Boyle.\"fresh air,travel,shoot,just overall feeling better.There's no app for that.\" As for the experienced runners,what attracts them most is  _  .", "subject": ""}

With his father away on night duty at a local factory, Glenn was worried about the safety of his mother, his sister Karen, 14 and his 12-year-old brother Todd. He ran downstairs through the smoke-filled house to push and pull at Karen and Todd until they sat up. Then he helped each one through the house to the safety of the garden. There, his sister and brother, taking short and quick breaths and coughing, collapsed on the lawn.     The nine-year-old raced back into the house and upstairs to his mother's room. He found it impossible to wake her up. Mrs. Kreamer, a victim of the smoke, was unconscious, and there was nobody to help Glenn carry her to the garden. But the boy remained calm and , as a fireman said later, \"acted with all the self-control of a trained adult.\"    On the bedroom telephone, luckily still working, Glenn called his father and, leaving Mr. Kreamer to telephone the fire brigade and ambulance service, got on with the task of saving his mother.    First he filled a bucket with water from the bathroom and threw water over his mother and her bed. Then, with a wet cloth around his head he went back to the garden.

Between 1815 and 1914, the world witnessed the greatest peaceful migration in its history: 35 million people, mostly Europeans, left their homelands to start new lives in America. Why did these people risk everything by leaving their homes and families? First, what forced emigrants to make the decision to leave? One major cause for European farmers to leave was the rise in population which in turn led to land hunger. Another was politics. There was an increased taxation and the growth of armies, and many young men fled eastern Europe to avoid being forced to join the army. Physical hunger provided another pressing reason. Following the collapse  of the economy of southern Italy in the 1860s, hundreds of thousands decided to start a new life in America. Religion also encouraged millions to leave the Old World. In short, people chose to leave their homes for social, economic and religious reasons. As a result, by 1890 among a total population of 63 million, there were more than nine million foreign-born Americans. But what were the attractions? First of all, there was the promise of land which was so scarce in Europe. Next, factories were calling for workers, and pay conditions were much better than back home. Men were needed to open up the West and build the long railroads, and new towns needed settlers to live in and to develop business. There was the space for religious people to practice their faith in peace. This immigration meant that by around the 1850s Americans of non-English had started to be more than those of English. As we know, there were losers. To start with, there were those unwilling immigrants, the slaves who had been used as a source of cheap labour. Nor should we forget the equally unlucky American Indians. By 1860 there were 27 million free whites, four million slaves and a mere 488,000 free blacks.

Between 1815 and 1914, the world witnessed the greatest peaceful migration in its history: 35 million people, mostly Europeans, left their homelands to start new lives in America. Why did these people risk everything by leaving their homes and families? First, what forced emigrants to make the decision to leave? One major cause for European farmers to leave was the rise in population which in turn led to land hunger. Another was politics. There was an increased taxation and the growth of armies, and many young men fled eastern Europe to avoid being forced to join the army. Physical hunger provided another pressing reason. Following the collapse  of the economy of southern Italy in the 1860s, hundreds of thousands decided to start a new life in America. Religion also encouraged millions to leave the Old World. In short, people chose to leave their homes for social, economic and religious reasons. As a result, by 1890 among a total population of 63 million, there were more than nine million foreign-born Americans. But what were the attractions? First of all, there was the promise of land which was so scarce in Europe. Next, factories were calling for workers, and pay conditions were much better than back home. Men were needed to open up the West and build the long railroads, and new towns needed settlers to live in and to develop business. There was the space for religious people to practice their faith in peace. This immigration meant that by around the 1850s Americans of non-English had started to be more than those of English. As we know, there were losers. To start with, there were those unwilling immigrants, the slaves who had been used as a source of cheap labour. Nor should we forget the equally unlucky American Indians. By 1860 there were 27 million free whites, four million slaves and a mere 488,000 free blacks. Nowadays, the USA is still seen by millions as the Promised Land. As always, it remains an attractive place to those who think it will offer them a second chance.

{"answer": 3, "choices": ["Sad people are always depressed.", "Depressed people are sad all the time.", "Happy people will never feel depressed.", "Depressed people do not always feel sad."], "question": "One of the most popular and enduring myths about depression is that depressed people are sad all the time--and that by extension, people who are happy can't be experiencing depression, even if they say they are. It is a mistaken version of depression. Depression doesn't make you sad all the time. When I'm having a depressive feeling, I'm not walking around in black clothes, and weeping. I go out with friends. I play jokes. I keep working, and have friendly chats with the people I work with. I read books. Above all, I experience moments of happiness. Yet I feel a strange conflicting pressure. On the one hand, I feel like I need to engage in a sort of sadness for people to understand that I really am depressed and that each day is a struggle for me. Because that way I will appear suitably sad, and thus, depressed--and then maybe people will recognize that I'm depressed and perhaps they'll even offer support and assistance. On the other hand, I feel an extreme pressure to perform just the opposite, because sad depressed people are boring and no fun, as I am continually reminded every time I speak openly about depression or express feelings of sadness and frustration. I'm caught in a trap where if I don't perform sadness, I'm not really depressed, but if I express sadness at all to any degree, I'm annoying and boring and should stop being so self-centered. Depression can become your master, but you can slip out from under it occasionally.

It may be because we're drawn to depressing stories without realizing, according to psychologists. When you read the news, sometimes it can feel like the only things reported are terrible, depressing events. Why do the media concentrate on the bad things in life, rather than the good? In fact, many people often say that they would prefer good news. The researchers present their experiment as solid evidence of a so called \"negativity bias \", psychologists' term for our collective hunger to hear, and remember bad news. It isn't just delight in other people's misfortune, the theory goes, but that we've evolved to react quickly to potential threats. Bad news could be a signal that we need to change what we're doing to avoid danger. As you'd expect from this theory, there's some evidence that people respond quicker to negative words. In lab experiments, flash the word \"cancer\", \"bomb\" or \"war\" up at someone and they can hit a button in response quicker than if that word is \"baby\", \"smile\" or \"fun\". We are also able to recognize negative words faster than positive words, and even tell that a word is going to be unpleasant before we can tell exactly what the word is going to be. There's another interpretation  that researchers put on their evidence: we pay attention to bad news, because on the whole, we think the world is more hopeful than it actually is.

Or when you're in love, why do you speak of roses and honey? When we do these things, we, too are artists. We're using something that goes beyond a mere scientific description in order to communicate our feelings more powerfully than straightforward words can. So consider for a moment that Van Gogh might not have been hallucinating on the night he painted this. Maybe he felt something so powerful that he had to go beyond the familiar to express it. I hope I'mreminding you of something you already know as I describe the experience of being outside at night under a crystal clear sky that makes everything seem clean and refreshing. So you look up. And suddenly you see the sky that you've seldom seen before. It's not just the same old dark night sky tonight. Instead, the blackness is a deep, rich blue that is more bottomless than any ocean. The stars are not spots of light but brilliant, magical diamonds that dance like tiny angels. In just this special moment, the sky is somehow alive, and it seems to speak to you silently about the meaning of infinity. Now look at the painting again. Can you see something of what makes this such a famous and well-loved image? But there's more here than that. Van Gogh paintedthis while he was quite struck down by a mental disease. It is natural to imagine that he frequently battled the fear that he would never escape hisprisonto true freedom. It is natural for us to imagine this because each of us has faced our own personal prison, whether it be disease, the loss of a loved one, serious financial problems ... In such moments it is tempting to give up to despair and collapse in hopelessness. Looking at this painting, I imagine Van Gogh in just such a moment of despair, when he isstruck by the memory of one of those amazing night skies. He recalls the sense that he is not alone, that there is a living, infinite world with rich colorful creatures and scenes all around. And so the sky flows across the canvas full of vitality and power. The stars don't just sparkle; they explode. Looking closer, we notice that the earth itself seems to respond to the movement in the sky, forming its own living waves in the mountain and rolling trees. In the sleepy village, the windows of the houses glow with the same light that brightens the universe. The giant trees at the left seem to capture the joy by stretching upwards toward the sky. What a tremendous message of hope there is in this masterpiece! Even if our troubles persist, the world around us assures us that life is worth living. That's what the angels sing about.

Good teachers can change lives.\" Katherine Applegate has won many awards for her books, including the Newbery Medal for The One and Only Ivan. She also created the Animorphs series with her husband, Michael Grant.\"My sixth-grade teacher in Michigan sensed that 1 wanted to write,so one day she sent me home to write about the word'blue'in as many ways as possible. Because of that,for the first time in my life, I thought of myself as someone with special skills as a writer, someone who was unique. My teacher's actions said'I see something special in you.'\" In his role as U.S.Secretary of Education, Arne Duncan is in charge of the department that collects data and directs research on America's schools.\"My high school English teacher was amazing. She challenged us to express our ideas clearly in class and in our writing. There was no such thing as a bad question. She wanted to hear from us and encouraged us to speak up and express ourselves. She pulled things out of me that I didn't know I had inside. I think that is the genius of good teachers.\" What does the passage mainly tell us?", "subject": ""}

This book benefit was seen across countries, and held regardless of the parent's educational back-ground, father's occupation or the political system of the country, the researchers say. The results, based on data from 73,249 people living in 27 countries, including the United States, show that having a 500-book library boosted a child's education by 3.2 years on average. \"You get a great effect for your books,\" said study researcher Mariah Evans, a sociologist at the University of Nevada, Reno. \"It's quite a good return-on-investment in a time of scarce resources.\" For years, educators have thought the strongest predictor of attaining high levels of education was having parents who were highly educated. But according to the findings, a good-sized book library is just as good as university-educated parents in terms of increasing education level. \"Even a little bit goes a long way,\" in terms of the number of books in a home, Evans said. Having as few as 20 books in the home still has a significant impact on propelling a child to a higher level of education, and the more books are added, the greater the benefit. In some countries, such as China, having 500 or more books in the home propels children 6. 6 years further in their education. In the United States, the effect is less, 2.4 years.

In the middle of the seventh inning fans ritualistically stand and stretch before the home team comes to bat.  No one really knows the origin of the custom, but there are theories on how it started. Baseball historian Dan Daniel provided this explanation: \"It probably began as an expression of fatigue. That would explain why the stretch comes late in the game instead of at the halfway point.\" A more popular story involves President William Howard Taft and the birth of two baseball traditions. According to the account, Taft attended the first game of the 1910 baseball season. On the spur of the moment, plate umpire  Billy Evans gave Taft the ball. He asked him to throw it over the plate. Taft did so, and the custom of having the president launch the baseball season with the first pitch was born.  The story continues that later that same day, President Taft, who weighed well over 300 pounds, became uncomfortable in his small chair. In the middle of the seventh inning, he stood up to stretch his legs. The crowd thought that the president was leaving, so they stood up out of respect. A few moments later, Taft sat down again. The fans followed, and the seventh-inning stretch was born. What a day for traditions! No matter how the tradition began, fans have since added to the fun. Now, as they stand to stretch during the seventh inning, they can sing along to Jack Norworth's 1927 version of the song \"Take Me Out to the Ball Game\" after the visiting team has batted.

To some people, GM foods are no different from unmodified foods. \"A tomato is a tomato,\" said Brian Sansoni, an American food manufacturer. Critics of GM foods challenge Sansoni's opinion. They worry about the harm that GM crops might do to people, other animals, and plants. In a recent lab study conducted at Cornell University, scientists tested pollen  made by BT corn, which makes up one-fourth of the U.S. corn crop. The scientist dropped the pollen onto milkweed, a plant that is the only known food source of a butterfly caterpillar . Within four days of feeding on the leaves, almost half of a test group of caterpillars died. \"This is a warning bell.\" said Cornell researcher Linda Raynor. Some insects that are not killed by GM foods might find themselves made stronger. How so? The insecticides are used on the crops to kill the pests. But GM plants produce a continuous level of insecticide. Insects relying on those crops may develop resistance to the plants and they may also develop a resistance to the insecticide. At the forum on GM food held last year in Canada. GM crops that have been made resistant to the herbicide might crossbreed with wild plants, creating \"superweeds\" that could take over whole fields. So where do you stand? Should GM food be banned in the United States, as they are in parts of Europe? Or do their benefits outweigh  any of the risks they might carry? What happens to those insects when not killed by the spray of insecticide?", "subject": ""}

He didn't look like any doctor I'd ever known. He never yelled at us for playing in his yard. I remember him as someone who was a lot nicer than most of the adults in our community. When Dr. Gibbs wasn't saving lives, he was planting trees. His house sat on ten acres, and his life's goal was to make it a forest. The good doctor had some interesting theories concerning plant care and growth. He never watered his new trees, which flew in the face of conventional wisdom. Once I asked why. He said that watering plants spoiled them so that each successive tree generation would grow weaker and weaker. So you have to make things rough for them and weed out  the weaker trees early on. He talked about how watering trees made for shallow roots, and how trees that weren't watered had to grow deep roots in search of moisture. I took him to mean that deep roots were to be treasured. So he never watered his trees. He planted an oak and, instead of watering it every morning, he beat it with a rolled-up newspaper. Smack! Slap! Pow! I asked him why he did that, and he said it was to get the tree's attention. Dr. Gibbs passed away a couple of years after I left home. Every now and again, I walked by his house and looked at the trees that I'd watched him plant some twenty-five years ago. They're extremely tall, big and robust since they have deep roots now. However, the trees in my garden trembled in a cold wind although I had watered them for several years. It seems that adversity  and suffering benefit these trees in ways comfort and ease never could.

{"answer": 2, "choices": ["by recording higher level brain activity", "by comparing people's memories of their dreams with an electronic visualization", "by asking about people after their dreams", "by linking certain neurons with specific objects or concept"], "question": "Scientists think it will be possible to record people's dreams and then interpret them, according to a new report. They claim to have developed a system which allows them to record higher level brain activity. Dr Moran Cerf told the journal Nature: \"We would like to read people's dreams.\" Previously the only way to access people's dreams is for psychologists to ask about them after the event and try to interpret them. Dr Cerf hopes to eventually compare people's memories of their dreams with an electronic visualization  of their brain activity. He told the BBC: \"There's no clear answer as to why humans dream. And one of the questions we would like to answer is when do we actually create this dream?\" The scientist believes his latest research shows that certain neurons  or individual brain cells are linked with specific objects or concepts. He found that a particular neuron lit up when a volunteer thought about Marilyn Monroe. If a database was built up identifying various neurons with concepts, objects and people it would allow them to \"read the subject's minds\", according to Dr Cerf. However, Dr Roderick Oner, a clinical psychologist and dream expert, said that this kind of visualisation would be of limited help when it came to interpreting the \"complex dream narrative\".

The scientists say these hormonal changes may be a cause of obesity in Western societies.They note the combination that limitation is common and is widely available. The results were not affected by how much people exercised.People who are awake longer have more time to burn energy.But the researchers say loss of sleep may increase hunger especially  for high-calorie foods,so people gain weight.It seems that,for survival,the body may be designed to store more fat during times with less sleep. Researchers from Stanford University in California and the University of Wisconsin did the study.They found that the best amount of sleep for weight control is 7.7 hours a night.

Talks went smoothly but differences remained. So Martin Bayer himself, the CEO of the German Company, decided to come to Moscow to head the talks. Besides caring about his business, the CEO wanted to go to Russia to hunt bears. Martin Bayer was one of the greatest hunters of our time (and the Russians knew about it). He went to the Sahara more than hundred times and hunted lions, crocodiles; he hunted polar bears in the North Pole and tigers in the rain forests of India. But he had never hunted Russian bears. So the Russians decided to organize a bear hunt for Mr. Bayer to sweeten the talks. This wasn't a simple task. Some people in the west still believe that bears may be found and seen everywhere in Russian cities just like squirrels may be seen in our back yards. This is not true. The closest place one may find bears in the wild is maybe 2,500 miles away from Moscow. However, a solution was quickly found. The Russian businessmen went to Moscow Circus and for $2,000 bought a very old bear. This bear used to amuse and amaze audiences in many countries for 30 years, but got and looked too old, and was retired. \"Be careful, the Russian bears are very dangerous, and frightening,\" they told to Mr. Bayer. \"If compared to the Russian bears, your African lions are nothing more than harmless cats.\" The bear was brought to a forest 50 miles from Moscow and was left there. Mr. Bayer was told that bears were plentiful in that forest and that many cattle and even people had been eaten in the surrounding villages. Meanwhile, an 18-year old female drove through the forest on a motorcycle and suddenly saw a bear (no bears had been seen in those places for 200 years). She was frightened, fell, left her helmet and her motorcycle and ran away. Mr. Bayer was excited and ready to hunt. This could become the most successful part of his extraordinary hunting experience. The next moment Mr. Bayer saw a bear in a helmet driving on a motorcycle through the forest in front of him. The bear had a happy expression on his face, as he was doing something he had been doing in the circus for 30 years: circling on a motorcycle! Mr. Bayer lives in a private mental institution near Hamburg happily ever after. The equipment was never sold to Russia. It was sold to Iraq instead.

Other sources include parking fees, food and drink sales and souvenirs. Practically all amusement parks operate using one of two admission principles:         Pay-as-you-go In this form, a guest enters the park at little or no charge. The guest must then buy rides one by one, either at the attraction's entrance or by buying ride tickets. The cost of the attraction is often based on its complexity   or popularity. The park may allow guests to buy unlimited admissions to all attractions within the park. A pass is then shown at the attraction entrance to gain admission.        Disneyland opened in 1955 using the pay-as-you-go form. Initially, guests paid the ride admission fees at the attractions. Soon, the problems of dealing with so many coins led to the development of a ticket system that, while now out of use, is still part of the amusement-park vocabulary. In this new form, guests bought ticket books that contained a number of tickets, with \"A,\" \"B\" and \"C.\" Rides and attractions using an \"A-ticket\" were generally simple, with \"B-tickets\" and \"C-tickets\" used for the larger, more popular rides. Later, the \"D-ticket\" was added, then finally the now-famous \"E-ticket,\" which was used for the biggest rides, like Space Mountain. Smaller tickets could be traded up for use on larger rides.

It is well known that the examination system we are now using may be a good way of testing a student's memory, but it can tell you nothing about a student's ability. It does no good to students and teachers.  As soon as a child begins school, he enters a world of examination that will decide his future of job.  In fact a good examination system should train a student to think for himself. But it now does nothing about that. So students are encouraged to member what is taught. It does not enable them to gain more and note knowledge. The students who come out first in the examination often may not be the best in their studies.  Besides, the examinations often force teachers to train students what to do with the coming examination from time to time. There must be some simpler and better way to test a student' s ability besides knowledge. And that is what we should do at once. What is TRUE according to the passage?", "subject": ""}
{"answer": 3, "choices": ["Chocolate may be healthy for us.", "Eating too much chocolate might be harmful.", "Allowing yourself a treat like chocolate.", "Chocolate may help keep people slim."], "question": "People who eat chocolate regularly tend to be thinner, new research suggests. The findings come from a study of nearly 1,000 US people that looked at diet, calorie intake and body mass index(BMI)----a measure of obesity. It found those who ate chocolate a few times a week were, on average, slimmer than those who ate it occasionally. Even though chocolate is loaded with calories, it contains ingredients that may favour weight loss rather than fat synthesis , scientists believe. Despite boosting calorie intake, regular chocolate consumption was related to lower BMI in the study. The link remained even when other factors, like how much exercise individuals did, were taken into account. And it appears it is how often you eat chocolate that is important, rather than how much of it you eat. The study found no link with quantity consumed. Lead author Dr. Beatrice Golomb, from the University of California at San Diego, said, \"Our findings appear to add to a body of information suggesting that the composition of calories, not just the number of them, matters for determining their ultimate impact on weight.\" This is not the first time scientists have suggested that chocolate may be healthy for us. Other studies have claimed chocolate may be good for the heart. Consumption of certain types of chocolate has been linked to some favourable changes in blood pressure and insulin  sensitivity. And chocolate does contain antioxidants which can help to absorb free radicals----unstable chemicals that can damage our cells. Mice fed for 15 days with epicatechin (present in chocolate) had improved exercise performance and observable changes to their muscle composition. They say clinical trials are now needed in humans to see if this is the case. But before you reach for a chocolate bar, there are still lots of unanswered questions. And in the absence of conclusive evidence, experts advise caution. While there's no harm in allowing yourself a treat like chocolate now and then, eating too much might be harmful because it often contains a lot of sugar and fat too.

It was the worst disaster in the modern city since 58 died in an apartment building fire in 2010. The cause of the crush has still to be confirmed, though state media and some witnesses have said it was at least partly aroused when people rushed to pick up coupons that looked like bank notes. A man named Wu said the fake money had been thrown down from a bar above the street as part of the celebrations. \"This incident happened after the stampede,\" police said in a brief statement, without saying what the real cause was. Another witness said there had been a problem away from the area where the fake bills were thrown, with people trying to get on to a raised platform overlooking the river.

When Jon and Sandy go to the store or to their daughters' soccer games, they drive in high-tech style. They drive a $1 million, fuel-cell-powered car.

The FCX uses hydrogen and oxygen for fuel. Car makers have been working to develop vehicles that are better for the environment. They are developing cars that use fuel other than gasoline. And then what is fuel cell technology? Fuel cell technology works by changing the chemicals hydrogen and oxygen into water. This process produces electricity, and water vapor which comes out of the exhaust pipe. Most cars release dangerous gases such as carbon monoxide and carbon dioxide.

By closing tome  at 9.20 a.m., the shop usually sells 90 drinks. \"Whoever made the chi tea, Ms. Schatzman says it was good,\" Christy McKinley, a second year student, announced recently, after hanging up with the teacher. The shop is called the Dixie PIT, which stands for Power in Transition. Although some of the students are not disabled, many are, and the PIT helps them prepare for life after high school. They learn not only how to run a coffee shop but also how to deal with their affairs. They keep a timecard and receive paychecks, which they keep in check registers. Special-education teachers Kim Chevalier and Sue Casey introduced the Dixie PIT from a similar program at Kennesaw Mountain High School in Georgia. Not that it was easy. Chevalier's first problem to overcome was product-related. Should school be selling coffee? What about sugar content? Kenton County Food Service Director Ginger Gray helped.

He is eventually let go after four days, but his injured friend disappears. When he returns, Marcus discovers that there are many \"security measures\" in place and that now all citizens are treated like potential terrorists. While some consider this government action necessary for public safety, Marcus sees this as a complete _ of the rights he is supposed to have as a citizen.

A report by the Bank of Scotland interviewed over 1,000 young people in Britain and found that 77% get pocket money. Different families give different amounts of pocket money. The average for eight-to-fifteen-year-olds in the UK is about PS6 a week. Children in Scotland receive slightly more than the national average and Londoners get the most. Teenagers, logically, get more money than younger children. Some fifteen-to-nineteen-year-olds receive more than PS100 a month. The report found that many children save at least a quarter of their weekly pocket money and that more boys than girls save their money. Lots of young people have to do housework to get their pocket money. They help at home with jobs like cleaning and cooking. A part-time job is a choice for teenagers who don't have pocket money or who want to earn extra money. About 15% of teenagers have a job. Popular part-time jobs for teenagers include delivering newspapers, shop work, and working in a restaurant or cafe. There are strict government laws about working hours. Only children over 13 can work (there are some exceptions, for example, for actors.) On a school day they can work a maximum of 2 hours a day but not during school hours. At weekends and during school holidays they can work longer hours. The national minimum wage for people aged 16-17 is PS3.57 per hour. 18-year-olds must earn a minimum of PS4.83.

Here is the challenge: Kids need to explore the world in new ways, and parents need to protect them from the dangers that are out in that world. These conflicts can easily set off fireworks in otherwise calm houses. Sometimes conflicts can't be avoided. But by paying attention to the building blocks of successful relationships, you can work towards making home a happy and healthy place for you and your parents. For instance, try to find a time to talk when your parents are not angry, tired, distracted, or hungry. A good time to talk is when you're all relaxed . Timing is everything. If the conversation begins to turn into an argument, you'd better calmly and coolly ask to stop the conversation for now. You can pick it up again when everyone's more relaxed. Listen to what your parents are saying, and repeat it back to them. This shows them that you're listening. It also gives them a chance to clear things up if you're not on the same page. Respect is the building block of good communication. People who respect each other and care about each others' feelings can disagree without things getting ugly. You are more likely to get along with your parents and have more independence  if your parents believe in you. How do you build trust? Trust comes by actually doing what you say you're going to do. Some teens find that doing fun activities with their parents can improve their relationships. Sometimes we forget that parents are more than rule-makers---they're interesting people who like to watch movies, and go shopping ---just like their teenagers! What do you do if you are trying your best, but your relationship with your parents continues to be rocky ? You may consider seeking outside help. You can find supportive adults, such as a teacher or a coach, who can r. Remember you can only change your own behavior; your parents are the only ones who can change theirs.

{"answer": 2, "choices": ["They are fast, flexible and accurate.", "They usually function normally.", "They have no sense of what is right or wrong.", "They are honest and have no reason to steal money."], "question": "In many businesses, computers have largely replaced paperwork, because they are fast, flexible, and do not make mistakes. As one banker said, \"Unlike humans, computers never have a bad day.\" And they are honest. Many banks advertise that their transactions are \"untouched by human hands\" and therefore safe from human temptation. Obviously, computers have no reason to steal money. But they also have no conscience, and the growing number of computer crimes shows they can be used to steal. Computer criminals don't use guns. And even they are caught, it is hard to punish them because there are no witnesses and often no evidence. A computer cannot remember who used it: it simply does what it is told. The head teller at a New York City Bank used a computer to steal more than one and a half billion dollars in just four years. No one noticed this theft because he moved the money from one account to another. Each time a customer he had robbed questioned the balance in his account, the teller claimed a computer error, then replaced the missing money from someone else's account. This man was caught only because he was a gambler. When the police broke up an illegal gambling operation, his name was in the records. Some employees use the computer's power to get revenge on employers they consider unfair. Recently, a large insurance company fired its computer-tape librarian for reasons that involved her personal rather than her professional life. She was given thirty days' notice. In those thirty days, she erased all the company's computerized records. Most computer criminals have been minor employees. Now police wonder if this is \"the tip of the iceberg\".

Are there any solutions? Use public transportation, such as trains, trams, buses and taxis. These modes of transport carry a large number of people at one time and greatly reduce the number of cars on the road.Moreover, it will save you from driving stress, save time and help the environment. If you have an empty seat in your car, consider car pooling by finding other people who might be headed to a destination near yours. This will not only help reduce traffic congestion, but also journey expenses.In addition, it will decrease driving stress as each person would get a break from driving.This is also environmentally friendly and a sustainable way to travel as it would reduce carbon. emissions. By raising gasoline taxes, the government would have extra funds to construct highways, subways and alternative roads.

After battling with student finance, deciding whether or not to take a year out can be as terrifying as deciding where to move to for the three years. Some students will have planned their year out for months, but, for others, slipped grades may force a gap year , either to retake exams or to apply to different universities. Others might just need time to think. Thankfully, for U.K. students, taking a gap year remains a good option and it can be one of the most productive and fulfilling years of their life. Whether you've planned and budgeted for a year abroad, or have made a last-minute decision to delay your first year, the options are endless. Traveling, volunteering and so on are all there for the talking. With so many things on offer, it's important to remember that 12 months won't be enough time to do all of them, so decide early and work towards making whatever you want to do a reality. Researching a gap year is exciting, and often the place to start is at home. Family and friends can be a great source of inspiration.

If someone else comes in, we may have to move. And here, according to Gray, lift users unthinkingly go through a set pattern of movements. He told the BBC what he had observed. He explained that when you are the only one inside a lift, you can do whatever you want--it's your own little box. If there are two of you, you go into different corners, standing diagonally  across from each other to create distance. When a third person enters, you will unconsciously form a triangle.

A physical evaluation from a physician is recommended, preferably one that includes an exercise-stress test. While a person is exercising, a stress test detects cardiovascular  problems that might not show up when the body is at rest. This is done by monitoring blood pressure, pulse rate, oxygen consumption, and the heart's electrical activity while exercising. Whatever exercise program is selected, it is important to start with warm-up periods. These should include stretching exercises, jumping jacks, or active walking. The idea is to increase heart rate and circulation slowly without placing a sudden strain on the heart or the muscles that are starting to work. The next phase in developing an exercise program is to determine the amount of exercise that is enough to condition the muscles and cardiovascular system without excessively exhausting the body. This involves taking one's pulse and finding one's target zone. This target zone, or safe-training pulse rate, is established by subtracting one's age from 220 and then taking 60 percent to 80 percent of that total.

There are more than 1,000 kinds of bamboo that grow around the world on both mountains and plains. Not all bamboo looks the same. Some bamboo plants are very thin. They may only grow to be a few centimeters wide while others may grow to more than 30 centimeters across. This plant also comes in different colors, from yellow to black to green.

The hero was about a 27-year-old professional Bass Fisherman named Clay Dyer. At first, they played it off as another guy trying to make the cut on the Bassmaster tour until they showed a picture of him. No legs, no arms, or rather, he was only1/3 of his right arm. That's all that he has. It was such an amazing story that I was wondering what this guy could do. Growing up, he learned to play baseball and basketball, but found that fishing was his true calling. And he does it all on his own. He holds the fishing pole under his chin and uses that and his stub arm to cast and reel in the fish. He uses his teeth to help him unhook fish. He ties his own hooks on with his mouth, never really asking anyone else to help. Clay Dyer even knows how to swim. Since his body can't produce enough sweat on its own, he has to take a dip in the lake every few hours to keep cool. He dives in just like anyone else, then somehow treads water  with his stub arm, then, with a little help, pulls himself back up into the boat and goes on fishing. Clay Dyer has never looked for others' pity, nor has he allowed his physical disabilities to prevent him from becoming a professional fisherman.

In many parts of the state, beavers  are pests and need to be controlled. The 10-to-12-year-old girls found out where beavers lived, set traps, and skinned the two animals they caught. The girls hope to catch ten more beavers so that the entire troop can make mittens and hats with the fur. They also want to cook beaver meat. Troop leaders and members say the Scouts are doing a good deed by helping control the state's beaver population. But animal-rights activists say trapping is cruel. They want the Girl Scouts to stop in their tracks. Beavers aren't only causing a problem in Alaska. Residents in Sampson County, N.C., have turned to a local committee to help them battle the growing beaver population there. County landowners are frustrated after the county spent more than $ 50,000 in eight years trying to reduce the beaver population through a government program. The joint state and federal program included paying money to trappers for every beaver carcass they trapped. Many local residents say that the program didn't work because there were too few trappers. That's why the county set up its own committee to investigate other ways to control the area's beaver population. The county will rely on its own beaver-trapping program. It has hired a trapper to set traps in various areas. The county will pay $10 for every beaver carcass. Why do many people say that beavers are a nuisance? For beavers to survive, they need lots of water. Water provides the large rodent  with a place to hide from meat - eating animals. Beavers also store food underwater for the winter. When there's not enough water in a particular area, beavers get busy building dams.

We admire Washington, Jefferson and Adams, but they remain creatures of the 18th century. The man we encounter in \"Benjamin Franklin\"--funny, pragmatic and selfaware -- seems like one of us, or at least someone we'd like to be. Unlike Washington's cherry tree, Franklin's kite was real. His experiments with electricity made him one of the great scientists of his day. He was a middleclass businessman whose success as a printer and a journalist allowed him to retire at 42--and he devoted the rest of his life to his country. He was diplomat who persuaded the French to back the American Revolution and the author of the first great American autobiography. He was an excellent swimmer. There was almost nothing he couldn't do well, except write poetry. But what truly distinguished Franklin was his talent of being great and human at the same time. He owned slaves as a younger man, but in his last years became an abolitionist .When he fathered an illegitimate  son, he acknowledged his fatherhood and took the responsibility of raising the boy. He seems strange today in the joy he took in compiling and creating all  those self- improvement  _ he published in Poor Richard's Almanac  -- \"early to bed, early to rise\" and so on.

Wright explained, \"Slowly, the pressure has been building up until last September when it finally cracked, breaking the crust.\" The entry of molten rock into the gap between continents, rather than the cracking of the crust, is responsible for separation of continent drifts. For the past 30 million years Africa and Arabia have been going through the continental rifting process, the same one that made the Red Sea part again. \"The ground is continually moving---much more rapidly now than before,\" Wright said. \"On average, the two sides move apart at about 2 centimeters per year.\" This latest split, added to the long-term rifting process could eventually create a huge new sea.

Many people are fascinated by China's sport legends in history.

The game was very popular and women were also participating. Now, you will understand why our women football team is so good today.

We were laughing, but the laughter quickly turned to silence when we saw the look on my dad's face. \"What are you boys doing?\" he asked . \"We're just sort of helping to get rid of the grasshoppers,\" I said. \"This isn't 'getting rid of grasshoppers,'\" Dad said. \"This is killing.\" I was confused. I looked at the insecticide he was carrying. \"But aren't you going to kill grasshoppers with that?\" I asked. \"Yes, because it's something we need to do for the protection of our garden,\" he said seriously. \"But I'm not going to enjoy it.\" In which magazine would you most probably find this passage?", "subject": ""}

Thanks to her voice, singing style as well as her image, which resembles the legendary Teng, Viseskul gained overnight fame, though she didn't win the competition at last. However, it seemed that her life did become different after the reality show. With nearly 100,000 followers on her Sina Weibo account, Viseskul was recognized by the Ministry of Tourism and Sports of the Kingdom of Thailand and the Tourism Authority of Thailand for her contribution to promoting a positive image of Thailand in China at the competition. Viseskul talks slowly and softly in fluent Chinese. It's easy to forget that she is just 16 because of her smile and calmness on and off the stage. Born in a small village of Kamphaeng Phet, Viseskul was fond of singing from the time she was 3. At 7, she listened to Teng's songs for the first time after her parents traveled back from Hong Kong, bringing home the CDs of the singer. You can hardly imagine her enthusiasm about them when spotting and listening to them. \"The moment I listened to her songs, I felt so familiar. Though I couldn't speak any Chinese, I learned the songs fast. Since then, I hoped to visit China and become a singer,\"she says, adding that she likes Chinese songs, especially those from the 1970s and 1980s. Many of her friends and  s showed great puzzlement and they just couldn't make out why she was so crazy about Chinese music. In 2014, Viseskul was admitted into the affiliated high school of the China Conservatory of Music. Now, she is studying at an international school in Beijing, focusing on learning Chinese. She also has other plans, such as furthering her studies in Japan or South Korea. However challenging it may be for her to become a superstar, she is determined to carry on regardless of any obstacles she may encounter in the future.

For several months, he lived on life support as we were forced to stand by and watch him wither away. ks5u     While his friends were out playing baseball, and sleeping in their own beds, my son was in a hospital bed, attached to a machine that kept his heart beating. As a mother, my first reaction after crying was anger, and then I played the bargaining game: \"Take my life for his, Lord. I've lived my life but he still has so much to do.\" People all around me were praying for a heart to become available, but it made me so angry and confused because I knew for that to happen, someone else's child would have to die. How could anyone pray for that?     I still remember so clearly the morning we got the call that there was a heart. As we stood in Dustin's hospital room watching them prepare him for surgery, we experienced the true definition of bittersweet. His dad and I realized that at the precise moment we were standing there with so much hope and so much love, another family somewhere was saying goodbye. We knelt down together and cried, and we prayed for them and we thanked them for giving such a selfless gift. To our amazement, just 10 days later, Dustin got to come home for the first time in many months.  He had received a second chance at life.

{"answer": 2, "choices": ["A Successful Stylist", "Road to Beauty", "My Medusa Hair", "Accept the Way We Are"], "question": "For years I fought with the bird's nest that sat on top of my head-my Medusa  hair.No matter what I did and how hard I tried, in no way could I make my unruly  hair to my satisfaction. Growing up in a Russian-Jewish home with parents who thought North American styling products were something illegal such as drugs, I was never allowed to put them in my hair. \"Why buy hair gel? Your hair is so beautiful naturally.\" my mother would say.The teens at school did not agree.From boys' not wanting to kiss me when we played spin the bottle in Grade 7 to being called the mop, I suffered from my hair. When I got to university, I believed my hair was a wall that stood between me and everything---finding a part-time job, getting a boyfriend, etc. If only I could find a way to manage the curls and put it behind bars, I told myself, I would feel secure and sexy.I tried everything: rollers, hairspray, gels and, at one point, an iron.Then, in my second year, a miracle happened.I was asked to be a hair model for Japanese hair straightening, a process by which the molecules of my curls would be broken and reset in a bone-straight position.I was the perfect candidate, the hairdresser told me.Although they said how hair relaxing could damage the scalp  , for the next five years I didn't find them to be true. All of the hairdresser's promises were fulfilled: With my hair straight and smooth, I was no longer the \" mop\". However, there was extreme damage done to my wallet. To keep up the straightening cost $ 700 every six months, and that was considered cheap.
