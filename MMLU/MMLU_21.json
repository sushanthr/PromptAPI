I got to the airport, ready to leave my work behind for a few days.       I was comfortably awaiting my flight with a good book to read, when an elderly lady was wheeled to our waiting area. I couldn't help but notice the trouble she was having trying to open a packet of nuts with her shaking hands. I sighed. No one else was willing to meet her gaze   so I offered to help.        She was very grateful. It turned out that these nuts were her entire breakfast. We sat and chatted. When the time came to board the plane the attendants   were nowhere to be seen. The lady could walk but needed some help, so I volunteered to help her on the plane and carry her bag.      As I helped her get settled I noticed her \"seat mate,\" a businessman, looked a bit horrified at having to make the fight with her. He offered to change seats with me -- and I agreed.       We landed and I needed to change planes, but I helped her disembark   first. The wheelchair she ordered was nowhere to be seen so we slowly walked to gate where her daughter was waiting.      We only exchanged first names, and she was so grateful to have my help. I had to run to catch my connection but, as I thought about the experience, I saw her as my airport angel: a chance for me to hope that in the future when I'm in my 80's and traveling, someone will take the time to connect with me. Pay it forward. Why does the author feel grateful?", "subject": ""}

But according to a new study, dogs can understand what we're thinking and feeling by reading our facial expressions and body language and following our eyes. Researchers studied 29 dogs. The dogs were shown a movie where a woman looked directly at them and said \"Hi dog!\" Then, the woman looked at a flowerpot sitting next to her. The researchers found that when the woman looked at and spoke directly to a dog, the dog usually followed her eyes to the flowerpot. It proved that the dogs knew that the woman was thinking about the flowerpot. \"By following the eye movements of dogs, we were able to get a first-hand look at how their minds are actually working,\" said Jozsef, the senior researcher. Later in the movie, the woman said \"Hi dogs\" in a low voice and didn't look at the dog before looking at the flowerpot. In that situation, the dogs didn't seem to understand what the woman was thinking. There was no eye contact, and the woman didn't appear to speak to the dogs directly. That comes as no surprise to dog trainer Jones. \"Dogs normally speak through nonverbal signals. It's more natural to them,\" she said. \"If you've ever watched dogs at a dog park, you've seen it.

Cyber Monday, the first Monday after Thanksgiving, is the online response to Black Friday, the day after Thanksgiving when stores are traditionally flooded with customers, some of whom camp at the entrances overnight to take advantage of discounts. However, in the current economic climate, online retailers have felt pressure to offer sales and discounts even before Black Friday. But how online retailers decide to offer those big savings isn't a simple matter of trying to attract the consumers who are watching their wallets, Bohlmann of Sabanci University in Istanbul says.

To test whether residents responded better to Sparky, a trained dog, or the Sony-made robotic dog, researchers divided 38 nursing home residents into three groups at three long-term care centers in St. Louis. One group had weekly 30-minute one-on-one visits with Sparky; another group had similar visits with AIBO; a control group had no contact with either dog. The groups' respective levels of loneliness were tested by having them answer a number of questions at the beginning and near the end of the visits. After two months, both groups that had contact with the dogs were less lonely and more attached. Most of the elderly regarded Sparky, a 9-year-old dog, as an audience for their life stories, said investigator Marian Banks. \"He listened attentively, wagged his tail, and allowed them to pet him,\" said Banks, who adopted and trained Sparky after finding him in a street behind her home seven years ago.

This personal connection is the necessary link between teachers and students that no amount of technology can improve upon or replace. A few years ago I had a student in sophomore English who was struggling with my class and with school in general. Although he was a humorous young man who liked to joke around, I knew his family life was far from ideal. Whenever I approached him about missing homework or low test grades, he always had the same reply, \"It doesn't matter because I'm quitting school anyway.\" Even though he always said this in a half-teasing way, I knew he needed to hear my different opinion and my \"value of a high school education\" lecture.

Researchers at the University of California have carried out the study and found that embarrassment is a good signature of a person to whom you can entrust valuable resources. Not only are the findings useful for people seeking cooperative and reliable team members and business partners, but they also make for helpful dating advice.\"Moderate  levels of embarrassment are signs of virtue. Our data suggests embarrassment is a good thing, not something you should fight.\"said Matthew Feinberg, who led the study. While the most typical gesture of embarrassment is a downward gaze to one side while partly covering the face, a person who feels shame, as distinguished  from embarrassment, will typically cover the whole face, Feinberg said. The results were got from a series of experiments. In the first experiment, 60 college students were videotaped describing embarrassing moments, such as making incorrect assumptions  based on appearances. The college students also participated in the \"Dictator Game\" which is used in economics research to measure altruism . For example, each was given 10 raffle tickets  and asked to keep a share of the tickets and give the reminder  to a partner.

With some terrific computer-generated effects, a great cast and a fun-packed storyline, Robots is the best animated film   since The Incredibles. Yep, it really is that good. Set in a world populated by robots, Ewan McGregor plays Rodney Copperbottom, a young robot who leaves his small-town home to pursue his dream of becoming an inventor. But after arriving in Robot City, his hopes of getting a job at Bigweld Industries are destroyed when he learns the firm has been taken over by the evil Ratchet (Greg Kinnear). Egged on by his controlling mum, Madame Gasket (Jim Broadbent), Ratchet plans to reduce half of Robot City's citizens to scrap metal by refusing to sell the spare parts they need to survive. Instead, he wants to make a fortune selling expensive upgrades that few can afford. As he says, \"Why be you when you can be new?\" Aided by a few misfit robots known as the Rustles--including Robin Williams as the cowardly'  Fender (\"I'm made of a metal called Afraidium\")--Rodney must track down the firm's founder, Bigweld (Mel Brooks), and convince him to save the city from Ratchet's plans. The first thing that'll strike you about the movie is the thought that's gone into creating Robot City. It's a wondrous world full of mechanical marvels including wind-up cars and walking streetlamps. Also terrific are the special effects. This might be an animated movie but at times you'll catch yourself thinking it's really a live-action film. Of course, there have been plenty of animated movies that looked the part but were let down by a weak storyline (see Shark Tale, for example). But Robots grips   right from the start thanks to a heart-warming and thoroughly engaging plot that never bores. My only complaints are with Williams who, as usual,has a one-in-10 success rate with his jokes. Also a letdown is a romantic subplot between Rodney and a shapely robot called Cappy (Halle Berry) that doesn't go anywhere. Complains aside, this is a mechanical marvel that'll have you bolted firmly to your seat.

The first thing that'll strike you about the movie is the thought that's gone into creating Robot City.

His family immigrated to the United States in 1913, after a 12-day voyage. Mark moved to New York in the autumn of 1923 and found employment in the garment trade and settled down on the Upper West Side. It was while he was visiting someone at the Art Students League that he saw students painting a model. According to him, this was the start of his life as an artist. He was twenty years old and had taken some art lessons at school, so his initial experience was far from an immediate calling. In 1936, Mark Rothko began writing a book, which he never completed, about the similarities in the children's art and the work of modern painters. The work of modernists, which was influenced by primitive art, could, according to him, be compared to that of children in that \"Child art transforms itself into primitivism, which is only the child producing a copy of himself.\" In this same work, he said that \"The fact that one usually begins with drawing is already academic. We start with colour.\" It was not long before his multiform developed into the style he is remembered for. In 1949 Rothko exhibited these new works at the Betty Parsons Gallery. For reviewer Harold Rosenberg, the paintings were unique and primitive. Rothko had, after painting his first multiform, separated himself from the world in East Hampton on Long Island, only inviting a very few people, including Rosenberg, to view the new paintings. The discovery of his works' specialty came at a period of great sorrow: his mother Kate died in October 1948. As part of this new uniformity of artistic vision, his paintings no longer had individual titles. From this point on they were simply untitled, numbered or dated. However, to assist in distinguishing one work from another, traders would sometimes add the primary colours to the name.

An experienced hunter,Alexis let her eyes lazily search for wildlife.She was shocked when a deer came into view about 200 yards in front of them.Mule deer never appeared in plain sight ten days before hunting season.It was a buck--a male deer with sharp,three-pronged antlers . Suddenly Alexis heard a scream and saw an arm fly up near the deer's head.She realized the buck was attacking a woman.Sue Panter had been Out for her morning run.The deer had appeared from the tall corn and begun following her.Having lived in the countryside of Idaho for years,Sue knew that most deer got frightened by humans.But this deer moved closer,even when she threw a handful of small stones at it. \"I knew I was in trouble,\"she says. The buck rushed forward,lifted her up with its antlers and threw her into the air. Sue could feel the antlers made small holes in her leg and blood ran down her leg.

Kenny Gibson, 23, and his friend Taron Green, 25, were driving home from a job when Rita flagged them down. Kenny stopped, and the men got out of the car and looked over the cliff. The SUV had landed upside down in five feet of water. A woman's leg could be seen swinging out the driver's side window. \"I have a fear of water,\" Kenny said now. \"I almost drowned when I was nine.\" Even so, he and Taron hurried down the 50-foot embankment into the muddy water. \"I couldn't just leave her,\" he adds. The men waded out to the car and saw that the woman, Cheryl Allison, 61, was partially in water. Kenny tried unsuccessfully to open the door. Then he broke the window. But when he reached in to pull out Cheryl, he found she was trapped by the seat belt. \"Run back to the truck and grab a box cutter ,\" Kenny yelled to Taron. Meanwhile, Kenny tried in vain to push the car onto its side to create an air pocket for Cheryl. That's when mechanic Marcell Porter approached the site. \"I flipped into rescue mode,\" he said. When Taron returned, Kenny cut through the seat belt with the box cutter. He and Marcell tried to pull Cheryl out, but she wouldn't come out. Marcell broke the rear window with a rock, hoping to rescue her from the back. Then he saw that she was still strapped in by her shoulder belt. Marcell reached for the box cutter and cut the remaining strap in two. Kenny leaned in, grabbed Cheryl by the waist, and pulled her out feet first. Marcell grasped Cheryl's legs, and they managed to drag her lifeless body onto a rock. \"Give her CPR!\" Pamela yelled down to them. But the two men had no idea what to do. \"Put your mouth on her mouth and breathe,\" she shouted to Marcell. And to Kenny, \"Pump her chest!\" \"We tried three times,\" said Marcell. Finally, Cheryl brought up water and started moving her fingers. The men rolled her over onto her stomach to let out more water. Soon an ambulance arrived and transported Cheryl to the hospital, where doctors treated her. They never discovered what caused her to pass out, but she assumes it had something to do with the burning summer heat. Over the next few days, they took turns visiting Cheryl in the hospital, where they shared hugs and tears. \"We couldn't believe she was all right,\" said Pamela. \"It's just amazing that these people came together,\" said Cheryl.

{"answer": 0, "choices": ["photophone", "optical fiber", "telephone", "laser"], "question": "Most people know Alexander Graham Bell invented the telephone. But not many know about another talking device (equipment) he invented just four years later, in 1880. He called the device the photophone. \"Photophone\" comes form the Greek words for \"light\" and \"sound\". The photophone did not use electricity to carry sound over wires between two people.  _ . Instead, the photophone used a beam of sunlight traveling through the air. With his invention, Bell could actually transmit   human speech on a beam of light. To do so, he spoke close to a thin mirror that was reflecting sunlight. The vibrations   of his voice caused the mirror to vibrate, and the vibrating mirror caused the light to vibrate. The vibrating light hit a light-sensitive cell in a receiver placed some distance away. The cell changed the light patterns into electrical signals. Earphones changed the signals back into sounds. Bell believed that his idea of talking on a beam of light would prove to be important. He often called the photophone his greatest invention. Even though the photophone depended on a source of energy that was not constant--the sun--Bell wasn't a bit discouraged. He felt sure that people would one day talk using beams of light. Two much more recent developments made Bell's dream come true. In 1960, a scientist built the laser. A laser produces a highly concentrated beam of light. Shortly afterward, other scientists developed a new kind of optical fiber. The optical fiber is a glass thread. The new fiber could carry light beams long distances--as far as several miles.

There isn't a musical instrument made by man that can produce a more beautiful sound than the song of the mockingbird. I decided that I would catch a young bird and keep it in a cage and that way have my own private musician. I finally succeeded in catching one and put it in a cage. At first, in its fright at being captured, the bird fluttered about the cage, but eventually it settled down in its new home, I felt very pleased with myself and looked forward to some beautiful singing from my tiny musician. I had left the cage out on our back porch , and on the second day of the bird's captivity my new pet's mother flew to the cage with food in her mouth . The baby bird ate everything she brought to it. I was pleased to see this. Certainly the mother knew better than I how to feed her baby.

My parents are in their late 70s, and while they are quite healthy for their ages, I worry about what messages they are going to give me. I got such an email in September from my father. He sent an email from my cousin who told that her father, my uncle Reese, had passed away.

The memorial service was set in Florida, and I quickly decided I needed to go. I needed to be there for my father, and I needed to go for myself. Reese is about nine years older than my father, and I started to do the math in my head. I know that doesn't make sense, but I will do anything to reason that I still have a lot of time before I am in my cousin's shoes. Reese's memorial service was small with only family and perhaps a dozen of his friends. The funeral was attended by an even smaller number, and then, the family gathered at a nearby bar to look at old photographs found among Reese' possessions. As we drove back to the Orlando International Airport, I thought about how I am not sure what my parents want, not only in their memorial services, but also how they want to be remembered and where they want to be laid to rest. These are going to be difficult conversations, but I know I need to have them. Maybe not right now, but we do need to open the discussion at some point.

{"answer": 2, "choices": ["1", "2", "3", "4"], "question": "A long time ago, there lived a poor man whose real name has been forgotten. He was little and old and his face was wrinkled, and that was why his friends called him Mr. Vinegar. His wife was also little and old, and they lived in a little old cottage at the back of a little old field. \"John,\" said Mrs. Vinegar, \"you must go to town and buy a cow. I will milk her and churn  butter and we shall never want for anything.\" \"That is a good plan,\" said Mr. Vinegar, so he started off to town while his wife waited by the roadside. Mr. Vinegar walked up and down the street of the town looking for a cow. After a time, a farmer came that way, leading one that was very pretty and fat. \"Oh, if I only had that cow,\" said Mr. Vinegar, \"I would be the happiest man in the world!\" \"She's a very good cow,\" said the farmer. \"Well,\" said Mr. Vinegar, \"I'll give you these 50 gold pieces for her.\" The farmer smiled and held out his hand for the money, \"You may have her,\" he said, \"I always like to oblige  , my friends!\" Mr. Vinegar took hold of the cow's halter and led her up and down the street. \"I am the luckiest man in the world,\" he said, \"for only see how all the people are looking at me and my cow!\" But at one end of the street, he met a man playing bagpipes  . He stopped and listened -- Tweedle Dee Tweedle Dee. \"Oh, that is the sweetest music I ever heard,\" he said, \"and just see how all the children crowd around the man and give him pennies! If I only had those bagpipes, I would be the happiest man in the world!!\" \"I'll sell them to you,\" said the piper. \"Will you? Well then, since I have no money, I will give you this cow for them.\" \"You may have them,\" answered the piper, \"I always like to oblige a friend.\" Mr. Vinegar took the bagpipes and the piper led the cow away. \"Now we will have some music,\" said Mr. Vinegar, but try as hard as he might, he could not play a tune. He could get nothing out of the bagpipes but \"squeak, squeak\". The children instead of giving him pennies laughed at him. The day was chilly and in trying to play the pipes, his fingers grew very cold. He wished he had kept the cow. He just started for home when he met a man who had warm gloves on his hands. \"Oh, if I only had those pretty gloves,\" he said, \"I would be the happiest man in the world.\" \"How much will you give for them?\" asked the man. \"Oh, I have no money, but I will give you these bagpipes,\" answered Mr. Vinegar. \"Well,\" said the man, \"you may have them for I always like to oblige a friend.\" Mr. Vinegar gave him the bagpipes and drew the gloves on over his half frozen fingers. \"How lucky I am,\" he said as he trudged  homeward. His hands were soon quite warm, but the road was rough and the walking hard. He was very tired when he came to the foot of the steep hill. \"How shall I ever get to the top?\" he said. Just then he met a man who was walking the other way. He had a stick in his hand which he used as a cane to help him along. \"My friend,\" said Mr. Vinegar, \"if only I had that stick of yours to help me up this hill, I would be the happiest man in the world!\" \"How much will you give me for it?\" asked the man. \"Well, I have no money, but I will give you this pair of warm gloves,\" said Mr. Vinegar. \"Well,\" said the man, \"you may have it for I always like to oblige a friend.\" Mr. Vinegar's hands were now quite warm, so he gave the gloves to the man and took the stout  stick to help him along. \"How lucky I am!'' he said as he toiled upward. At the top of the hill he stopped to rest. But as he was thinking of all his good luck that day, he heard someone calling his name. He looked up and saw only a green parrot sitting in a tree. \"Mr. Vinegar, Mr. Vinegar,\" it cried. \"What now?\" said Mr. Vinegar. \"You're a dunce  , you're a dunce!'' answered the bird, \"you went to seek your _ and you found it, then you gave it for a cow, and the cow for some bagpipes, and the bagpipes for some gloves, and the gloves for a stick which you might of cut by the roadside. He He He, you're a dunce! You're a dunce!'' This made Mr. Vinegar very angry. He threw the stick at the bird with all his might. But the bird only answered, \"You're a dunce! You're a dunce!\" And the stick lodged in the tree where he could not get it again. Mr. Vinegar went on slowly for he had many things to think about. His wife was standing by the roadside and as soon as she saw him, she cried out, \"Where's the cow? Where's the cow?\" \"Well, I just don't know where the cow is,\" said Mr. Vinegar.

I will milk her and churn  butter and we shall never want for anything.\" \"That is a good plan,\" said Mr. Vinegar, so he started off to town while his wife waited by the roadside. Mr. Vinegar walked up and down the street of the town looking for a cow. After a time, a farmer came that way, leading one that was very pretty and fat. \"Oh, if I only had that cow,\" said Mr. Vinegar, \"I would be the happiest man in the world!\" \"She's a very good cow,\" said the farmer. \"Well,\" said Mr. Vinegar, \"I'll give you these 50 gold pieces for her.\" The farmer smiled and held out his hand for the money, \"You may have her,\" he said, \"I always like to oblige  , my friends!\" Mr. Vinegar took hold of the cow's halter and led her up and down the street. \"I am the luckiest man in the world,\" he said, \"for only see how all the people are looking at me and my cow!\" But at one end of the street, he met a man playing bagpipes  . He stopped and listened -- Tweedle Dee Tweedle Dee. \"Oh, that is the sweetest music I ever heard,\" he said, \"and just see how all the children crowd around the man and give him pennies! If I only had those bagpipes, I would be the happiest man in the world!!\" \"I'll sell them to you,\" said the piper. \"Will you? Well then, since I have no money, I will give you this cow for them.\" \"You may have them,\" answered the piper, \"I always like to oblige a friend.\" Mr. Vinegar took the bagpipes and the piper led the cow away. \"Now we will have some music,\" said Mr. Vinegar, but try as hard as he might, he could not play a tune. He could get nothing out of the bagpipes but \"squeak, squeak\". The children instead of giving him pennies laughed at him. The day was chilly and in trying to play the pipes, his fingers grew very cold. He wished he had kept the cow. He just started for home when he met a man who had warm gloves on his hands. \"Oh, if I only had those pretty gloves,\" he said, \"I would be the happiest man in the world.\" \"How much will you give for them?\" asked the man. \"Oh, I have no money, but I will give you these bagpipes,\" answered Mr. Vinegar. \"Well,\" said the man, \"you may have them for I always like to oblige a friend.\" Mr. Vinegar gave him the bagpipes and drew the gloves on over his half frozen fingers. \"How lucky I am,\" he said as he trudged  homeward. His hands were soon quite warm, but the road was rough and the walking hard. He was very tired when he came to the foot of the steep hill. \"How shall I ever get to the top?\" he said. Just then he met a man who was walking the other way. He had a stick in his hand which he used as a cane to help him along. \"My friend,\" said Mr. Vinegar, \"if only I had that stick of yours to help me up this hill, I would be the happiest man in the world!\" \"How much will you give me for it?\" asked the man. \"Well, I have no money, but I will give you this pair of warm gloves,\" said Mr. Vinegar. \"Well,\" said the man, \"you may have it for I always like to oblige a friend.\" Mr. Vinegar's hands were now quite warm, so he gave the gloves to the man and took the stout  stick to help him along. \"How lucky I am!'' he said as he toiled upward. At the top of the hill he stopped to rest. But as he was thinking of all his good luck that day, he heard someone calling his name. He looked up and saw only a green parrot sitting in a tree. \"Mr. Vinegar, Mr. Vinegar,\" it cried. \"What now?\" said Mr. Vinegar. \"You're a dunce  , you're a dunce!'' answered the bird, \"you went to seek your _ and you found it, then you gave it for a cow, and the cow for some bagpipes, and the bagpipes for some gloves, and the gloves for a stick which you might of cut by the roadside. He He He, you're a dunce! You're a dunce!'' This made Mr. Vinegar very angry. He threw the stick at the bird with all his might. But the bird only answered, \"You're a dunce! You're a dunce!\" And the stick lodged in the tree where he could not get it again. Mr. Vinegar went on slowly for he had many things to think about. His wife was standing by the roadside and as soon as she saw him, she cried out, \"Where's the cow? Where's the cow?\" \"Well, I just don't know where the cow is,\" said Mr. Vinegar.

On a moonless night of April 15, 1912, the ship hit an iceberg in the North Atlantic ,with 1,500 lives lost. A century later many people presented new theories to explain the real reason for the disaster. Now two new studies argue that rare states of nature played major roles in the disaster. The first says Earth's nearness to the Moon and the Sun -- a proximity not matched in more than 1,000 years -- resulted in record tides that help explain why the Titanic met with so much ice, including the fatal iceberg. Recently, a team of researchers found an apparent explanation in the heavens.

The rare orbits took place between December 1911 and February 1912 -- about two months before the disaster came about. The researchers suggest that the high tides refloated masses of icebergs traditionally stuck along the coastlines of Labrador and Newfoundland and sent them adrift into the North Atlantic shipping lanes.

One day the woman walked upstairs and shot the drummer in the head and his girlfriend in the chest. The woman was sentenced to prison for 20 years. The dead drummer won't bother anyone with his drums, but the woman might be wishing now that she had learned to grin and bear it. If she were still living in her apartment, she could always move.

In the 1300's, English farmers hired children to protect their crops. They were called \"bird scares\". The children chased birds and threw stones at them. Bird scares were replaced in the 1800's by scarecrows. A scarecrow is anything that is set in a field to scare birds away. Often it is a pole dressed like a person. Some farms with small fields still use scarecrows today. Farming became big business in the twentieth century. Scarecrows could no longer protect the huge fields of grain, so farmers used poisonous chemicals on the fields. The poison made the grain bitter. The birds usually would not eat the bitter grain. Although they can prevent crops from being destroyed by insects and birds, some chemicals can be harmful to humans. Therefore, farmers are using fewer chemicals now than they did twenty years ago.

In parts of the Arctic, entire forests are moving northward. Across the Arctic, temperatures are rising faster than anywhere else in the world. As that happens, the tree line that marks where forests stop and the treeless tundra  starts has been shifting northward. Trees growing along the tree line must protect themselves from the cold wind. To do _ , plants tend to grow horizontal  branches low to the ground. The energy it takes for trees to grow this way means they don't have enough energy to make seeds. But as Earth's climate has been warming, trees no longer have to just grow horizontally. Many can instead grow up toward the sky. This takes less energy. And with all the leftover energy. these trees have started producing more seeds. This happens especially in places where the white spruce  grows. White spruce, which is a North American tree, is quite able to produce a lot of seeds, which can move long distances in the wind. When wind-blown seeds end up on the tundra beyond the tree line, they eventually can sprout   new trees. This explains how a forest can move. Of course, the process would work only if the tundra were warm enough. But in recent years, the whole planet has been warming. New trees will provide shelters for some snow, keeping the sun's rays from making the white surface disappear. Instead, the trees absorb the sun's heat. This warms the surrounding air. The extra warmth encourages even more trees to produce seeds. That further boosts a forest's ability to expand. In addition, more trees will trap more snow, preventing much of it from being blown away. Snow can trap heat in the soil below,which encourages trees to grow. The recent rise of temperature has helped more trees grow.  The recent rise of temperatures has helped more trees grow past the tree line.

Everyone knew it was the most expensive, the most famous of schools. You had to be entered at birth, if not before. Besides, even at 12 or 13, I. understood my father. He disliked any form of showing off. He always knew his proper station in life, which was in the middle of the middle class; our house was medium-sized; he had avoided joining Royal Liverpool Golf Club and went to a smaller one instead; though once  he had got a second-hand Rolls-Royce at a remarkably low price, he felt embarrassed driving it, and quickly changed it for an Austin 1100.       This could only be his delightful way of telling me that the whole boarding school idea was to be dropped. Alas ! I should also have remembered that he had a liking for being different from everyone else, if it did not conflict with his fear of drawing attention to himself.       It seemed that he had happened to be talking to Graham Brown of the London office, a very nice fellow, and Craham had a friend who had just entered his boy at the school, and while he was in that part of the world he thought he might just as well phone them.

That is the reason why Mrs Bennet, the mother of the five girls, is so eager to have her daughters married.

More than 1,000 of those children were not wearing seat belts. If they had been wearing seat belts, 500 of those children could be alive today. These children are too old to be in car seats, but they often sit in the back seat. Seat belt laws in many states, including Wisconsin, only require people in the front seat to wear seat belts. Children who aren't wearing seat belts can be thrown from the car. The risk of dying in an accident is three times greater if the person is thrown from the car. New laws could require children aged 4 to 8 to be in booster seats in the car. Booster seats help seat belts fit children properly. Right now, only 5 percent of children aged 4 to 8 are seated in booster seats. While parents have the choice of whether wearing seat belts or not, children are too young to make that choice. Even if you decide not to wear a seat belt, make sure you children are in seat belts and car seats. It's the law and it will save their lives.

The selection of Doris Lessing for a Nobel was popular among the hundreds of journalists gathered for the announcement in Stockholm. Permanent Secretary of the Swedish Academy Horace Engdahl said with skepticism, fire and visionary power Lessing has subjected a divided civilization to scrutiny. Doris Lessing was born in 1919 in Persia - modern-day Iran - to British parents, moving as a child with her family to southern Rhodesia, now Zimbabwe, where she stayed in school only to the age of 14. A year after moving to London, she published her first novel in 1950.The Grass is Singingexamines unbridgeable racial conflict in colonial Africa through the eyes of a white farmer's wife and her black servant. A member of the British Communist Party during the 1950s and a campaigner against nuclear arms and South African apartheid, Lessing was for years banned from that country and from Rhodesia. Her literary breakthrough came in 1962 with publication ofThe Golden Notebook, seen by many, though not necessarily Lessing, as a pioneering work of modern feminism. A disjointed study of the mind of the main character, Anna Wulf, the novel explores her thoughts about Africa, politics and communism, relationships with men and sex, and Jungian analysis and dream interpretation. Lessing's themes shifted to psychology in her works from the 1960s, and by the 1970s she was fascinated with the Islamic mystic tradition of Sufism. Her turn toward science fiction withthe Canopusseries in the early 1980s was not warmly received by traditionalist critics, but she has continued to win new readers and numerous literary awards, including the David Cohen British Literary Prize and the Companion of Honour from the Royal Society of Literature, both in 2001. Following the announcement, the Horace Engdahl told VOA why he was personally so pleased with Lessing's selection. \"She is one of the truly great writers - of novels, short stories, fiction and non-fiction,\" Engdahl said. \"She is one of the few writers who have had the courage to uphold the principle of equality between the male and female experience, and she has given the impulse to numbers of other women writers.

{"answer": 1, "choices": ["write our own stories", "learn our own history", "understand the importance of history", "have a proper attitude towards history"], "question": "Understanding one's own history is important for young people's learning and development. Students are often asked to write a story about their own family's history or about a special person in their family. But too rarely do students focus on the history of their own community or their own people, in a way that helps them to understand why they find themselves in a particular situation. When people understand their own history, they are able to _ the influence of the social structures that sometimes limit the possibilities in their lives. Taking this approach opens the door for young people to be managers of their own learning and development as they understand why they find themselves where they are. , Many people I have been talking to about this issue agree that not only schools but also public bodies and families have failed to educate young people about their own history. And I know from my own experience how difficult it was for my father to talk about his family's experience in 1944.This may be a reflection of the sadness that people feel about that history and not wanting to make it a burden on their young people. But in today's situation, those I spoke with now clearly see that as a mistake. If our society is ever to find a way to properly deal with the influence of our own history, including what has happened to our Native American, African-American and Latino friends, our schools must step up to help young people understand their own stories. Families and related social bodies must do the same. The passage mainly encourages us to  _  .", "subject": ""}

Unfortunately, the more industrialized we become, the farther away we move from direct contact with plants, and the less distinct our knowledge grows.Yet everyone comes unconsciously on an amazing amount of botanical knowledge, and few people will fail to recognize a rose or an apple.When nor Neolithic ancestors, living in the Middle East about 10,000 years ago, discovered that certain grasses could be harvested and their seeds planted for richer fields the next season--the first, great step in a new association of plants and humans was taken.Grains were discovered and from them flowed the wonder of agriculture: cultivated crops.From then on, humans would increasingly take their living from the controlled production of a few plants, rather than getting a little here and a little there from many varieties that grew wild, and the accumulated knowledge of tens of thousands of years of experience with plants in the wild would begin to fade away. Human would depend on the controlled production of a few plants for living with", "subject": ""}

{"answer": 3, "choices": ["It's cold all the year round.", "It's hot in summer.", "The climate is very comfortable.", "It depends on where your are in Siberia."], "question": "Siberia is a huge territory in Russia. It is more than half of Russia and is 4,000 miles wide.  Most of this area is a forest with animals and birds. In autumn, the forests in Siberia are full of mushrooms and berries . Many people like picking mushrooms, but that is not as simple as you might think. Old people who live in the villages know places where you can pick lots of mushrooms. Some mushrooms grow in colonies. If you find one, you only need to look around because nearby you'll find more of them. However, when picking mushrooms, it is important not to choose the wrong kind. You have to be careful because some mushrooms are poisonous even though they look good. The smell can help you choose them, because good mushrooms smell very good. Siberian people are very friendly and hospitable. If someone invites you home for dinner, you'll soon be full. You should try everything the host is having. The climate there depends on the territory. Some places have very comfortable climates with hot summers and cold winters. In my opinion, the best season is spring, when nature wakes up after a long winter. It is the time for blossoms and love. Birds come back from other warm countries. Trees become dressed in green. The sun becomes warm and the days are longer. The mood is wonderful and people smile a lot. It is an amazing time. In winter, you have opportunity for sports. The most popular sport in winter in Russia is cross-country skiing. During weekends, many people go into the country and ski. Noses freeze and cheeks hurt, but people continue to enjoy these times.

By the 1700's doctors began to say that soap and water were good for health. They believed that it was good for people to be clean. Slowly, people began to bathe more frequently. During the Victorian Age of the late 19th century, taking a bath on Saturday night became common. In the United States ordinary bathing was slow to become popular. During the 18th and early 19th centuries, many Americans were known as \"The Great Unwashed!\" In one American city, for example, a person was only allowed to take a bathe every thirty days! That was a law! Frequency of bathing today is partly a matter of habit. People know that bathing for cleanliness is important to health, Doctors know that dirty bodies increase the chance of diseases. As a result, in the United States, people generally bathe often. Some people bath once a day at least. They consider a daily bath essential (=\"necessary)\" to good health. Which of the following gives the main idea of the passage?", "subject": ""}
{"answer": 1, "choices": ["getting too old", "hardly using your brain", "working too hard", "using your brain too much"], "question": "Man still has a lot to learn about the most powerful and complex part of his body -- the brain. It may be surprising to learn that it isn't age that makes you lose your memory. The reason could be that you have a \"lazy\" memory, not an old one. Like your body your memory improves with exercise. Once given plenty of exercise, the brain keeps its power. Before discussing how to improve the memory, let's look at how the brain works. There are two sides to the brain, the left and the right. The right side deals with the senses (what we see, hear, feel and smell). It's the creative and imaginative side. The left side is concerned with logic. It analyzes information and puts it in order. Some recent research suggests that we remember everything that happens to us. The problem most of us has is recalling events. Most forgetting takes place immediately after learning. An hour after learning something new, more than 50% has been forgotten. After a month, 80% has been forgotten, and so on. This shows revision is very important. If you revise new material you have learnt, you remember much more. So it's of vital importance to revise newly learned material often, and have frequent breaks. We best remember what we learn at the beginning of a learning period and at the point where we stop. After the break, revise what was learned before the break and then continue learning the new material. These breaks should happen every 20 or 45 minutes. Other experiments have shown the brain needs time to \"digest\" what has been learned. The time necessary for this is 5 to 10 minutes. After the break, the memory will have absorbed what it has just learned, and more will be remembered. During this period it is important to exercise the right side of the brain, because the left side is used during the learning period. Therefore you should relax. Listening to music, breathing in fresh air, and looking at a picture are all ways of using the other side of the brain.

Via Line 10, transfer to Line 8 at Beitucheng station to reach the Olympic central zone, where the \"Bird's Nest\" and other venues are located; transfer to Line 5 at Huixinxijie Nankou; transfer to Line 13 at Zhichunlu and Shaoyaoju stations; Sanyuanqiao station takes you to the airport via the Airport Line.  From subway to bus Beijing's subway system is thoroughly linked with bus routes. The Beijing Railway Station, which can be reached via the Line 2 subway, has bus lines going north, southeast and to the West Railway Station, covering Chaoyang, Tongzhou, Daxing and other districts. Xizhimen station is linked to many bus routes that go south and northeast. The long-distance bus routes near Dongzhimen station pass through Shunyi, Pinggu and other outskirts.  Park and ride Park and ride facilities allow commuters to leave their personal vehicles in a parking lot and transfer to a bus or rail system. In Beijing, because of city planning and other factors, park and ride is limited to bus and subway stations beyond the Fourth Ring Road. Since the Line 5 subway began operating, a low-fare parking lot, the largest in Beijing, was created at Tiantongyuan Beizhan station. Drivers are encouraged to spend just two yuan per day parking their vehicles and take the subway into the city. What is the purpose of the tips?", "subject": ""}

{"answer": 0, "choices": ["New Hope for Elephants.", "Elephants are dying.", "Elephants are valuable.", "How to protect elephants"], "question": "The illegal ivory trade has been a major problem in Africa for decades. Poachers  and hunters have killed off hundreds of thousands of elephants to obtain this precious material. Now, affected areas are taking action. The International Union for Conservation of Nature (IUCN) announced on Wednesday that key states where poaching takes place have promised to stop the ivory trade and protect Africa's elephants. In the 1980s, as many as 1 million elephants across Africa were killed for their ivory tusks. This continued until 1989, when the Convention on International Trade in Species (CITES) voted to ban all trade in ivory. With trade , demand for ivory fell. Elephant populations slowly began to increase. However, this progress was short-lived. According to the IUCN, 2011 saw the highest levels of poaching and illegal ivory trading in at least 16 years. Around 25,000 elephants were killed in Africa that year. Preliminary data from the IUCN shows even higher levels of illegal trade may have been reached in 2013. \"With about 22,000 elephants illegally killed in 2012, we continue to face a critical situation,\" said John E. Scanlon, CITES Secretary-General. \"Current elephant poaching in Africa remains far too high, and could soon lead to local extinctions if the present killing rate continues.\" At the African Elephant Summit, key African states where elephants make their home agreed to develop a \"zero-tolerance attitude\" towards poaching. The deal calls for maximum sentences for poachers and hunters, and increased cooperation between affected states. Officials are determined to classifying wildlife trading as a serious crime -- and to making sure that the people who commit it are punished. All participants at the conference agreed to sign the deal. With these states coming together, there may yet be hope for elephants.

Similar findings were seen in participants aged 45 to 65 years,\" Helfrich's team added in their report.

She used a special camera that produced square shaped images. One art expert said Diane Arbus turned photography inside out. Instead of looking at her subjects, she made them look at her. Diane Arbus was born in 1923 to a wealthy family in New York City. After finishing high school at the age of 18, Diane married Allan Arbus. Mr. Arbus worked in the advertising department of her father's store. It was Mr. Arbus who gave Diane her first camera. Diane soon decided to take a class with the famous photographer Berenice Abbott. The Arbuses eventually started taking photographs of clothing. These images were used as advertisements for Diane's father's store. After the birth of their daughter, Doon, the Arbuses started a business together. Their purpose was to photograph clothing fashions. Diane Arbus was the stylist. She would prepare the hair and faces of the fashion models who wore the clothing being photographed. Allan Arbus took the pictures. The couple soon had jobs from important fashion magazines such as \"Vogue\" and \"Harper's Bazaar\". Their work was very successful during the 1950s. They became part of a group of artists that were helping to redefine visual culture. They were breaking with past traditions to create a new look for a new decade, the sixties.

Now that your children are in middle school, it's time to think about paying them to do something. My daughter missed a lot of school when she was a junior so I promised to buy her a notebook computer if she didn't miss any school as a senior -- she got the computer finally. What worked for my other daughter was a clothing allowance for her joining in the housework. She would receive a set amount every two months; it taught her a valuable lesson: when the clothing money ran out, she couldn't buy more clothes until she got enough money through doing the housework. \"I need more allowance,\" should be the start, not the end, of a dialogue. Grace wanted to tell Mom, \"Only buy what we need.\" Spending wisely and saving money was a good theme from all the students. The idea of thinking carefully about spending is just what I taught them at class, but this is not the subject of this Junior Achievement course. It shows me that these teenagers look at their parents' spending habits, but they don't tell their parents their opinions about them. Therefore, Moms and Dads, pay attention and remember: your children watch everything you do when it comes to money -- do it right, point them in the right direction. Nikola's advice is valuable to all parents -- \"Mom and Dad, I think I should be more involved in money and financial   things so I know how to do everything without a struggle when I get older.\" This child has got it right.

She would receive a set amount every two months; it taught her a valuable lesson: when the clothing money ran out, she couldn't buy more clothes until she got enough money through doing the housework. \"I need more allowance,\" should be the start, not the end, of a dialogue. Grace wanted to tell Mom, \"Only buy what we need.\" Spending wisely and saving money was a good theme from all the students. The idea of thinking carefully about spending is just what I taught them at class, but this is not the subject of this Junior Achievement course. It shows me that these teenagers look at their parents' spending habits, but they don't tell their parents their opinions about them. Therefore, Moms and Dads, pay attention and remember: your children watch everything you do when it comes to money -- do it right, point them in the right direction. Nikola's advice is valuable to all parents -- \"Mom and Dad, I think I should be more involved in money and financial   things so I know how to do everything without a struggle when I get older.\" This child has got it right.

Few people could avoid getting caught up in his feelings. This is the appeal of country music, which speaks to the basic emotions of human life. Throughout the 20th century, it has grown into one of the most original and lasting American musical forms. Country music's roots are in the songs of the American South, brought over by early immigrants  from England. Those songs expressed the hardships of rural life and deep religious beliefs. In the 1920s, country music came into being as its first recordings were made. Early stars like Jimmy Rodger, known as \"The Father of Country Music\", and the Carter Family established its strong traditions - good song-writing, singing and playing. Much of this music was written for and brought to the American public through the cowboy films of the 1930s and 1940s. It was widely popular then and many singers turned up on stage wearing Western fringe and cowboy hats. In the 1950s, the country music recording industry was set up in Nashville and moved away from its rough roots. But singers like John Denver, with his hit track \"Take Me Home, Country Roads\", insisted on the originality and emotions of \"real\" country music.

The result was that readers ranked MEXICA stories highest for flow and coherence, structure, content, suspense and overall quality. Rafael Perezy Perez, the creator of MEXICA, explained that a story might begin with something as basic as, \"The enemy wounded the knight. The princess cured the knight. The knight killed the enemy.

The program also understands story tension, such as linking the word \"wounded\" with tension. This too is assigned a numerical value.

He was the creator of The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy(<<>> ), which started life as a BBC Radio 4 series in March 1978. Since then it has been transformed into a series of best-selling novels, a TV series, a record album, a computer game and several stage adaptations. The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy's success sent the book straight to Number One in the UK Bestseller List and in 1984 Douglas Adams became the youngest author to be awarded a Golden Pan. He won a further two (a rare feat), and was nominated--though not selected - for the first Best of Young British Novelists awards. He followed this success with The Restaurant at the End of the Universe (1980); Life, The Universe and Everything (1982); So Long and Thanks for all the Fish (1984); and Mostly Harmless (1992). The first two books in the Hitchhiker series were adapted into a 6-part television series, which was an immediate success when first showed in 1982. Other publications include Dirk Gently's Holistic Detective Agency (1987) and Long Dark Tea-time of the Soul (1988). In 1984 Douglas teamed up with John Lloyd and wrote The Meaning of Life and their second huge success, The Deeper Meaning of Life followed in 1990. One of Douglas's personal favorites was written in 1990 when he teamed up with zoologist Mark Carwardine and wrote Last Chance to See an account of a world-wide search for rare and endangered species of animals.

The finding helps to explain why people enjoy listening to sad music, say Ai Kawakami and her colleagues from Tokyo University of the Arts and the RIKEN Brain Science Institute, Japan. Ai Kawakami and her colleagues asked 44 volunteers, including both musicians and nonspecialists, to listen to two pieces of sad music and one piece of happy music. Each participant was required to use a set of keywords to rate both their perception  of the music and their own emotional state. The sad pieces of music included Glinka's La Separation in F minor and Blumenfeld's Etude Sur Mer in G minor. The happy music piece was Granados's Allegro de Concierto in G major. To control the \"happy\" effect of major key, they also played the minor key  pieces in major key, and vise versa. The researchers explained that sad music aroused contradictory emotions because the participants of the study tended to feel sad to be more tragic and less romantic than they felt themselves while listening to it. \" In general, sad music causes sadness in listeners, and sadness is regarded as an unpleasant emotion. If sad music actually arouses only unpleasant emotion, we would not listen to it,\" the researchers wrote in the study. \"Music that is believed as sad actually causes romantic emotion as well as sad emotion.And people, regardless of their musical training, experience this ambivalent  emotion to listen to the sad music,\" added the researchers. Also, unlike sadness in daily life, sadness experienced through art actually feels pleasant, possibly because the latter does not cause an actual threat to our safety.

The better a student's eating habits based on several measures of diet quality,including adequacy and variety, the less likely he or she was to have failed the test, the researchers found,even after they adjusted the data for the effects of parental income and education, school and sex.Eating plenty of fruit and vegetables, and getting fewer calories from fat, was also associated with a lower risk of failing the test. To date, Veugelers and his team say, most research on diet and school performance has focused on the importance of eating breakfast, as well as the ill effects of hunger and malnutrition . \"This study extends current knowledge in this area by demonstrating the independent importance of overall diet quality to academic performance.We should not only realize the importance of children's nutrition at breakfast but also that throughout the day,\" the researchers conclude. Another research from the UK is suggesting that children's diets in the preschool years affects how they perform at school later on.The researchers from the Institute of Education, at the University of London say in fact that what children were eating in those days before primary school has more of an effect than the chicken nuggets  they ate at lunchtime.The researchers say they have found that children who ate a diet of \"junk food\" at the age of three, made less progress in school between the ages of six and ten.They say children's diet at later ages appears to have less impact on their school attainment. .Which of the following statements is TRUE?", "subject": ""}

The dormitory is bringing new meaning to the concept of living \"green\" at college. At Warren Wilson College, a biological science school with fewer than 1,000 students, the sustainability drive came from the student body. The EcoDorm concept was presented ten years ago by two students; a planning committee firstly suggested using building materials like corncob. Although the architects disagreed with the idea, they came up with other creative solutions: Wood siding was taken from the trees grown in the school yard that were suffering from a disease, and rainwater was collected in an old railway car and pumped back into the house to clean the toilets. All in all, the dorm uses nearly two-thirds less electricity than a similar-sized traditional building world. But even the most sustainable homes need continued efforts from its livers. And in the case of EcoDorm, students live by their words.

Although the architects disagreed with the idea, they came up with other creative solutions: Wood siding was taken from the trees grown in the school yard that were suffering from a disease, and rainwater was collected in an old railway car and pumped back into the house to clean the toilets. All in all, the dorm uses nearly two-thirds less electricity than a similar-sized traditional building world. But even the most sustainable homes need continued efforts from its livers. And in the case of EcoDorm, students live by their words. Most also take advantage of the dorm's bio-garden, planting and harvesting fruits and vegetables. \"I didn't have to worry about paper towels being wasted or feel bad about drying my clothes outside,\" Jeremy Lekich, the dorm's gardener, said. \"Basically, it has made my life easier.\" What is the advantage of the EcoDorm?", "subject": ""}

They believe the plan is part of an effort to restart commercial whaling activities. Such activities are banned in many countries. South Korea announced the proposal in July at a meeting of the International Whaling Commission in Panama. The head of the South Korean delegation   said the plan was needed to answer questions about minke whale populations. He said the hunt would take place near the South Korean coast. But he did not say how many of the animals would be caught. The International Whaling Commission has yet to make a decision on the South Korean plan. The organization banned commercial whaling in 1986 because of concerns about the survival of whale species. But now, some South Korean fishermen say they are facing a threat from minke whales. They say these animals are eating what would have been their catch. The plan was immediately condemned by anti-whaling nations. Wildlife activists also criticized the proposal. Han Jeong-hee works in Seoul for the environmental group Greenpeace.\"It's really regretful to hear that the South Korean government is, like, considering conducting scientific whaling. Scientific whaling is just, like, thinly disguised commercial whaling. And, you know, we are of course against all commercial whaling. Japan's the only country that is doing scientific whaling at the moment and South Korea is just trying to follow that.\" Apart from the plan in South Korea, an aquarium   in the American state of Georgia also wants to import eighteen beluga whales from Russia. The United States currently has 31 beluga whales. They are living in six aquariums and marine parks. Four of them are at the Georgia Aquarium in Atlanta. The Georgia Aquarium has asked the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA) for permission to import the beluga whales. If it was approved, aquarium officials would send some of the animals to the other facilities. The Georgia Aquarium says it hopes to use the beluga whales in research, education and breeding programs. They currently are being held at a Russian research center. Yet many people oppose the plan. They say it is wrong to catch any wild animal. NOAA officials are studying how the beluga whales might be affected by being brought to the United States. They also want to know whether the Georgia Aquarium and its partners can properly care for the whales and how they might be used in educational activities. The federal Marine Mammal Protection Act sets rules which NOAA must consider when deciding whether these animals may be imported. NOAA officials told VOA they plan to make a decision on the request by early next year. What's Han Jeong-hee's attitude toward South Korea's proposal of doing scientific whaling?", "subject": ""}

In the study \"The Children We Mean to Raise: The Real Message Adults Are Sending about Values\", the authors refer to a reality gap, an incongruity   between what adults tell children they should value and the message we grown-ups actually send through our behavior. Simply talking about sympathy is not enough. While 96 percent of parents say they want to raise caring children, and cite the development of moral character as \"very important, if not essential\", 80 percent of the youths surveyed reported that their parents \"are more concerned about achievement and happiness than caring about others\". Approximately the same percentage of the students reported that their teachers put their achievement over caring. As the report shows, simply talking about sympathy is not enough. Children are sensitive creatures, fully capable of telling the true meanings in the blank spaces between well-organised words. If parents really want to let their kids know that they value care and sympathy, the authors suggest, they must make a real effort to help their children learn to care about other people--even when it's hard, even when it does not make them happy, and yes, even when it is at odds with their personal success. What can be concluded from the study?", "subject": ""}

It tells the news through people, and for many decades, the magazine's cover depicted a single person. On Hadden's death in 1929, Luce became the most important man at TIME and a major figure in the history of 20th-century media.

A young woman was stepped on in a stampede   at the train station Friday, and later died of her injuries, according to Xinhua. Video of the situation on Friday showed crowds of people screaming, elbowing each other, in some cases sobbing and collapsing in the rush to get a slot (,) on a train. China Sunday announced it has organized over 300,000 People's Liberation Army forces to southern China in what it described as a \"war on winter weather\". The government also announced a $700 million plan to help farmers whose crops have been destroyed. Where is Hong Tao from?", "subject": ""}

{"answer": 1, "choices": ["He used to work as a fireman.", "He has determination and strong will-power.", "He learnt running from a coach.", "He was advised to ride a bike when he was badly burnt."], "question": "Why do people run? That is, why do thousands get up early and put their knees and ankles and hearts and lungs through the hell of 10,000 meters on the roads? For those who stick with it and are lucky, they get into another world: a state of physical and mental grace reached when their blood is racing through every vein  . And in Austin, those who long to get better, even when they know it's impossible, hang on Gilbert's every word. Gilbert's methods are simple. It's all about form: how the arms move and the feet land. He pushes his students hard. When they feel like they're about to die, they look at Gilbert's scars   -- the burns along his right arm, and then to his right leg, where the flames ate down to the bone. Whatever they feel, how bad, really, could it be? \"He gets people to believe in themselves,\" says Lisa Spenner, one of the _ , who are crazy about Gilbert. \"He treats everyone like they're amazing.\" If Gilbert is their savior, they are his saviors too. \"Eventually, I realized I had to help people. When I help people, I feel good,\" he says. Gilbert's right leg was so badly burnt that the knee was stuck at a 90-degree angle. The doctor said it would take six months to heal. Frustrated, Gilbert got on a bike. The biking led to walking, which finally led to running a year after he had been left to die. In truth, runners don't race other runners. They race against themselves to conquer their wills. So Gilbert spent the spring and summer of 2007 trying to do that, racing men faster than he is, knowing it would make him better. Gilbert's students, of course, keep rooting for him, though sometimes they wonder, \"How much better can he get?\" After all, they see him as more than just a runner and a coach. He's a flesh-and-blood symbol: the daily struggle to show what you're made of. What do we learn about Gilbert after reading the passage?", "subject": ""}

This is the busiest time when workers care for and raise all the little ones before sending them back into the wild. There are many reasons for these little animals' coming to the center. First of all, street cats or dogs catch, injure or take away little birds from their nests. Sometimes people catch baby animals and keep them at home, giving them food that they are not used to. It would make them sick. Most people don't realize that it's against law to get live animals out of their nests. As for songbirds, people often find them on the ground in their yards, thinking they have no other choice but to leave them on the ground to die. This is because many people wrongly believe that once a bird is touched by a person, its mother will not accept this child bird. But that's not true. If a little bird falls out of the nest, you should check whether it is injured. If not, you should put the bird back in the nest. If the bird is injured, call your local wildlife center quickly. As for the progress of protecting wild animals, people at Wild Friends devote all their energy to this work. Over the last weeks, they have been able to send many of the birds and rabbits that came here earlier this spring back to nature.

It was the second wave of violent weather to hit the state in less than a week. Last weekend, tornadoes killed 24 people in the western part of the state and destroyed more than 1,000 homes and buildings. The storms crossed an area from northern Mississippi to northern Virginia as they moved to the northeast late Friday after developing from a low-pressure system in the central Plains. The Nashville suburbs were the hardest hit, with at least eight deaths happening northeast of the city. Three more people were killed in a rural area about 65 miles southeast of Nashville. Tornadoes were also reported in some other places. The storms pulled up trees, knocked down power lines and damaged buildings. What's worse, phone lines and most businesses were out of service. Hospitals admitted at least 60 people with storm-related injuries and transferred at least nine badly injured patients to Nashville hospitals. In southern Indiana, the storms damaged some areas with golf ball-sized hail. High winds blew the roof off a country club and overthrew a semitrailer . As the storms moved farther east, parts of West Virginia were lashed with heavy rain and winds, great damages caused.

Rosie is only about 10 inches long when her legs are stretched to their full length. She can jump more than 25 times her size. Rosie, the frog, wins the long-jump event. The next event is the high jump. Javier Sotomayor, the world record holder, can jump a bar   8 feet high. That is about as high as the ceiling in most homes. Looking around for someone to challenge his record, Javier might need a magnifying glass  . The next _ is a tiny insect called the spittlebug  . The spittlebug can jump 28 inches into the air. It is only a quarter-inch long, less than the width of a pencil. If the spittlebug were the same size as Javier, it would be able to jump 600 feet into the air. That is like a human jumping over a building 55 stories high! Though the humans lose the \"jumping contest,\" their competitors would probably agree that Mike and Javier are still pretty excellent athletes. If only Rosie and the spittlebug could speak!

On January 24th, 1848, a man named James Wilson Marshall discovered gold in California. The news spread quickly. Thousands rushed west. They traveled on foot, on horseback and by boat to reach the gold fields. By 1849, the great gold rush was on. Towns and cities grew overnight. Throughout California --- in the mountains, along the streams and rivers --- thousands of people searched for gold. Some found areas of mountain rock thick with gold. These men got rich. But such areas were few and quickly claimed by the first men to find them. Others searched for gold in the rivers coming down the mountains. They were after pieces of gold that the rains had washed down from above . The only way to find this gold was by panning. First a gold miner put dirt in a metal pan and added water. Then he shook the pan so that the water would wash the dirt. Slowly, he poured the water out of the pan. If he was a lucky miner, pieces of gold would remain. Across the nation, newspapers carried stories of the gold being found. Each one hoped that the place he claimed panned out well --- had some gold. For many, gold mining did not pan out. For a few, it panned out well. But in time, huge machines were built that could wash many tons of dirt at a time. Panning died out. The word, however, remained in the language. Today, Americans still say, \" It panned out well ,\" when something they have done pleases them. A business, a discovery, a simple event pans out well if it is successful. Unhappily, sometimes things do not pan out. In recent years, the word pan has taken on another meaning. Today, it also means to criticize. How it got this meaning is hard to discover.

Now thanks to a fiveyear effort by scientists, the terribly silent \"Rat Island\" as it had been called for many years has been returned to its rightful owners ----birds! Hawadax Island is part of a chain of volcanic islands in the Bering Sea called the Aleutian Islands. The rats that arrived there in 1780, when a Japanese ship carrying them broke down nearby, completely destroyed the native population because the environment of the island was not built to defend its animals from these predators. There isn't any tree on the Island, which meant that the birds were accustomed to building their nests low in the ground, giving the rodents  easy access to both eggs and baby chicks. As years passed, the birds that had called the island home for thousands of years became endangered and eventually, disappeared completely. In 2007, the U.S. FWS (Fish and Wildlife Service) started a serious plan to rid the island of the rats and try bringing back the beautiful birds that had once called it home. Given that there were an estimated 10,000 rodents inhabiting \"Rat Island\" and the fact that they reproduce rapidly, it was not an easy task. But by 2009, the Island was officially declared rat free! Then slowly but surely, the birds began to return. Unfortunately, some of the pioneers were unintentionally killed from the leavings of the raticide, a poison that had been used to wipe out the rodents. But now it seems things are becoming more stable and the Island is starting to increasingly look like its former self. Before the transformation, \"Hawadax\", also known as \"Rat Island\", was a silent and ghostly place with bird bones, snail remains and rocks covered in rat feces .

As years passed, the birds that had called the island home for thousands of years became endangered and eventually, disappeared completely. In 2007, the U.S. FWS (Fish and Wildlife Service) started a serious plan to rid the island of the rats and try bringing back the beautiful birds that had once called it home. Given that there were an estimated 10,000 rodents inhabiting \"Rat Island\" and the fact that they reproduce rapidly, it was not an easy task. But by 2009, the Island was officially declared rat free! Then slowly but surely, the birds began to return. Unfortunately, some of the pioneers were unintentionally killed from the leavings of the raticide, a poison that had been used to wipe out the rodents. But now it seems things are becoming more stable and the Island is starting to increasingly look like its former self. Before the transformation, \"Hawadax\", also known as \"Rat Island\", was a silent and ghostly place with bird bones, snail remains and rocks covered in rat feces . Today, birds' singing and flying in and out is a common sight. Tufted puffins and song sparrows, which had long disappeared, are gradually making their way back.

All these structures use electricity and need to be lighted. Humans demand these lights. They want their homes more comfortable and they want their streets safe. The problem is that researchers are finding that all the light is having a negative effect on humans and wildlife as well. Less than 10 years ago I drove to a thinly populated section of my town, lay down in the middle of the road and watched an attractive meteor shower  . The area was short of homes, street lights and traffic. If I did that today, I wouldn't be able to see the meteor shower as well. Due to the increase in street lights, I would surely be run over by a car. Nowadays scientists are finding light pollution can be almost as bad as carbon dioxide pollution. If you've ever taken a flight at night, the view is beautiful, but you must remember that all the light you see wastes electricity. The crew of the space shuttles see an even bigger picture of how extensive the wasted electricity is worldwide. One of the saddest parts of light pollution is that most of it is unnecessary and most of the outdoor light that we use is wasted. One only needs to look at a row of street lights to see how much of the light shines upwards and lights the sky; a total waste of electricity. Additionally, somewhere electricity needs to be produced, and the production of electricity creates pollution by releasing greenhouse gases. This affects the air we breathe and our quality of life. Scientists are also studying the effects of light pollution on wildlife. Thousands of birds die each year when they crash into highly lighted buildings, as they become puzzled by the light. It has been long known that tiny baby sea turtles become lost and follow lights on the shore instead of heading towards the sea.

Money was tight that year and Toby's parents had told him they would not be able to afford a holiday. Instead of dreaming about foreign travel, he had been reading a book, Letter to New Zealand, where the author explains what happens in an envelope's journey from England to the other side of the world. As they neared their house, Toby asked his mum, Sabine, if he could write a letter to New Zealand. After a few more steps he was struck by an even better idea. \"Can I write a letter to every country in the world?\" Sabine says she often wonders what would have happened if she had replied differently that day. \"It was just one of those typical questions that five-year-olds have,\" she says. \" If he had asked me in the evening when I was tired, I might have refused.

{"answer": 1, "choices": ["the research findings are practical in indoor decoration", "solid evidence is inadequate to prove how colors affect us", "a larger study may help confirm colors' effects on our behaviors", "walls should be painted different colors depending on different tasks"], "question": "We might think we know which colours do what.The idea that red wakes us up or blue calms us down is deeply rooted in Western culture.But do they really change our behaviour in the ways that we assume? When it comes to scientific research, the results are mixed and at times contested.Some studies have found that people do better on cognitive tasks when faced with red rather than blue or green; others show the opposite.The idea is that if you repeatedly have a particular experience surrounded by a certain colour, then you eventually begin to associate that colour with the way you were feeling or behaving.A school career spent reading your teacher's red writing circling your mistakes forever makes you link red with danger.Blue meanwhile is more likely to be associated with calmer situations like marvelling at a big blue expanse of sky. Of course there will always be exceptions --- the comment from the teacher saying \"well done\" is also written in red.It is true that people do make different associations with different colours, but whether this translates into behaving in a certain way or succeeding at a particular task is a different question. In 2009 researchers tried to clarify the situation.They sat their participants at computer screens colored blue, red or \"neutral\" and tested them on various tasks.With a red screen people did better on tasks requiring attention to detail, but when the screen was blue they did better on creative tasks.In practice this might be tricky.In a classroom you might want to think creatively some of the time and pay attention to detail at others. However, when another team tried to repeat the study with a larger group of people in 2014, the effect of color disappeared.The initial study consisted of just 69 people.In this new, bigger study, of 263 volunteers, background color made no difference. So colors might well have an effect, but so far those effects have been difficult to demonstrate consistently and sometimes don't seem to exist at all. It can be concluded from the results of the studies in 2009 and 2014 that   _  .", "subject": ""}

For the next eight hours I wanted to throw myself into helping people who I knew had much more to worry about than I did. Rebekah, mother of three lovely little girls, was only 32, admitted for chemotherapy after breast-cancer surgery, When I gave her an injection, Rebekah shut her eyes tightly and murmured a prayer until it was over. Then she smiled and squeezed my hand. \"Before you go, could you get my Bible from the table?\" I handed her the worn book. \"Do you have a favorite Bible verse?\" she asked. \"Jesus wept.

During the following months, her hospital stays became frequent and she worried about her children. One day when I entered her room, I found her talking into a tape recorder. She picked up a notebook and held it out to me. \"I'm making a tape for my daughters, \" she said. I read the list on her pad: starting school, confirmation, turning 16, first date, graduation. While I worried how to help her deal with death, she was planning for her children's future. She usually waited until the early hours of the morning to record the tapes so she could be free from interruptions. She filled them with family stories and advice,trying to cram a lifetime of love into a few precious hours. Finally, every item in her notes had been checked off and she entrusted the tapes to her husband. I often wondered what I would say in her place. My kids joked that I was like an FBI agent, with my constant questions about where they'd been and who they'd been with. Where, I thought, are my words of encouragement and love? It was three o'clock one afternoon when I got an urgent call from the hospital. Rebekah wanted me to come immediately with a blank tape. She was breathing hard when I entered her room. I slipped the tape into the recorder and held the microphone to her lips. \"Ruthie, Hannah, Molly, this is the most important tape.\" She held my hand and closed her eyes. \"Someday your daddy will bring home a new mommy.

Remember, I'll always love you. I shut off the recorder and Rebekah sighed deeply. \"Thank you, Nan, \"You'll give this one to them, won't you?\" she murmured as she slid into sleep.  A time would come when the tape would be played for Rebekah's children, but right then, after I smoothed Rebekah's blanket, I got in my car and hurried home.

{"answer": 3, "choices": ["they need more independence", "mothers want daughters to be mama's girls again", "they think their mothers' clothes are no longer in fashion", "all of the above"], "question": "What happens to mother-daughter relationships when girls become teenagers. It seems that girls go from playing \"dress up\", to arguing with their mothers about how they should dress. When a girl is 3-4 years old they love to \"dress up\" in their mothers' clothes, put on their mothers' makeup, cook, and do whatever else their mother does. This is the time when she can be classified as being a mama's girl. How come girls change so much from childhood to the teenage years? Many parents seek the answer when their daughter becomes a teen. Often when a girl enters high school her behavior changes as well as her physical appearance. When I was young I always liked playing \"dress up\". It made me feel older and more like my mother. Even when I entered middle school, I still depended a lot on my mother to choose and buy my clothes. Once I entered high school there was a big change. To me, my mother's clothes were no longer \"in fashion\", and neither was her opinion. I started becoming interested in boys and tried to improve the way I looked. It was not that I wanted to look cool, I just wanted to look my age. This is the time that the mother-daughter relationship can take a turn. It's difficult for a mother to know that her daughter is no longer totally dependent on her. When the daughter starts wearing revealing clothing, dating, and just wanting to be more independent, a mother starts to feel left out, or not needed.

It expresses agreement or approval. The word is used more often than any other word in the world. Language expert Allen Walker Read said the word began as a short way of writing a different spelling of the words \"all correct\". Old stories say some foreign-born people would write \"all correct\" as o-l-l k-o-r-r-e-c-t and spoke it as \"OK\". Some people say it came from the Native American Indian tribe known as the Choctaws. The Choctaw word \"okeh\" means the same as the American word \"OK\". Experts say early explorers in the Western America spoke the Choctaw language in the nineteenth century. The language spread across the country. According to some people, \"OK\" was a way to shorten Greek words that mean everything is fine. It is also said that a railroad worker named Obadiah Kelly invented the word. He is said to have put the first letters of his names -- O and K -- on each object people gave him to place on the train. Another explanation is that \"OK\" was invented by a political organization that supported Martin Van Buren for president in the 1800s. They called their organization the OK Club. The letters O and K were taken from the name of the town where Martin Van Buren was born -- Old Kinderhook, New York. Not everyone agrees with these explanations, but experts do agree that the word is purely American and has spread to almost every country on Earth. Yet in the United States, it is used mostly in speech. Serious writers prefer using words, such as \"agree\", \"approve\" or \"confirm\" instead. Where does the passage probably come from?", "subject": ""}

What do you know about them? The seahorse is actually not a horse but a fish, and much smaller than any regular horse. In general, a seahorse is about an inch long. It is a beautiful fish that likes warm waters, swims upright  , and looks a little like a chess piece. Seahorses are an unusual kind of animal because the males   give birth to babies. Mating   takes place in cooler waters on spring and summer nights with a full moon. The females   put their eggs into the bodies of the males, and the males give birth to baby seahorses. The seahorse can use each eye separately, which allows it to search for food without moving the rest of its body. Seahorses situate themselves near deep, fast-running channels rich in plankton, a kind of life on which they feed. They can catch food from an inch and a half away. Seahorses can change from gray or black to yellow or purple within seconds to fit in with their surroundings, and in this way escape from most of their enemies. One of the surprising facts about seahorses for most people is that they are vertebrates  . They can turn and curl freely, and like to swim in pairs connected by their tails. Their tails are powerful, and they can use them to grasp the surrounding seaweed   to keep themselves from being swept away. So seahorses are usually found in warm water filled with seaweed.

In fact, so-called gifted students may fail to do well because they are unusually smart. Ensuring that a gifted child reaches his or her potential requires an understanding of what can go wrong and how to satisfy the unusual learning requirements of extremely bright young people. One common problem gifted kids face is that they, and those around them, place too much importance on being smart. Such an emphasis can encourage a belief that bright people do not have to work hard to do well. Although smart kids may not need to work hard in the lower grades, when the work is easy, they may struggle and perform poorly when the work gets harder because they do not make the effort to learn. If the academic achievement of highly intelligent children remains below average for an extended period, many teachers will fail to recognize their potential. As a result, such students may not get the encouragement they need, further depressing their desire to learn. They may fall far behind in their schoolwork and even develop behavior problems. IQ is just one element among many in the recipe for success--Children develop well or struggle in school for a host of reasons apart from IQ. These include motivation and persistence, social competence, and the support of family, educators and friends.  Because highly gifted children solve the most varied thought problems faster and more thoroughly than those with more average talents do, they need additional intellectual stimulation while they wait for the rest of the kids to learn the basics. Two central approaches are used to satisfy the educational needs of such children: acceleration and enrichment. Acceleration means studying material that is part of the standard subjects for older students. Enrichment involves learning information that falls outside the usual subjects. A child might skip one or more grades as a way of accelerating in school. But being with older children for the entire school day--and perhaps for grade-based extracurricular activities such as sports--can make a child feel inferior in every filed outside of academics. One very bright fourth-grader who had skipped two grades remained far ahead of his classmates intellectually, but as his classmates reached adolescence, his social and other shortcomings became painfully apparent. While acceleration is not an option, or not a good one, enrichment can be. After all, school is not a race but an adventure in learning. As such, the goal is not finishing first but absorbing as much knowledge as possible in the time assigned. Thus, providing opportunities for a child to study topics outside the regular subjects can be at least as valuable as pushing him or her through the required material faster.

The octopus can indeed be a deadly hunter, but only of its natural victims. Some shellfish and an occasional sick or incautious fish have reason to be frightened of this multi-armed hunter, but a person is much too large to interest even the biggest octopus. Even the largest among octopi is much smaller than most people imagine.

Many of the \"Dutch\" expressions heard in American English were first used in England in the seventeenth century. Britain used to be called \"empire on which the sun never sets\",which gained its supreme  power mostly by its naval( )military forces. The period of the Anglo-Dutch Wars was a time of fierce naval competition between England and the Netherlands. At that time, the British used \"Dutch\" as a word for something bad, or false, or mistaken. A \"Dutch agreement\" was one made between men who had drunk too much alcohol. \"Dutch courage\" was the false courage produced by the effects of drinking alcohol. And \"Dutch leave\" was what a solider took when he left his base without permission. Some of these old expressions are still used today with a little different meaning. \"Dutch treat\" is one example. Long ago, a Dutch treat was a dinner at which the invited guests were expected to pay for their own share of the food and drink. Now, Dutch treat means that when friends go out to have fun, each person pays his own share. Another common expression heard a few years ago was \"in Dutch\", which simply referred to the country then. Nowadays, if someone says to you, you are in Dutch, they are telling you that you were in trouble. An important person, a parent or teacher perhaps, is angry with you. Some of the Dutch expressions heard in American English have nothing to do with the Dutch people at all. In the 1700s, Germans who moved to the United States often were called Dutch. This happened because of mistakes in understanding and saying the word \"Deutsch\", the German word for German. Families of these German people still live in the eastern United States, many in the state of Pennsylvania. They are known as the Pennsylvania Dutch. During the American Civil War, supporters of the northern side in the central state of Missouri were called Dutch, because many of them were German settlers.

And I was lucky that at 18 I knew what I exactly wanted to do. But I didn't know who I was. How could I? And how could any of us?

Modern airplanes have two black boxes: a voice recorder, which tracks pilots' conversations, and a flight-data recorder, which monitors fuel levels, engine noises and other operating functions that help investigators reconstruct the aircraft's final moments. Placed in an insulated   case and surrounded by a quarter-inch-thick panels of stainless steel, the boxes can withstand massive force and temperatures up to 2,000degF. When submerged , they're also able to emit signals from depths of 20,000 ft. Experts believe the boxes from Air France Flight 447, which crashed near Brazil on June 1,2009, are in water nearly that deep, but statistics say they're still likely to turn up. In the approximately 20 deep-sea crashes over the past 30 years, only one plane's black boxes were never recovered. What do we know about the black boxes from Air France Flight 447?", "subject": ""}

Now American author Thomas Friedman tells us the Earth is flat in his best seller: The World Is Flat: A Brief History of the Twenty-First Century. If he is not joking, then why is the world flat? Friedman says it is due to technological forces. Because of the Internet and the World Wide Web, he believes geographical barriers   are disappearing. Individuals   and companies around the world can cooperate or compete on the same level. Bill Gates explains the meaning of this transformation best. \"Thirty years ago,\" he tells Friedman, \"if you had to choose between being born a genius in Shanghai and an average person in Poughkeepsid (a city in southeast New York), you would have chosen Poughkeepsie because your chances of living a wonderful life were much greater there. \"Now,\" Gates says, \"I would rather be a genius born in China than an average person born in Poughkeepsie.\" This shows that success today is determined more by ability than by location. \"Globalization 3.0\", as he calls it, is driven by ambitious individuals: freelancers   and creative new businesses all over the world, especially in India and China. They can compete not just for low-salary manufacturing industry but, increasingly, for the highest-end research and design work as well. Big companies have played another important role in this globalization process. They move their factories from one country to another to cut costs. It's usual now for an engineer in China to be working for an American company. The Internet keeps them in constant touch with their American partners. People everywhere, from the US to China, have procedures of the same standard for getting their work done. The Reuters news agency provides a good example. The company moved its operation offices from London and New York to India. The Indian employees have the necessary technical skills. But the salaries and office rents are less than one-fifth of what they would be in New York or London. Friedman tells us that the Earth is flat   _  .", "subject": ""}

The news of a deal to bring home the kidnapped soldier Gilad Shalit , a young man held prisoner by Hamas for five years,spread. But the happiness was hardened by the reality of the price Israelis had paid to set him free. The 1,027 Palestinian prisoners to be exchanged for the single Israeli corporal turned out to include men and women convicted  of some of the worst terrorist attacks in the country.  \"Ambivalent,\" says Aya Ilouz, of her feelings on the matter. Strolling in downtown Jerusalem with her husband Liron and their 5-month-old daughter Yael, the couple is so in sync on the question of the day that they finish each other's thoughts. \"Yes,\" says Liron, \"we are very happy and excited to see Gilad meet his family. And on the other hand--\" \"We are very concerned,\" says Aya. \"About what happens next,\" Liron explains. \"When the next terrorist blows himself up, someone will have to answer.\" Just around the corner, on King George Street, Alan Bauer had been walking home with his son on March 21, 2002, when a Palestinian man named Mohammad Hashaika exploded a suicide vest packed with metal scraps. Eighty-four people were wounded that day. Of the three killed, one was a woman pregnant with twins. Though the bomber of course died, Israeli courts convicted the two women who drove him to the site of the bombing, easing his way past the Israeli checkpoint by buying flowers to carry in the Mother's Day crowd.  \"These women, as I speak, are being released,\" Bauer says. Specifics have a way of weakening the joy of Shalit's release. Among the 477 prisoners released on Tuesday, in the first phase of the exchange, are an organizer of the 2002 Passover bombing that killed 30 people; a woman who developed an online relationship with a lovesick Israeli youth she then had murdered when he came to meet her; and the man who proudly displayed his bloody hands to the mob  gathered outside the Ramallah building where two Israeli soldiers were beaten to death after making a wrong turn on Oct. 12, 2000.  When the list became public,  s of terrorism victims appealed, without success, to Israel's supreme court to prevent the prisoner exchange. The court hearing was interrupted repeatedly by upset survivors, including Shvuel Schijveschuurder, who lost five of his family members in a 2001 attack at a Jerusalem Sbarro. To protest the release of the woman who drove the suicide bomber to the pizza restaurant, Schijveschuurder poured paint on a memorial to Yitzhak Rabin, the Prime Minister slain by an Israeli extremist for signing the Oslo Accords. \"When we say 1,027 prisoners will be released, it's abstract, it doesn't mean anything,\" says Eliad Moreh Rosenberg, who was wounded in the 2002 terrorism bombing at the Hebrew University cafeteria. \"But for victims of terror, it's a reality.\" Israeli officials calculate that 60% of those released resume terrorism attacks. To help prevent that resumption this time around, Israel insisted that most of the prisoners liberated be sent either to the Gaza Strip -- which is sealed off from Israel and under the control of Hamas, which says it continues to observe a cease-fire -- or into exile  in Turkey, Qatar or Syria. About 100 arrived in the West Bank, where the government led by Palestinian Authority President Mahmoud Abbas works diligently to suppress terrorism, cooperating with Israeli intelligence and military. With the future uncertain, on Tuesday, Jewish Israelis stopped and stared at televisions wherever they came upon them. On the sidewalk at midmorning outside the 24-hour Hillel Market, 50 people were gathered under a flat screen to catch the first images of Shalit, looking painfully thin . \"It was moving. It was very exciting,\" says Anat Rubin, 42. \"I just saw photos of him getting out of the car. It gave me chills.\" But she says she heard Hamas say that, learning from success, it was keen to kidnap more Israelis in order to win freedom for the 6,000 Palestinians still in Israeli prisons. \"I don't want to see the photos of them doing the V for victory,\" she says. \"Like they won. They are really releasing murderers. I'm happy and sad all together.\" What's the main idea of the passage?", "subject": ""}

The network would eventually carry passengers from London to Beijing and then to Singapore. It would also run to India and Pakistan, according to Wang Mengshu, a member of the Chinese Academy of Engineering and a senior consultant on China's high-speed rail project. A second project would see trains heading north through Russia to Germany and into the European railway system, and a third line will extend south to connect Vietnam, Thailand, Myanmar and Malaysia. Mr. Wang said that the rail lines will draw together and open up the whole of Central, East and Southeast Asia, which would also allow China to transport valuable raw materials more efficiently. Mr. Wang said the route of the three lines had yet to be decided, but that construction for the South East Asian line had already begun in the southern province of Yunnan and that Burma was about to begin building its link. China has offered to supply money to the Burmese line in exchange for the country's rich reserves of lithium, a metal widely used in batteries.

What about vegetables? Would it surprise you to learn that what you eat can affect the whole planet? It can--in a big way. Scientists attending the American Association for the Advancement of Science meeting in Chicago presented new studies showing how food and its production affect the globe and its warming climate. It is generally believed that global warming is caused by the large amounts of greenhouse gases released into the atmosphere. One of these greenhouse gases is carbon dioxide. What does this have to do with food? A big part of the carbon dioxide comes from the process of making and eating food, the scientists reported in Chicago. The production of meat contributes to a lot of that carbon dioxide. The process of making a hamburger, for example, requires a lot of energy. A cow has to be fed and raised on farmland, and cow manure is a major source of methane --an especially powerful greenhouse gas. By the time a hamburger is finally served on a dinner plate, it has done great harm to the environment. The message from the research is clear: We can greatly reduce the production of greenhouse gases by eating less meat. All kinds of meat, the scientists reported, are harder on the planet than vegetables. To grow and eat a pound of potatoes, for example, sends less than one-quarter pound of carbon dioxide or other greenhouse gases into the air.

If we don't reduce each individual's demand for water (both directly and through embodied water) the water situation will become dire. It is obvious that we cannot increase demands for water much more without detrimental  effects to the environment, society and the economy. It's all too easy to blame someone else for the water situation -\"if 70% of water is used for agriculture then that's what we should target\" - but it's not that easy. We all depend on the food and resources that agriculture provides, and while there are definitely opportunities to increase water efficiency on the farm, the solution will take more than that. We each share responsibility for the sustainable management of our water resources, which means using less water at home, in the workplace, at school, on holidays, on the farm, ... everyone, everywhere, every time. It's time to become water efficient! This involves reassessing our relationship with water, and learning to use it more sparingly. On the most basic level, it requires a behavioural  change, and assigning a value to water that truly reflects its worth. We can also unlock economic benefits of being water efficient.

The physical book is so elegant that it disappears into the background, and what remains is the author's world. Today, we at Amazon are excited to announce Mindle, a wireless, portable reading device with instant access to more than 90,000 books, magazines and newspapers. We've been working on Mindle for more than three years. Our top design objective was for Mindle to disappear in your hands--to get out of the way--so you can enjoy your reading. We also wanted to go beyond the physical book. Mindle is wireless, so whether you're lying in bed or riding a train, you can think of a book, and have it in less than 60 seconds. No computer is needed--you do your reading directly from the device. We chose the same wireless technology used in advanced mobile phones. But unlike mobile phones, there are no monthly wireless bills, no service or data plans, and no yearly contracts. There is no software to install (,).  We want you to get lost in your reading and not in the technology. Mindle uses a new kind of display called electronic paper. Sharp and natural with no strong light, reading on Mindle is nothing like reading from a computer screen. Mindle weighs only 10.3 ounces--less than paperback--but can carry two hundred books.

Today, we at Amazon are excited to announce Mindle, a wireless, portable reading device with instant access to more than 90,000 books, magazines and newspapers. We've been working on Mindle for more than three years. Our top design objective was for Mindle to disappear in your hands--to get out of the way--so you can enjoy your reading. We also wanted to go beyond the physical book. Mindle is wireless, so whether you're lying in bed or riding a train, you can think of a book, and have it in less than 60 seconds. No computer is needed--you do your reading directly from the device. We chose the same wireless technology used in advanced mobile phones. But unlike mobile phones, there are no monthly wireless bills, no service or data plans, and no yearly contracts. There is no software to install (,).  We want you to get lost in your reading and not in the technology. Mindle uses a new kind of display called electronic paper.

Asperger's Syndrome is a developmental disorder that affects a person's ability to socialize. But instead of putting them into prison for what they did to him, Gavin offered them a chance to become more tolerant and understanding. On Thursday night, some kids were talking about how \"it's weird \" that he is always by himself, attending events alone and watching people, and it was \"creepy\" that he wanted to be friends with people he didn't know.  On Friday night, another kid that overheard that conversation decided to take matters into his own hands and become judge and jury, and this is the result of that. He didn't ask questions, didn't get to know Gavin, never met him, and didn't give him a chance to leave. Gavin was called to meet someone, surrounded by people he didn't know, choked, punched , and left lying on the pavement so he would \"learn his lesson\". Gavin emerged from the attack with a concussion , a fractured nose, a bruised esophagus  and some damage to his eyes, but thankfully, none of the injuries resulted in permanent damage. But here's the truly amazing part -- Gavin refused to press charges against the people who did this to him. Instead of wanting to see them punished, he wants to see them educated. Gavin asked that his attackers do community service that is disability-related.

But for employees at data services provider, Interxion, a chaotic commute  during the Olympics will  _ . That's because, in an effort to keep things from progressing slowly this summer, bosses at the London company are asking staff to sleep at work -- in space pods. Far from sleeping on the job, engineers will be asked to stay behind and sleep in the closed capsules to avoid the rush hour. And while other companies are planning to offer staff the luxury of working from home during the Games, the firm behind the capsules hopes to get more workplaces on board. Podtime, the firm behind the unusual cabins, are describing them as the perfect solution to the Olympics' crowded commute.

Although his passing was very difficult for her, I think their shared struggle to make his life longer taught grandma that good health was not to be taken for granted, and she made up her mind to live the rest of her own life as fully and as long as she could. One day, when she announced to attend lessons at the Fred Astaire Dance Studio in Portland, Oregon, where she lived, we rolled our eyes in embarrassment and helplessly wished she would just stay home and bake cookies as normal grandmothers did. Many years filled with countless dance lessons passed before we learned to appreciate the wonder of having a dancing grandma. I suppose grandma's primary motivation for wanting to learn to dance was social. She had been a shy girl, always very tall and heavy, and had married into grandpa's quiet lifestyle before developing any elegance or confidence in her personal appearance. Dancing, on the other hand, filled her life with flash lights, wonderful parties, beautiful dresses, handsome young dance instructors, and the challenge of learning. Although the weekly dance lessons did not change her ample, two-hundred-pound figure, grandma surprised everyone with energetic performances on the dance floor, which soon gave her as much elegance and confidence as any Miss American competitor. Having taken weekly dance lessons for years, my grandma learned various dances easily and was soon participating in dancing matches all over the Northwest. When I was fourteen, grandma proudly invited me to watch her compete in one of these matches to be held in the grand ballroom of the Red Lion Inn.

A few years ago, when Grandma left this earth, I bid farewell to a loving grandmother. How quickly our lives can change. We had just had tea together a couple of months earlier, on her 91st birthday. I missed her very much. On one particular birthday, when I was feeling a little low, something happened to make me feel like she was sharing that special day with me. I was arranging some colorful pillows that she had made, and suddenly I felt something inside one pillow. It was small and hard. I moved the object to a seam  that I carefully opened, and to my delight out came a tiny silver thimble! How happy I was to find something that had been a part of her. Not realizing it had fallen off her finger, I pictured her sewing it in that little pillow that I just happened to place on my bedspread that day. I carefully laid the thimble alongside the others I've collected over the years, where I could continue to see the gift God chose to reveal to me. What a precious memory of a very special lady who somehow, I knew, was laughing in delight at sewing her thimble inside my pillow. I made some tea, using my best china, as Grandma always did, and enjoyed my tea and Grandma's thimble. What a wonderful birthday that was! What is the best title for the passage?", "subject": ""}

Mr. Pontellier had forgotten the candies and peanuts that he had promised the boys. Still, he loved them very much and went into the room where they slept to take a look at them and make sure that they were resting comfortably.

Mr. Pontellier returned to his wife with the information that Raoul had a high fever and needed looking after. Then he lit his cigar and went and sat near the open door to smoke it.

He assured her the child was burning with fever at that moment in the next room. He reproached his wife with her inattention, her habitual neglect of the children.

She went on crying there, not caring any longer to dry her face, her eyes, her arms. She could not have told why she was crying. Such experiences as had just happened were not uncommon in her married life. They seemed never before to have weighed much against theabundance   of her husband's kindness and a uniform devotion which had come to be self-understood. An indescribable oppression, which seemed to generate in some unfamiliar part of her consciousness, filled her whole being with vague pain. It was like a shadow, like a mist passing across her soul's summer day. It was strange and unfamiliar; it was a mood.

Finally he contributed much to the careers he devoted to and became one of the most famous scientists in the world. Hawking was outstanding in his school life. After a successful period of education at St. Albans School, the entrance of Oxford opened to him. In March 1959, at the age of 17, Hawking took the scholarship examination with the aim of studying natural sciences at Oxford. Then Hawking went to Cambridge to do research in cosmology. When Stephen Hawking was dreaming about his future, he faced extreme difficulties and obstacles. Symptoms of disorder first appeared while he was enrolled at Cambridge; he lost his balance and fell down a flight of stairs, hitting his head. The diagnosis   of motor neuron  disease came when Hawking was 21, shortly before his first marriage, and doctors said he would not survive more than two or three years. Hawking gradually lost the use of his arms, legs, and voice, and is now almost completely paralyzed .

Its location on the east bank of the Mississippi River gave it control of the American hinerland and it became strategically important to many nations. It was transferred from France to Spain, returned to France, and finally sold by Napoleon to the United States in 1803. The city was the site of a famous battle fought in 1815 between the British, who hoped to control it, and the Americans under General Andrew Jackson. The riverbed of the Mississippi is constantly silting and the river is now actually higher than the city. Levees hold back the river and giant pumps are used to move water from the city into the river. Although New Orleans has been a part of the United States for almost two centuries, its population takes great pride in its French heritage. Louisiana still retains parts of the Code Napoleon which, for many years, was its only law. New Orleans is carefree city and it boasts its hot, spicy Creole seafood and its native Dixieland Jazz. The Jackson Square neighborhood maintains its French colonial homes and in other sections are pre-Civil War mansions. Visitors are surprised to find that behind this interesting surface of yesteryear is a busy industrial and port city. Grain and coal come from the Midwest and foreign goods are unloaded here.
