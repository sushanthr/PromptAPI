Its location on the east bank of the Mississippi River gave it control of the American hinerland and it became strategically important to many nations. It was transferred from France to Spain, returned to France, and finally sold by Napoleon to the United States in 1803. The city was the site of a famous battle fought in 1815 between the British, who hoped to control it, and the Americans under General Andrew Jackson. The riverbed of the Mississippi is constantly silting and the river is now actually higher than the city.

{"answer": 1, "choices": ["satisfying an interest in novelty", "signaling a change in personal beliefs", "displaying membership in a social group", "following traditional rules"], "question": "One's style of the dress reveals the human obsession with both novelty and tradition. People use clothing to declare their membership in a particular social group; however, the rules for what is acceptable dress for that group may change. In affluent societies, this changing of the rules is the driving force behind fashions. By keeping up with fashions, that is, by changing their clothing style frequently but meanwhile, members of a group both satisfy their desire for and obey the rules, thus demonstrating their membership in the group. There are some interesting variations   regarding individual status. Some people, particularly in the West, consider themselves of such high status that they do not need to display it with their clothing. For example, many wealthy people in the entertainment industry appear in very casual clothes, such as the worn jeans and work boots of a manual laborer. However, it is likely that a subtle but important signal, such as an expensive wristwatch, will prevail over the message of the casual dress. Such an inverted  status display is most likely to occur where the person's high status is conveyed in ways other than with clothing, such as having a famous face.

Scientists say the campaign planned for 2013 and 2014 will restore beautiful South Georgia to the position it once held as the world's most important nesting sites for seabirds. It was sailors in the late 18th century who unintentionally introduced rats to what had been a fresh environment. \"If we can destroy the rats, at least 100 million birds will return to their home on South Georgia,\" says Tony Martin, a biology professor at the University of Dundee who was invited to lead the project. South Georgia is by far the largest island to get rid of animals that destroy native wildlife after being introduced deliberately or accidentally by people. Though rats and mice have done the most damage, cats, foxes, goats, deer, rabbits and other species have been targeted in the campaigns around the world.

Apparently many college students would have no problem with that. They believe students are owed a good grade simply because they put a lot of effort into a class. The researchers asked more than 800 undergraduates if they agreed or disagreed with some statements. For example: \"If I have completed most of the reading for a class, I deserve a B in that course.\" And: \"A professor should not be annoyed with me if I receive an important call during class.\" Just 16 percent thought it was OK to take that phone call. But 66 percent agreed that a professor should consider effort and not just the quality of a student's work when deciding grades. And 40 percent thought they should get a B, the second highest mark, just because they did most of the reading for class. Some experts are not surprised that students often see no difference between effort and results. Social critics like to say that in children's activities these days everyone gets an award just for trying, so no one will feel rejected. Yet competition to get into the best colleges is fiercer than ever. Students may worry that low grades will keep them out of graduate school or a good job. And there may be another explanation: pressure from parents to get a good return on the family's investment. These days, college can cost more than a house.

Men have coloured shirts and western trousers that they wear only when square dancing. In some country areas, everyone wears his best clothes.

But his magical world - where witches   cast spells and castles float in the sky - is brought to life by hand. Nevertheless, Hayao Miyazaki is referred to as Japan's Walt Disney and considered by many to be the world's greatest living animator. This month, the 72-year-old Miyazaki announced his retirement. The Japanese animator has directed 11 animated full-length films over the past four decades, including the Oscar-winning Spirited Away (<<>> ) and his latest release, The Wind Rises (<<>> ), which tells the life story of a man who designed Japanese World War II fighter planes. Just as The Wind Rises shows, Miyazaki is well-known for his obsession with flight, especially human flight. Other striking aspects of Miyazaki's films include his themes of environmental protection and the horrors of war. Miyazaki's work is also famous for its lack of clearly defined good and evil characters. He sees the 21st century as a complex time when old norms need to be re-examined.

As a visual   artist, most of Miyazaki's grace comes from his vivid   colors and lovingly drawn landscapes - a rolling meadow   covered with flowers and shadowed by clouds, or a range of rocky hills rising toward snow-capped mountain peaks People attribute Miyazaki's success to his long pursuit of his hand-drawn technique, although in an interview with CNN he called himself an \"extinct species\" in the age of digital animation.

During World War II, editions were published for the first time in Latin America and Sweden. After the war Reader's Digest moved into Australia, Belgium, Canada, Denmark, Finland, France, Germany, Italy, Norway, South Africa and Switzerland. In 1950, Reader's Digest published its shortened Books (now known as Select Editions in Australia). In 1959, music, the first non-print product line, was introduced.

{"answer": 0, "choices": ["its response to an unclear event is pessimistic", "it will pay little attention to an unclear event", "it is easy for it to make right decisions", "it has more opportunities to get food"], "question": "How can we measure animals' emotions? A new study of animal's emotions suggests that, as in humans, emotions can tell animals about how dangerous their world is, and guide the choices that they make. The article of the study by Bristol University's professor Mike Mendl was published online. An animal living in an environment where it is often threatened by predators will develop a negative emotion or \"mood\", such as anxiety. However, one in an environment with plenty of opportunities to get resources for survival will be in a more positive mood state. The researchers say that these emotional states not only show the animal's experiences, but also help it decide how to make choices, especially in unclear situations. This could have good or bad results. An animal in a negative mood state will make a safety-first with a \"pessimistic\" response to an unclear event. For example, it considers a noise in the grass as a signal of the predator. At the same time, an animal in a positive mood state will benefit from a more \"optimistic\" response.

{"answer": 0, "choices": ["How we perceive the food we eat.", "What ingredients the food contains.", "When we eat our meals.", "How fast we eat our meals."], "question": "In recent years, a growing body of research has shown that our appetite and food intake are influenced by a large number of factors besides our biological need for energy, including our eating environment and our perception of the food in front of us.      Studies have shown. for instance. that eating in front of the TV (or a similar distraction) can increase both hunger and the amount of food consumed. Even simple visual cues( ). like plate size and lighting, have been shown to affect portion size and consumption.       A new study suggested that our shot-term memory also may play a role in appetite.  Several hours after a meal, people's hunger levels were predicted not by how much they'd eaten but rather by how much food they'd seen in front of them --- in other words, how much they remembered eating.       This difference suggests the memory of our previous meal may have a bigger influence on our appetite than the actual size of the meal. says Jeffrey M . Brunstrom , a professor of experimental psychology at the University of Bristol.     \"Hunger isn't. controlled solely by the physical characteristics of a recent meal. We have identified an independent role for memory for that meal.\" Brunstrom says. \"This shows that the relationship between hunger and food intake is more complex than we thought.\"      These findings echo earlier research that suggests our perception of food can sometimes trick our body's response to the food itself. In a 2011 study, for instance, people who drank the same 380-calorie milkshake on two separate occasions produced different levels of hunger-related hormones, depending on whether the shake's label said it contained 620 0r 140 calories. Moreover, the participants reported feeling more full when they thought they'd consumed a higher-calorie shake.      What does this means for our eating habits? Although it hardly seems practical to trick ourselves in to eating less, the new findings do highlight the benefits of focusing on our food avoiding TV and multitasking while eating.

A US-based study found a total of 116 reports of death or injury to pedestrians wearing headphones between 2004 and 2011 , jumping from 16 in 2005 to 47 in 2011 . Most victims were men (68%) and under the age of 30 (67%) , with around one in ten of all cases (9%) under the age of 18 .Some 89% of the cases occurred in urban areas and more than half (55%) of the victims were struck by trains . Eighty-one of the 116 accidents (70%) resulted in the person's death--- even though a warning was sounded in around a third of the cases . The study concluded , \" The use of headphone may be a safety risk to pedestrians , especially in environments with moving vehicles(cars) . Further research is needed to determine if and how headphone use threatens pedestrian safety .\" British road safety groups warned pedestrians to be careful. Floor Lieshout , director of Youth For Road Safety , said, \" This study shows once more the importance of using all of our senses while we are near traffic . It is important that we find an attractive way to make youth learn about the risks of wearing headphones in traffic .\" Andrew Howard , who is the head of road safety at the Automobile Association , added that some pedestrians can be \"so focused in their own little world they forget the world going on around them\".That can include headphone wearers , Howard said, but also people talking on phones.

If Roberts' character were from Britain then she would probably apologize repeatedly as well--even if the crash were not her fault. But this doesn't happen in the film, as Roberts is from the US. A report in The Telegraph last week said that three-quarters of British people apologize when they bump into someone in the street -- regardless of whether they are responsible or not. In fact, we Britons use \"sorry\" in many situations. For example, if we mishear someone, we say \"Sorry?\" The person we are talking to will also apologize by replying: \"No, I am sorry!\" This can go on for up to five minutes as we compete over who is the most sorry. Life is never as simple as \"duibuqi\" and \"meiguanxi\". How we use \"sorry\" has changed. Traditionally, \"sorry\" was used to express deep regret, but a survey in 2007 showed that we use it to mean anything from \"what\" to \"whatever\". Why are Britons so sorry? Mark Tyrell, a psychology writer in the UK, thinks about our apologetic tendencies are rooted in the British class system. We say sorry because historically the new middle classes in Britain had to apologize for not being working class, but also for not really being upper class. Another theory is that we apologize to avoid confrontation . For example, if you bump into someone they might get angry. To avoid this we instantly say \"Sorry!\". True manners are about being considerate and the modern day obsession with apologizing show that we are perhaps not as thoughtful as we once were. The word has lost some of its meaning.

{"answer": 2, "choices": ["4", "5", "6", "7"], "question": "Military training has long been considered a ritual  that freshmen must go through in order to officially start their college lives. While some question the necessity of such training. Many students see military training as a campus tradition that should be maintained. Early in February, the Ministry of Education issued a new regulation that colleges and universities should carry out a minimum of 14 days compulsory military training for freshmen. In a report by Beijing Evening News, Hou Zhengfang, a Beijing-based education PhD, questioned the benefits of military training. \"The training routine does little to improve students' physical fitness over only two weeks' time. Maybe some disaster prevention training, such as earthquake survival or escaping from fires would be of greater benefit.\" Meng Yang, a 19-year-old freshman at Guangxi University, fainted during training. She said that many students, especially girls, are willing to train under direct sunshine. \"For me, military training is physically challenging and even damages my health.\" According to Li Jian from the student affairs office of Guangzhou University, feeling dizzy  happens frequently during military training and the school has received a lot of complaints from both students and parents: \"But I still think military training is a good thing. Students are easier to manage after the military training. They became more positive about their new environment after the training.\" Although autumn is fast approaching Beijing, the noon heat burns 3300 freshmen on Tsinghua University's campus.

Only 13 percent of the French respondents believed they are proficient in the language, according to the European data agency Eurostat. The situation is no better in business circles, where three-quarters of French executives feel unprepared to hold an interview in English and only 16 percent say they feel comfortable with the language, a separate survey showed. The survey results aren't surprising. The French seem to have always had this cold and gloomy attitude toward the English language. But what struck me is that, despite the French pessimism, living in Paris without being able to speak the language of Moliere is easier these days than in the past. New immigrants are part of the reason. I can have an easy chat with the owner of the laundry in my neighborhood. Buying the medicine I need at the local pharmacy is effortless. Ordering a meal in English at the restaurant two blocks away from my apartment does not make me feel awkward. It is all because the people who run these businesses are immigrants. Greater tolerance and acceptance of non-French speakers is a reflection of the fact that France, willingly or not, has begun to embrace  globalization more comfortably. For instance, you will never get the same look you would have had 15 years ago if you ask for directions in English on the streets of Paris. I have also met many native French who are happy to communicate in English. They are usually the kind of people who are open-minded and are sensitive to the changes beyond their own territories. They are very interested in gaining insight into what is happening on the other side of the globe. In my hometown, English is also being hotly debated since Beijing education authorities decided to reduce the importance of English proficiency in college entrance exams and increase that of the Chinese language and literature.

{"answer": 2, "choices": ["Ubayd Steed.", "Jacob Harder.", "Eric Anderman.", "Michael Josephson."], "question": "In October, Ubayd Steed, a sixth grader in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania, was taking a math test when he noticed a classmate looking at his paper. \" I quickly turned my paper over,\" he said. Later that day, Ubayd met the cheater and told him not to do it again. Unfortunately, Ubayd' s experience is not unusual. Whether it's kids copying class -mates' answers during tests or friends sharing homework, cheating happens in schools every day. Experts say the behavior starts in the lower grades. Surveys show that one in three elementary students admits to cheating. Jacob Harder, a fourth grader in Ware, Massachusetts, has had classmates ask to copy his homework. \"I wouldn't want to just tell them the answers,\" he says. So instead, he explains the task and encourages his classmates to do it themselves. But many kids find it hard to say no. \"l hear from kids all the time, ' I can' t say no to a friend,'\" says Eric Anderman, a professor at The Ohio State University who studies cheating in school. He says it' s important to say no from the start. \"Then you _ , and the other kid gets the message,\" he says. Plus, he points out, \"a real friend is not going to disown you because he or she couldn't copy your math homework.\" The kids doing the copying may feel they need to cheat to be accepted by other kids. And some students may cheat simply because others do. \"If you' re in an atmosphere where cheating is common, you may think that if you don' t cheat, you' re at a disadvantage,\" says Michael Josephson, founder of the Josephson Institute of Ethics. But Josephson says students shouldn't think that way. \"There are a lot of things kids do,\" he says. \"You have to decide what kind of person you' re going to be.\" When school becomes too challenging, Anderman suggests going to the teacher rather than relying on the work of others. \"It' s good to ask for help,\" he says.

The name of the earliest palace was Placentia. Its windows were made of glass--the first in England. But trouble was coming to Greenwich. In 1649, a war started in England and for eleven years there was no king. The men who had worked for him at Placentia decided to live in the place themselves.

Professor Worm says species have recently been disappearing from oceans at increasing speed. At this rate, he says, all seafood species could collapse by 2048 and seafood supplies from the world's ocean could be almost gone by then. Other studies have also warned about the dangers of overfishing and the effects on ocean environments. But not everyone thinks the oceans are likely to be empty in fifty years. Some scientists said parts of the world do have problems, but others are doing a good job of protecting fish populations. Government officials in several countries with large fishing industries also questioned the research. The study appeared earlier this month in Science magazine. The researchers say damage to oceans affects not only fish populations but also the productivity of ecosystems. These complex systems help control water quality. The scientists say the loss of different kinds of sea life appeared to increase the risk of fish kills and beach closures from harmful algae growth. The scientists examined the results of thirty-two experiments and observed forty-eight protected areas. They also looked at records of catches worldwide. They studied records from the United Nations Food and Agriculture Organization for nineteen fifty to two thousand three. And they examined archeological information and other historical records for twelve coastal areas. That research reached back over a thousand years. Boris Worm says the findings were, in his words, \"beyond anything we suspected.\" But he also said the situation is not too late to correct.

All my money went to the family then,\" he said. During the next two days Mr. Evans will be taken on a short tour of London to see the sights. Top of his list is a visit to the House of Parliament organized by his MP, Mr. Gareth Wardell. The only arrangement he does not care for is the wheelchair provided for him if he gets tired. \"I don't like the chair -- people will think I am getting old. \" he said. His secret for a long and healthy life has been well publicized -- no wine, no tobacco and no anger. Before setting off from Swansea with his 76-year-old son, Amwell, he said jokingly, \"I'm glad to see they've given me a return ticket. \" The probable explanation to Mr. Evans' long life lies in   _  .", "subject": ""}

Galileo was one of the first people to use a telescope to study the sky. Since then, telescopes have become the most important tool used by astronomers. Scientists never stop finding new ways to make these instruments more powerful. In the next several years, two new telescopes with different purposes are to be used.     One of the telescopes, called Pan-STARRS, could save humans from dying out. Nick Kaiser, a scientist who works on the project, says the Pan-STARRS telescope has been designed to find \"90 percent of all killer asteroids  near Earth\".    Pan-STARRS, like most telescopes, uses mirrors and lenses  to provide pictures of outer space. Giant mirrors are used to \"gather\" light. They reflect the light onto the lens of a camera, which can then record the image.     When completed, Pan-STARRS will include four telescopes which will be put on top of a mountain on the Hawaiian island of Maui. Only one telescope is in place and working now. Each telescope will take pictures of one patch of sky for about 30 seconds, and then move on to another patch. Every night, each telescope will take pictures of about 1,000 patches. Every week, each telescope will have photographed the whole sky.     Each of the four telescopes will take pictures of the same patches of sky. One telescope, working alone, may sometimes incorrectly show an asteroid. If there are three other telescopes working, astronomers can use them to see if there really is an asteroid coming our way.

Instead, they learn both explicit and hidden meanings from what they see. Actually, children learn early the psychology of characters in TV shows. Furthermore, as many teachers agree, children understand far more when parents watch TV with them, explaining new words and ideas. Yet, most parents use an educational program as a chance to park their kids in front of the set and do something in another room. Another argument against television is that it replaces reading as a form of entertainment. But according to Anderson, the amount of time spent watching television is not related to reading ability. TV doesn't take the place of reading for most children; it takes the place of similar sorts of recreation, such as listening to the radio and playing sports.

Traditional wisdom also has it that heavy television-watching lowers IQ   scores and affects school performance. But here, too, Anderson notes that no studies have proved it. In fact, research suggests that it's the other way around. \"If you're smart young, you'll watch less TV when you're older,\" Anderson says. Yet, people of lower IQ tend to be lifelong television viewers. For years researchers have attempted to show that television is dangerous to children. However, by showing that television promotes none of the dangerous effects as conventionally believed, Anderson suggests that television cannot be condemned without considering other influences.

The Mediterranean Sea The Mediterranean Sea can be accessed from various European countries as well as a few North African countries. And while many think of visiting Ibiza, Malta, or the Greek islands to experience the Mediterranean, my Mediterranean beach days came while visiting the seaside city of Marseille in the South of France!

Not only were the beaches amazing, but the city of Marseille was adorable and filled with numerous cute shops and seaside restaurants. And the Mediterranean-style food was delicious! The Adriatic Sea The Adriatic Sea is equally as stunning and surely worth a visit! The Croatian coast has numerous beach clubs, some private and some public, that tourists are able to visit and you can experience the beauty of the Adriatic Sea there!

It is not only a financial problem but also a question of the system we want for our society. I would like to suggest several possible solutions to this problem. First,employers should take the responsibility for their retired employees. To make this possible,a percentage of profits should be set aside for this purpose. But when a company must take lifelong responsibility for its employees,it may suffer from a commercial disadvantage due to higher employee costs. Another way of solving the problem is to return the responsibility to the individual. This means each person must save during his working years to pay for his years of retirement. This does not seem a very fair model since some people have enough trouble paying for their daily life without trying to earn extra to cover their retirement years. This means the government might have to step in to care for the poor. In addition,the government could take the responsibility for the care of the old. This could be financed through government taxes to increase the level of pensions. Furthermore,some institutions should be created for senior citizens,which can help provide a comfortable life for them. Unfortunately,as the present situation in our country shows,this is not a truly viable answer. The government can seldom afford to care for the old,particularly when it is busy trying to care for the young. One further solution is that the government or social organizations establish some workplaces especially for the old where they are independent.

Unfortunately,as the present situation in our country shows,this is not a truly viable answer. The government can seldom afford to care for the old,particularly when it is busy trying to care for the young. One further solution is that the government or social organizations establish some workplaces especially for the old where they are independent. To sum up,all these options have advantages and disadvantages. Therefore,it is reasonable to expect that some combination of these options may be needed to provide the care we hope to give to the old generations.

The feast that has become known as the First Thanksgiving was actually a harvest festival celebrated in December of 1621. That's when English settlers in Plymouth, Massachusetts, gave thanks for the progress they had made after a harsh winter in their new country. Guests at outdoor tables gobbled   up ducks, geese turkeys, clams, eels, fish, wild plums, corn bread and other goodies. About 90 Native Americans also came and brought five deer to add to the feast. The festival lasted for three days. Thanksgiving customs spread and expanded along with the rest of America. After the American Revolution, George Washington proclaimed  that the first national Thanksgiving would be on November 26, 1789. In the decades to follow, however, people celebrate Thanksgiving locally and with no official date. A women's magazine editor named Sarah Josepha Hale wanted to change this. After years of trying hard to get support, she finally persuaded President Abraham Lincoln to proclaim the last Thursday in November 1863 as a national day of Thanksgiving. It stayed that way for 75 years afterward until 1939, when President Franklin D. Roosevelt set it one week earlier.

Now, thanks to a great invention called Scrubba Wash Pack, that worry may be a thing of the past. The portable washing machine was invented by Ash Newland in 2010, while planning to climb Mt. Kilimanjaro. Struck by the limited packing space, he got inspiration from traditional washboards to create a bag that could be used to clean clothes. Then he quitted his career as a lawyer and focused on perfecting the bag's design. By 2012, the bag was ready for the public. It weighed only 180 grams and required very little storage space, making it perfect for anyone wishing to travel light. Not surprisingly, the bag worth 55 dollars was an instant hit with travelers, university students and even passengers. However, Newland was not satisfied. He still saw a flaw with his invention - dirty clothes had to be carried around in a separate bag! The recently introduced Scrubba Wash Pack solves that problem. In order to make the pack active, dirty clothes are placed inside the bag along with two to three liters of water. The bag is then shut tightly to ensure all air is squeezed out and the clothes are massaged for a few minutes. After a quick wash, they are clean and ready to be dried. According to Newland, the pack can clean anything from jeans to smelly socks! What's even more amazing is that with a capacity to hold 13-liters of water, it can be used to wash more clothes at a time. The best part is that the 99-dollar pack that will be available for sale later this year, only weighs 300 grams and is completely foldable, making it easy to store when it's not in use.

Travis Treats from St.Louis University praisedThe King's Speech. He said it shows that \"how one's speech does not mean what one is inside\". He also added that people who stammer need to be heard and our society should recognize that they have a lot to give to the world. According to Norbert Lieckfeldt,  _  .", "subject": ""}

People with incomes below the poverty line are considered poor. Economists study the causes of poverty in order to find solutions to the problem. As the general standard of living in the country rises, the poverty line does, too. Therefore, even with today's  ly high standard of living, about 10 percent of the people in the United States are below the poverty line. However, if these people had stable jobs, they could have an acceptable standard of living. Economists suggest several reasons why poor people do not have jobs.  For one thing, more than half of the poor people in the United States are not qualified to work. Over 40 percent of the poor people are children. By law, children less than 16 years old cannot work in many industries. A large number of poor people are old. Many companies do not hire people over 65 years old the normal retirement age.  Some poor adults do not look for jobs for a variety of personal reasons: they are sick, they do not have any motivation, they have family problems, or they do not believe that they can find a job.  Other poor people look for a job but cannot find one. Many poor adults never went to high school. Therefore, when they look for jobs, they have few skills that they can offer.  At the present time, the government thinks it can reduce poverty in the country in the following ways.  First, if the national economy grows, businesses and industries hire more workers. Some of the poor who are qualified to look for jobs may find employment. Then they will no longer be below the poverty line.  Second, if society invests in the poor, the poor will become more productive. If the government spends money on social programs, education, and training for poor people, the poor will have the skills to offer. Then it is more likely that they can find jobs.  Finally, if the government distributes society's income differently, it raises some poor people above the poverty line. The government collects taxes from the non-poor and gives money to the poor. These payments to the poor are called welfare. Since 1975 over 18 million people in the United States have received welfare per year.

When he woke up , he had to listen to them over and over again. He was to keep hold of Kate's hand at all times , sit close to the front nearest the window , and tell the bus driver the name of his stop. Peter repeated all this back to his mother and set out for the bus stop with his sister. They held hands all the way. Actually he didn't mind this but simply hoped that none of his friends would see him holding a girl's hand. The bus came. They got on and sat close to the front. It was ridiculous sitting there holding hands and there were some boys from school there, so they let go of each other. Peter was feeling proud of himself. He could take care of his sister anywhere. If they were alone tighter on a mountain pass and came face to face with a pack of hungry wolves, he could know exactly what to do. Taking care and not to make sudden movement, he would move away with Kate until they had their backs to a large rock. That way the wolves would not be able to surround them. Then he takes from his pocket two important things--his hunting knife and a box of matches. He takes the knife from its sheath  and sets it down on the grass, ready in case the wolves attack. They're coming close now. They're so hungry and are watering and growling  . Kate is crying, but he cannot comfort her. He knows he has to concentrate on his plan. Right at their feet are some dry leaves and twigs. Quickly and skillfully, Peter gathers them into a small pile. The wolves are edging closer. He has to get this right. There's only one match left in the box. He bends down, cups his hand and lights the match. There's strong rush of wind. The flame flickers, but Peter holds it close to the pile and then first one leaf, then another, then the end of a twig catch fire, and soon the little pile is burning. He piles on more leaves and twigs and larger sticks. The wolves are backing off. Wild animals are terrified of fire.

A daydream like this could make him miss his stop if he wasn't careful. The bus had come to a halt. The kids from his school were already getting off. Peter leaped to his feet and just managed to jump to the pavement as the bus was starting off again. It was more than fifty yards down the road when he realized he had forgotten something.

In fact, her work inspired the creation of the Prize. The first American woman to win this prize was Jane Addams, in 1931. However, Addams is best known as the founder of Hull House. Jane Addams was born in I860, into a wealthy family. She was one of a small number of women in her generation to graduate from college. Her dedication to improving the lives of those around her led her to work for social reform and world peace. In the 1880s Jane Addams travelled to Europe. While she was in London, she visited a \"settlement house\" called Toynbee Hall. Inspired by Toynbee Hall, Addams and her friend, Ellen Gates Starr, opened Hull House in a neighborhood of slums in Chicago in 1899. Hull House provided a day care center for children of working mothers, a community kitchen, and visiting nurses. Addams and her staff gave classes in English literacy, art, and other subjects. Hull House also became a meeting place for clubs and labor unions. Most of the people who worked with Addams in Hull House were well educated, middle-class women. Hull House gave them an opportunity to use their education and it provided a training ground for careers in social work. Before World War I, Addams was probably the most beloved woman in America.

Replacing a keyboard or mouse, eye-scanning-cameras mounted on computers have become necessary tools for people without limbs or those affected with paralysis. The camera tracks the movement of the eye, allowing users to \"type\" on a virtual keyboard as they look at the screen. And now, researchers from the Cavendish Laboratory at prefix = st1 /CambridgeUniversitysay they have developed software that replaces the standard QWERTY keyboard layout with one that is nearly twice as efficient, more accurate and easier on the eyes. Called Dasher, the prototype program looks into the natural gaze of the eye and makes predictable words and phrases simpler to write. Any off-the-shelf camera capable of scanning eye movement can be used with Dasher, though the person must sit fairly still during the interaction.   The letters of the alphabet appear in a single column on the right of the screen, with an underline symbol to represent a space. Each letter is framed by a color1ed box. As the user looks at a particular letter on the right side of the screen and drags it to the left with their eye, another sub-alphabet column begins to emerge inside the box on the right-hand side, along with more letters framed in color1ed boxes. Dasher is designed to anticipate which letter will be needed, so although the successive sub-alphabet columns are initially very small, the letters or combination of letters that appear are most likely to be used next in that sequence. For example, if a person starts with the letter \"h\", the language models in Dasher will bring up \"a\" \"e\" \"i\" \"o\" and \"u\" in the sub-alphabet box, along with a few other possible combinations like \"ello\" to form the word \"hello\". Each box has a complete alphabet within it, though the first letters to appear have the highest probability of usage. The letters are then placed together to form a sentence on the left side of the screen.   Researchers say people will be able to write up to 25 words per minute with Dasher compared to on-screen keyboards, which they say average about 15 words per minute.

The rising number of English-learning pupils is mainly caused by social and cultural reasons. English is the most common spoken language in official and public life in South Africa, the survey reports. In April 2011, the leaders of higher education and training said that they would take some steps to improve the university teaching and prevent the continuing _ of African languages. They suggested that in future every South African university student could be required to learn at least one African language in order to complete their studies at school.

{"answer": 2, "choices": ["One", "Two", "Three", "Four"], "question": "\"San Francisco, open your Golden Gate,\" sang the girl in the theatre. She never finished her song. The date was 18th, 1906. The earth shook and the roof suddenly divided, buildings crashed to the ground and people rushed out into the streets. The dreadful earthquake destroyed the city that had grown up when men discovered gold in the deserts of California. But today the streets of San-Francisco stretch over more than 40 steep hills, rising like huge cliffs above the blue waters of the Pacific Ocean. The best way to see this splendid city, where Spanish were the first to make their homes, is to take one of the old cable cars which run along the nine main avenues. Fares are cheap; they have not risen for almost a hundred years. You leave the palm trees in Union Square -- the heart of San-Francisco and from the shop signs and the faces around you, you will notice that in the city live people from many nations -- Austrians, Italians, Chinese, and others, giving every part of the city a special character. More Chinese live in China Town than in any other part of the world outside China. Here, with Chinese restaurants, Chinese post-boxes, and even odd telephone-boxes that look like pagoda , it is easy to feel you are in China itself. Fisherman's Wharf, a place all foreigners want to see, is the end of the ride. You get out, and then set out to find a table in one of gay little restaurants beside the harbor. As you enjoy the fresh Pacific sea food, you can admire the bright red paint of the Golden Gate Bridge in the harbor and watch the traffic crossing beneath the tall towers on its way to the pretty village of Tiberon. When you finish your meal, you may decide to take a boat-trip around the bay to look at the sights. You can stare at the famous, now empty, prison of Alcatraz. Then why not go to the fishing village of Sansalito -- a little like London's Chelsea or New York's Greenwich Village--to see people painting and to look at their pictures. You will be able to enjoy a view of the city from the sea and take pleasure in the soft red and blue Spanish-type houses shining in the bright Pacific light.

The gestures were captured on a recognizer system designed by the team. Using this data, they tested the complexity and accuracy of each gesture using information theory. The result of their analysis is that people are favorable to use free - form gestures as passwords. To put their analysis into practice, the researchers then had seven students in computer science and engineering, each with considerable experience with touchscreens , attempt to steal a free - form gesture password by observing a phone user secretly. None of them were able to copy the gestures with enough accuracy. The gestures appear to be extremely powerful against attacks. Though the testing is in its early stage and widespread adaptation of this technology is not yet clear, the research team plans to continue to analyze the security and management of free - form passwords in the future. They believe this is the first study to explore free - form gestures as passwords. They will soon publish their findings. The main purpose of the text is to   _  .", "subject": ""}

It's an ambitious goal for a nation that will have a population of 1.5 billion by then.  Making healthcare affordable and easily available is the most important thing for many countries. But the task is much harder in China, the world's most populous nation. Gao Qiang, Vice Minister of Health, said, \"I think the goal of offering every Chinese basic healthcare is extremely large. It will be an arduous task. We have to make sure every citizen, including the huge rural  population, will be covered.\" But the size of the population is only one of many difficulties. Gao Qiang said, \"The most obvious problem right now is that many people have no easy access to medical care. We still have a considerable number of city and rural residents who have not joined any medical insurance system. Moreover, medical services are public welfare services. We need to stop those hospitals that make profit by selling medicine.\" China started to reform its healthcare system in the early 1990s. Today, it has extended medical insurance to 170 million city residents. A rural cooperative medical insurance system was launched in 2003 to offer farmers basic healthcare. So far, more than eighty percent of the rural population have participated in the insurance scheme. And this year, unemployed city residents and children will also be covered by the system.

When the knife cuts through the tri- tip, exposing the red meat bursting with juices, it's more than just cooking. It's a cultural event, showing we are at the top of the food chain, like no other food can. Nutritionally speaking, the tri-tip is one of the better cuts of beef. It is lower in fat than many other cuts, and the proteins   you get from eating meat are more complete than those that come from vegetables, making meat a better choice for building and keeping up your muscle tissue healthy. According to the National Center for Biotechnology Information, one thing to be aware of with soy products in general is that while they are high in iron, a necessary mineral for the body, they also contain something that blocks the body's absorption of iron. We can cook them in various ways to make them tasty. Anyway, the tri-tip goes a lot better with ice-cold beer than a large piece of bean-curd cheese would, no matter how you cook it.

Father Panna said, \"He's there every time I celebrate Mass and is very well behaved. He doesn't make a sound, and I've not heard one bark from him in all the time he has been in. He used to come with Maria and he was obviously devoted to her. I let him stay inside as he was always so well behaved and none of the other people ever complained to me. He's still coming to Mass even after Maria's funeral, he just sat there quietly. I didn't have the heart to throw him out. I've just recently lost my own dog so I leave him there until Mass finishes and then I let him out.\" Tommy's been adopted by everyone in the village now and he is everybody's friend. Everyone looks out for him and leaves food for him, although it would be nice to find a proper home for him. The story of Tommy is similar to the 2009 Hollywood filmHachiwhich told of how a faithful Akita dog waits patiently for his master after he also dies. It was based on the true story of a Japanese Akita called Hachi, whose owner died in 1925 but for the next nine years he waited patiently at the railway station for his owner from where they regularly caught a train.

Daddy sea horses can! This Father's Day, while you're praising your daddy, you may also remember that some of the best dads in the world can be found in the animal kingdom: Sea horses: The \"Mr. Moms\" in the sea, male sea horses, carry up to 2,000 fertilized eggs in small bags in their stomachs until _ hatch. Even after the babies are born, they stay inside the bag until they are ready to live by themselves. Darwin's rheas: Thought your dad was overprotective? Darwin's rheas, also known as South American ostriches  , are so protective of their children that they have even been known to attack small airplanes on the ground if they get too close to their home! Marmosets: These little monkeys do everything but give lectures on how to give birth! Devoted dads assist during their babies' birth. They also let Mom get some rest by taking care of the kids when she's not nursing them. Sand grouse: These pigeon-like birds live in areas where water is rare, so fathers fly as many as 50 miles to get water for their kids. After they dip their breast feathers in the water, they fly home and let their chicks suck the water from their bodies. Fathers in the animal kingdom are not that different from our own beloved dads.

After a good night's sleep a problem that couldn't be solved the night before can often appear more manageable. Researchers at the University of Luebek in Germany have designed an experiment that shows a good night's sleep can improve insight and problem-solving ability. \"If you have some newly-got memories in your brain, sleep acts on these memories and restructures them, so that after sleep the insight increases,\" said Dr Jan Born, a neuroscientist, at the University. To test the discovery, they taught volunteers two simple rules to help them turn a string of numbers into a new order. There was also a third, hidden rule, which could help them increase their speed in solving the problem. The researchers divided the volunteers into two groups: half were allowed to sleep after the training while the rest were forced to stay awake. Dr Jan Born and his team noticed that the group that had slept after the training were twice as likely to figure out the third rule as the other group. \"Sleep helped,\" Born said in a telephone interview . The important thing is that you have to have a memory description of the problem you want to solve in your brain and then you sleep, so it can act on the problem.\" But Born admitted that he and his team don't know how restructuring of memories occurs or what controls it. Pierre Maquet and Perrine Ruby of the University of Liege in Belgium said the experimental evidence supports the suggestion that sleep can help develop creative thinking. Although the role of sleep in human creativity will still be a mystery, the research gives people good reasons to fully respect their periods of sleep, they added.

Even in ancient times, we used fire to frighten away animals, built simple boats to cross waters, and armed ourselves with sharpening stones and sticks. Nowadays, with advanced technology and instrument, people know the world better than ever. It's surprising how much people already know about this world and how much we've changed our lives by using the knowledge we have. But if you think we know everything, that's wrong. I guess sometimes we have to accept the limitation on our understanding of the world. No matter how much we're already known about the world, there are things that remain mysterious. I learned this from my pregnancy   which ended in the 6th month, due to a placental abruption  . I started to see my OB/GYN   every month, taking vitamins regularly, doing all the lab tests to make sure we were expecting a healthy baby. All the results looked promising, and we thought we would have a healthy baby girl in January next year. Even in the week before placental abruption, when I was in hospital because of a sudden bleeding, doctors didn't believe there were any bad possibilities after reading my blood tests. Unfortunately it still happened. Later, I asked my doctor \"So what caused this?\" She said, \"I don't know. We probably will never know.\" After leaving the hospital, I sometimes do feel frustrated for what happened. But I already accept the fact that there are simply things that we do not know. No matter how well you plan and monitor your life there are uncertainties that can not be predicted and thus can not be avoided. _  Her name was Janet. She came to the world in April, and left us 6 months later. Though we never had the chance of meeting her, she is always our beloved daughter. In the late May 2013, during our first OB visit, we saw a little heart beating happily inside its mother. We couldn't even tell that was a baby, but we knew the magic was happening. The first three months was a disaster, Janet showed her power by making her mama throw up every day. Daddy became the cook of the family, and spent hours learning new dishes to please his picky wife. In the 12th week, we saw her again during an OB screening. When the doctor tried to measure her, she suddenly waved her hand to us, as if saying \"I know you are spying on me again.\" Every regular OB check became our favorite experience, when we could hear her heart beating and knew she was enjoying herself. In the 18th week, one day when daddy was singing, she suddenly kicked her mama. We never felt so happy. Since then, she became more and more naughty, doing all sorts of exercise in her warm little house. We started to think about names, decorate her pink room, and shared the news with our friends. For young parents, there are always a lot to learn! Then it was the end of 25th week. A sudden bleeding terrified mama and daddy. After staying in the hospital for three days, things looked all right again, and Janet did not seem to be affected. However, the night after we went out of the hospital, a much worse contraction  started which caused placental abruption. When we went back to the hospital, mama survived from an emergency operation, but Janet's heart was no longer beating. Janet, thank you for all the joy you brought to us.

So it's important to know which freezer is right for your needs.    First, decide if you want an upright or chest model. Uprights are more convenient. Their storage space is more accessible and they take up less floor area. However, chest models are more energy-efficient because less cold air escapes when they are open.    If you are buying an upright, you'll have to choose between frostless  or manual  defrost . Chest freezers are always manual. Frostless freezers automatically defrost at present intervals  and remove the water. Manual models must be defrosted by hand every few months or whenever frost pile up to about a quarter of an inch.    To help your freezer reach a ripe old age, try to find a spot that's cool, dry, and away fromdrafts . Drafts and heat will raise the freezer's cabinet temperature, which makes it work harder to keep cool. That means wasted energy. That means wasted energy and a shortened life.    Dry air is important because highhumidity  can cause the freezer to rust outside and frost up inside. With proper care, a freezer can serve you for 15 years or more. Regular cleaning and simple maintenance will help it maintain a zero-degree temperature and keep it smelling fresh and looking almost new.

By 1914 young Einstein had been world-famous. He accepted the offer to become a professor at the Prussian Academy of Science in Berlin. He had few duties, little teaching and unlimited chances for study, but soon his peace and quiet life were broken by World War I.                Einstein hated fighting and killing. The great suffering of war affected him deeply, and he sat unhappily in his office doing little. He lost interest in his research. Only when peace came in 1918 was he able to get back to work. In the year following World War I honors were increasingly put on him. He became head of the Kaiser Whihem Institute of Theoretical Physics. But he himself refused the effort to put him in a position far above other people. He was well known for his humble manners. He often said that his success would certainly have been achieved by others if he had never lived. In 1921 he won the Nobel Prize, and he was honored in Germany until the rise of Nazism when he was driven from Germany because he was a Jew.www.ks5u.com In the years following the First World War,   _  .", "subject": ""}

One showed that adults are much more cooperative if they work in a system based on rewards. Researchers at Harvard University in the United States and the Stockholm School of Economics in Sweden did the study. They had about two hundred college students play a version of the game known as the Prisoner's Dilemma. The game is based on the tension   between the interests   of an individual and a group. The students played in groups of four. Each player could win points for the group, so they would all gain equally. But each player could also reward or punish each of the other three players, at a cost to the punisher. Harvard researcher David Rand says the most successful behavior proved to be cooperation. The groups that rewarded it the most earned about twice as much in the game as the groups that rewarded it the least. And the more a group punished itself, the lower its earnings were. The group with the most punishment earned twenty-five percent less than the group with the least punishment. The study appeared last month in the journal Science. The other study involved children. It was presented last month in California at a conference on violence and abuse. Researchers used intelligence tests given to two groups. More than eight hundred children aged two to four the first time they were tested. More than seven hundred children aged five to nine. The two groups were retested four years later, and the study compared the results with the first test. Both groups contained children whose parents used physical punishment and children whose parents did not. The study says the IQs--or intelligence quotients--of the younger children who were not _ were five points higher than those who were. In the older group, the difference was almost three points. Murray Strauss from the University of New Hampshire worked with Mallie Paschall from the Pacific Institute for Research and Evaluation. Professor Strauss has written extensively about physical punishment of children. He says the more they are spanked, the slower their mental development. He also looked at average IQs in other nations and found them lower where spanking was more common. Which could be the best title of the passage?", "subject": ""}

Point \"X\" is the very maximum anyone can learn in the day. And this represents the optimum , the best, amount of work to do.

If you try to ignore it and press yourself to work past the optimum, you will only get on this downward slope and achieve less than the best - and then become very tired and lose your power of concentration.

Newspapers tell readers what happened, and they also help readers understand what caused an event and how it will affect the world around them. The workers at large newspaper companies work under a lot of pressure to bring news to readers as soon as possible. Reporters, photographers, artists, and editors collect articles in just a few hours. Page designers select articles, photos, advertisements, and eye-catching headlines to make the pages, and then rush their work to the printer. Printing workers may work overnight around printing presses to _ more than 60,000 copies per hour. We can infer everything from the passage EXCEPT that   _  .", "subject": ""}

One reason they may feel that way is that coffee contains caffeine . Caffeine occurs naturally in coffee, tea, and cocoa beans, which are used to make chocolate. But now food makers are adding it to many products, from potato chips to water. The US government is especially worried about the problem. That's why the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) is studying the health effects of caffeine on young people. Studies show that too much caffeine can make people nervous and unable to sleep. What's more, caffeine is habit-forming. Those who consume it regularly and stop suddenly may experience headaches and feel tired. One of the biggest concerns is the large amount of caffeine added to so-called energy drinks, like Red Bull. A 12-ounce can of cola has about 35 milligrams of caffeine. A similar serving of Red Bull contains more than three times that amount. The Institute of Medicine is also working on caffeine-safety measures. \"Teenagers should not drink beverages that contain caffeine. They should be aware of caffeine's effects on health and on how the brain works. Take, for example, teenagers who consume caffeine to stay awake and study for a test. They will remember less of what they just studied,\" said Stallings, a member of the institute. Companies that make products with added caffeine claim they do not advertise them to kids. However, there is no law to stop children from buying them. So the FDA needs to set limits on caffeine, especially in energy drinks. As for added caffeine in foods, the government should just say no. If not, the amount of caffeine should be printed on food labels to remind consumers. The government must do that. Doctors say kids should avoid caffeine. If you need extra energy, try these natural boosters: eat right, exercise, and get plenty of sleep. What is the US government particularly concerned about?", "subject": ""}

Turn the car off instead of letting it run when it is stopped.  Idling uses more gas and sets free carbon dioxide into the air,        Reuse, recycle and compost (... ) your waste. It takes much less energy to reuse or recycle a product than to make a new one.  Correctly composting your food and yard waste removes the methane   that they would cause at the landfill site. Buying less is al- ways the best.  Plant trees. Trees take in carbon dioxide, reduce pollution, provide shade, and look great. The purpose of this text is to call on people   _", "subject": ""}
{"answer": 3, "choices": ["Exercise ---- Refresh you", "Exercise ---- Look slim", "Exercise ---- Live longer", "Exercise ---- Learn faster"], "question": "It is common sense that children who walk or cycle to school have a lower risk of obesity than those by car. But driving your youngsters to the gates could also cause their academic work to suffer. Researchers found children who were driven to school, or who took public transport, had poorer concentration levels than those who took a more active route such as walking or cycling. The joint study by researchers at two Danish universities found the regular exercise could advance a student up to half a year in their studies. Children who were driven to school, or who took public transport, performed less well in a test measuring concentration levels, than those who had walked or cycled. The results surprised the researchers, as their hypothesis  originally focused on the effects of eating breakfast and lunch on pupils' ability to concentrate. \"The exercise one uses to transport oneself to school is reflected in the level of concentration one has about four hours later,\" Niels Egelund, a co- author of the report said. \"The results showed that having breakfast and lunch has an impact, but not very much compared to having exercise.\" \"As a third-grade pupil, if you exercise and bike to school, your ability to concentrate increases to the equivalent of someone half a year further in their studies,\" he added. In the survey, taken by 19, 527 pupils aged five to 19 years old, participants were asked about their exercise habits and were then given a basic test measuring their concentration. \"Most people know the feeling of being refreshed after having exercised, but it is surprising that the effect lasts for so long,\" Egelund said. Previous research from the university of Montreal has found that exercise helps our brains make better use of oxygen. It may also reduce mental fatigue  and sharpen your thinking in between gym sessions. And last week Swedish researchers said they found that muscular boys will live longer than their weaker friends. And even if they are overweight by the time they get to adulthood, those with stronger muscles tend to live longer. What is the best title of this passage?", "subject": ""}

{"answer": 1, "choices": ["Knowledge.", "Action.", "Green living.", "Psychological distance."], "question": "Monty Hempel is a professor of environmental sciences at Redlands University in California. He studies ecological literacy--or ecoliteracy, for short. Ecoliteracy is the ability to think about and understand the natural processes that make life possible. Monty Hempel says ecoliteracy gives people knowledge about environmental problems. But he says it does not always work to get them to change their behavior. Mr. Hempel wrote part of the Worldwatch Institute's latest State of the World report. He says in his article, \"Some people think that ecoliteracy is just a green form of science literacy. And what I have tried to ask is whether that's enough. In other words, what an ecologically-literate person needs to know might include things like the cycles and the flows, the energy systems, all of those kind of things that we would call the science of ecology. \" \"That doesn't seem to lead to action to protect our environment--to protect our life-support system to the level that we need to. Just because we know a lot about the environment doesn't mean that we actually act to save it.

He studies ecological literacy--or ecoliteracy, for short. Ecoliteracy is the ability to think about and understand the natural processes that make life possible. Monty Hempel says ecoliteracy gives people knowledge about environmental problems. But he says it does not always work to get them to change their behavior. Mr. Hempel wrote part of the Worldwatch Institute's latest State of the World report. He says in his article, \"Some people think that ecoliteracy is just a green form of science literacy. And what I have tried to ask is whether that's enough. In other words, what an ecologically-literate person needs to know might include things like the cycles and the flows, the energy systems, all of those kind of things that we would call the science of ecology. \" \"That doesn't seem to lead to action to protect our environment--to protect our life-support system to the level that we need to.

Why plants always seem to turn, towards the light and climbing plants run up rather than down? The answer is simple:auxin,a chemical substance that controls growth in plants.       Auxin gives away its secrets Auxin is a plant hormone . Darwin was already interested in it in the 19th century. Only in recent years, however, has the hormone started to give away its secrets ,thanks to intensive molecular research.Auxin is produced in the young,growing parts of plants and then transported throughout the plant-to a low -lying stem for example. The stem needs to straighten out as soon as possible to be able to absorb the topside,resulting in the underside growing faster and the stem straightening out. For the same reason, plants in front of windows will always turn to the light . This active regulation of auxin transport allows plants to take ideal advantage of local and changing conditions.    A new means of transport for auxin?    The transport of auxin through the plant plays a vital role. And ,from all appearances,it is not a  simple matter. The researchers identified an important new link and means of transport for auxin: PILS proteins  . PILS proteins are vital for auxin-dependent plant growth and adjust the intracellular storage of the hormone. It is exactly this compartmentalizing   of auxin that seems functionally important for the various developmental processes.      Growing crops more efficiently: the right amount of auxin in the right place      Higher auxin levels at the right moment and in the right place result in better growth and greater harvest. Better adjustment of auxin levels would make plants grow more efficiently. The researchers hope to contribute to the development of more efficient growing processes by continuing to sort out auxin transport processes.

Without love a person could go hayward and also become cruel and ferocious. In the early stage of our life, our parents are the ones who shower us with unconditional love and care, they teach us about what is right and wrong, good and bad. But we always tend to take this for granted. It is only after marriage and having kids that a person understands and becomes sensitive to others feelings. Kids make a person responsible and mature and help us to understand life better. Happiness and sorrow Materialistic happiness is short-lived, but happiness achieved by bringing a smile on others face gives a certain level of fulfillment. Peace of mind is the main link to happiness. No mind is happy without peace. We realize the true worth of happiness when we are in sorrow. Sorrow is basically due to death of a loved one, failure and despair. But these things are temporary and pass away. Failure and success Failure is the path to success. It helps us to touch the sky, teaches us to survive and shows us a specific way. Success brings in money, fame, pride and self-respect. Here it becomes very important to keep our head on out shoulder. The only way to show our gratitude to god for bestowing success on us is by being humble, modest, courteous and respectful to the less fortunate ones. Hope and despair Hope is what keeps life going.

But when they asked, the only response which they got was that \"rules are rules.\" Not satisfied, the teens decided to explore the issue themselves.  For their new study, Ashleigh and Leah, seniors at Willcox High School in Willcox, Arizona., borrowed materials from the hospital where they had been trained as nursing assistants. Ten nurses there agreed to give them little scrapings off the top side of their nails. Half of the participants had natural nails. The other half wore nail polish or fake nails on top of their natural nails. The teens grew bacteria from the scrapings on plates; these are plastic dishes with a gel   that feeds bacterial growth. Natural nails produced an average of 4.3 bacterial colonies. In contrast, scrapings from nail polish or artificial nails produced an average of 17.5 colonies! Leah and Ashleigh had their answer to the question. Only natural nails are allowed because polished or artificial nails tend to harbor far more bacteria. The germs could be dangerous to sick patients.  Leah notes that they are not the first to look at nails in a medical setting. Still, she says, \"It is something that should be taken much more seriously than it is.\" To emphasize that, she points to the large list of similar studies she and Ashleigh uncovered during their research.

Their nails might look nice, but this might contribute to the large numbers of germs that hang onto their nails. Ashleigh has never really liked nail polish, so she will not have to change much to pursue her dream of being a surgeon.

Still, she says, \"It is something that should be taken much more seriously than it is.\" To emphasize that, she points to the large list of similar studies she and Ashleigh uncovered during their research. When nurses touch patients, they often wear gloves, but many small tasks are performed bare-handed. The teens hope to raise awareness of how dangerous artificial nails can be in the medical setting. \"What shocked me,\" Leah says, \"is how unconcerned some of the nurses were. They did not think their nails were dangerous.\" Ashleigh agrees and observes that to preserve their manicures  , nurses with polish or fake nails tended to scrub   less vigorously when washing their hands. Their nails might look nice, but this might contribute to the large numbers of germs that hang onto their nails. Ashleigh has never really liked nail polish, so she will not have to change much to pursue her dream of being a surgeon. But the results have reminded Leah, who wants to be a nurse, to give up her artificial nails for good. \"They are very pretty,\" she says, \"I love them.\" But now that she knows the risks they can cause, she admits that for a health professional they just are \"not worth it.\" We can know from the passage that Ashleigh Fraser     .", "subject": ""}

At the underside of the shelf there lives a small fish, the Antarctic cod. For forty years scientists have been curious about that fish. How does it live where most fish would freeze to death? It must have some secret. The Antarctic is not a comfortable place to work and research has been slow. Now it seems we have an answer. Research was begun by cutting holes in the ice and catching the fish. Scientists studied the fish's blood and measured its freezing point. The fish were taken from seawater that had a temperature of -1.88degC and many tiny pieces of ice floating in it. The blood of the fish did not begin to freeze until its temperature was lowered to -2.05degC. That small difference is enough for the fish to live at the freezing temperature of the ice-salt mixture. The scientists' next research job was clear: Find out what in the fish's blood kept it from freezing. Their search led to some really strange thing made up of a protein never before seen in the blood of a fish. When _ was removed, the blood froze at seawater temperature. When it was put back, the blood again had its antifreeze quality and a lowered freezing point. Study showed that it is an unusual kind of protein. It has many small sugar molecules held in special positions within each big protein molecule. Because of its sugar content, it is called a glycoprotein. So it has come to be called the antifreeze fish glycoprotein. Or AFGP. What is the text mainly about?", "subject": ""}

In the early 1970's, a New York City mailman used to travel across the city on the buses and subways to deliver his mail. He dreamt of riding on all the buses and subways in New York.

The artificial leaf developed by Daniel Nocera and his colleagues at MIT can be seen as a special silicon chip with catalysts . Similar to natural leaves, it can split water into hydrogen and oxygen when put into a bucket of water. The hydrogen and oxygen gases are then stored in a fuel cell, using those two materials to produce electricity, located either on top of a house or beside the house.    Though the leaf is shaped like a poker card, scientists stated that it is promising to be an inexpensive somtoe of electricity in developing countries. \"One can imagine villages in India and Africa not long from now purchasing an affordable basic power system based on this technology,\" said an American scientist, Docera.   An artificial leaf is not a new idea. The first artificial leaf was invented in 1997 but too expensive and unstable for practical use. The new leaf, however, is made of cheap materials, easy to use and highly stable. In laboratory studies, Nocera showed that an artificial leaf could operate continuously for at least 45 hours.

{"answer": 1, "choices": ["was extremely wise and noble", "admired the Miller very much", "was highly valued by the Miller", "had a strong desire for fortune"], "question": "Hans was an honest fellow with a funny round good-humored face. Living alone, every day he worked in his garden. In all the countryside there was no garden so lovely as his. All sorts of flowers grew there, blooming in their proper order as the months went by, one flower taking another flower's place, so that there were always beautiful things to see, and pleasant odors to smell. Hans had many friends, the most devoted being the Miller. So devoted was the rich Miller to Hans that he'd never go by his garden without plucking a large bunch of flowers or a handful of sweet herbs, or filling his pockets with fruits. The Miller used to talk about noble ideas, and Hans nodded and smiled, feeling proud of having such a friend. The neighbors thought it strange that the rich Miller never gave Hans anything in return, though he had hundreds of sacks of flour, many cows and sheep, but Hans never troubled his head about these, and nothing gave him greater pleasure than to listen to all the wonderful things about the unselfishness of true friendship. In spring, summer, and autumn Hans was very happy, but when winter came, and he had no fruit or flowers to sell, he suffered from cold and hunger. Though extremely lonely, the Miller never came to see him then. \"There's no good in going to see Hans while the snow lasts.\" The Miller said to his wife, \"When people are in trouble they shouldn't be bothered. So I'll wait till the spring comes when he's happy to give me flowers.\" \"You're certainly very thoughtful,\" answered his wife, \"It's quite a treat to hear you talk about friendship.\" \"Couldn't we ask Hans up here?\" said their son. \"I'll give him half my meal, and show him my white rabbits.\" \"How silly you are!\" cried the Miller. \"I really don't know what's the use of sending you to school. If Hans came up here, and saw our warm fire, our good supper, and our red wine, he might get envious, and envy is a most terrible thing, and would spoil anybody's nature. I am his best friend, and I'll always watch over him, and see that he's not led into any temptation. Besides, if Hans came here, he might ask me for some flour. Flour is one thing, and friendship is another, and they shouldn't be confused. The words are spelt differently, and mean quite different things. Everybody can see that.\" He looked seriously at his son, who felt so ashamed that he hung his head down, and grew quite scared, and began to cry into his tea. Spring coming, the Miller went down to see Hans. Again he talked about friendship. \"Hans, friendship never forgets. I'm afraid you don't understand the poetry of life. See, how lovely your roses are!\" Hans said he wanted to sell them in the market to buy back his things which were sold during the hard time of the winter. \"I'll give you many good things. I think being generous is the base of friendship.\" said the Miller. \"And now, as I'll give you many good things, I'm sure you'd like to give me some flowers in return. Here's the basket, and fill it quite full.\" Poor Hans was afraid to say anything. He ran and plucked all his pretty roses, and filled the Miller's basket, imagining the many good things promised by the Miller. The next day he heard the Miller calling: \"Hans, would you mind carrying this sack of flour for me to market?\" \"I'm sorry, but I am really very busy today.\" \"Well,\" said the Miller, \"considering that I'm going to give you my things, it's rather unfriendly of you to refuse. Upon my word, you mustn't mind my speaking quite plainly to you.\" Poor Hans was driven by his friendship theory to work hard for his best friend, leaving his garden dry and wasted. One evening Hans was sitting by fire when the Miller came. \"Hans,\" cried the Miller, \"My little boy has fallen off a ladder and hurt himself, and I'm going for the Doctor. But he lives so far away, and it's such a bad windy night. It has just occurred to me that you can go instead of me. You know I'm going to give you my good things, so you should do something for me in return.\" \"Certainly,\" cried Hans. He struggled into the stormy night, and got the doctor to ride a horse to the Miller's house in time to save the boy. However, Hans got lost in the darkness, and wandered off into a deep pool, drowned. At Hans' funeral, the Miller said, \"I was his best friend. I should walk at the head of the procession.\" Every now and then he wiped his eyes with a handkerchief. From the passage, we can learn that Hans   _  .", "subject": ""}

So I'll wait till the spring comes when he's happy to give me flowers.\" \"You're certainly very thoughtful,\" answered his wife, \"It's quite a treat to hear you talk about friendship.\" \"Couldn't we ask Hans up here?\" said their son. \"I'll give him half my meal, and show him my white rabbits.\" \"How silly you are!\" cried the Miller. \"I really don't know what's the use of sending you to school. If Hans came up here, and saw our warm fire, our good supper, and our red wine, he might get envious, and envy is a most terrible thing, and would spoil anybody's nature. I am his best friend, and I'll always watch over him, and see that he's not led into any temptation. Besides, if Hans came here, he might ask me for some flour. Flour is one thing, and friendship is another, and they shouldn't be confused. The words are spelt differently, and mean quite different things. Everybody can see that.\" He looked seriously at his son, who felt so ashamed that he hung his head down, and grew quite scared, and began to cry into his tea. Spring coming, the Miller went down to see Hans. Again he talked about friendship. \"Hans, friendship never forgets. I'm afraid you don't understand the poetry of life. See, how lovely your roses are!\" Hans said he wanted to sell them in the market to buy back his things which were sold during the hard time of the winter. \"I'll give you many good things. I think being generous is the base of friendship.\" said the Miller. \"And now, as I'll give you many good things, I'm sure you'd like to give me some flowers in return. Here's the basket, and fill it quite full.\" Poor Hans was afraid to say anything. He ran and plucked all his pretty roses, and filled the Miller's basket, imagining the many good things promised by the Miller. The next day he heard the Miller calling: \"Hans, would you mind carrying this sack of flour for me to market?\" \"I'm sorry, but I am really very busy today.\" \"Well,\" said the Miller, \"considering that I'm going to give you my things, it's rather unfriendly of you to refuse. Upon my word, you mustn't mind my speaking quite plainly to you.\" Poor Hans was driven by his friendship theory to work hard for his best friend, leaving his garden dry and wasted. One evening Hans was sitting by fire when the Miller came. \"Hans,\" cried the Miller, \"My little boy has fallen off a ladder and hurt himself, and I'm going for the Doctor. But he lives so far away, and it's such a bad windy night. It has just occurred to me that you can go instead of me.

He struggled into the stormy night, and got the doctor to ride a horse to the Miller's house in time to save the boy.

A message gets passed from person to person, and everyone laughs at how distorted  it becomes. As a game, telephone can be fun. In real life, sending messages through third parties fouls things up. It is important for family members who have \"business\" with other family members to take it up directly. When tension arises in a relationship between two people, a frequent way of dealing with this is to send messages through a third person. Family doctors refer to the process as 'triangulation\". Following a quarrel, a mother may say to her son, \"Tell your father to pass the salt\", which may be answered by, \"Tell your mother to get her own salt.\" In many long cases of triangulation, the middleman becomes severely disturbed. Two years ago, Ruth and Ralph Gordon brought their 17-year-old daughter for treatment. Lucille was not doing well in school, using drugs heavily. When I began to work with her, she was uncommunicative and aggressive. After some time, however, she opened up and told me her parents rarely talked to each other, but both used her as a middleman. Mrs. Gordon was sexually unsatisfied and suggested to Lucille that she ask her father to go for marriage advice. Mr. Gordon told Lucille that he was seeing another woman, and he urged Lucille to speak to her mother about improving her behaviour. Caught in this confusing situation, Lucille became more and more troubled. It wasn't until she refused to play middleman that she began to improve. When either parent began to send a message through her, she learned to say, \"Tell him/her yourself!\" You'll find that when family members learn to dial each other directly, there's rarely a busy signal or wrong number. With direct dialing, a sense of freshness is created. Through the example of Lucille and her parents, the writer hopes to tell the readers that   _  .", "subject": ""}

Children, for example, benefit from being told jokes and encouraged to laugh, although some children's jokes might seem rather strange to adults. If you have children, try to encourage them to tell jokes and think about what makes things funny. And it will help them develop a sense of humor.

Ten years ago, when the first Newsweek Top School List based on college-level test participation was published, only three of the top 100 schools had graduating classes smaller than 100 students. This year there are 22. Fifty years ago, they were the latest thing in educational reform: big, modern high schools outside the cities with thousands of students. Big schools meant economic efficiency, a greater choice of courses, and better football teams. But only years later did we understand that it involved the difficulty of strengthening personal connections between teachers and students. SAT scores began dropping; on average, 30% of students did not complete high school in four years, a figure that rose to 50% in poor city neighborhoods. High schools for a variety of reasons seemed to have made little progress. Size isn't everything, but it does matter, and the past decade has seen a noticeable trend toward smaller schools. This has been partly due to the Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation, which has invested $1.8 billion in American high schools, helping to open about 1,000 small schools -- most of them with about 400 kids, each with an average enrollment of only 150 students per grade. About 500 more are on the drawing board. Districts all over the country are taking notice, along with mayors in cities like New York, Chicago and San Diego. And most noticeable of all, there is the phenomenon of large urban and suburban high schools that have split up into smaller units of a few hundred. Hillsdale High School in San Mateo, California, is one of those ranking No.423 -- among the top 2% in the country. In 2003, Hillsdale remade itself into three \"houses\". 300 students arriving ninth graders are randomly assigned to one of the houses, where they will keep the same four core subject teachers for two years before moving on to another for 11th and 12th grades.

Ranking schools is always controversial. Over the years this system has been criticized for its simplicity -- list of top U.S. high schools was made merely according to the proportion of students taking college-level exams.

The advisers also meet with students privately and stay in touch with parents. Along with the new structure came the percentage of freshmen taking biology jumped from 17 to 95.\"It was rough for some. But by senior year, two-thirds have moved up to physics,\" says Jeff Gilbert. \"Our kids are coming to school in part because they know there are adults here who know them and care for them.\" But not all schools show advances after downsizing, and it remains to be seen whether smaller schools will be a cure-all solution. Ranking schools is always controversial. Over the years this system has been criticized for its simplicity -- list of top U.S. high schools was made merely according to the proportion of students taking college-level exams. This year a group of 38 superintendents   from five states wrote to ask that their schools should be excluded from the calculation. \"It is impossible to know which high schools are 'the best' in the nation,\" their letter read. \"Determining whether different schools do or don't offer a high quality of education requires a look at many different measures, including students' overall academic accomplishments, their later performance in college, and taking into consideration the unique needs of their communities.\" Which of the following can be the best title for the passage?", "subject": ""}

While other kids ate candy for breakfast, I had to have cereal, eggs or toast. While others had Cokes and candy for lunch, I had to eat a sandwich. As you can guess, my supper was different from the other kids' too. But at least, I wasn't alone in my sufferings. My sister and two brothers had the same mean mother as I did. My mother insisted upon knowing where we were at all times. She had to know who our friends were and where we were going. She insisted if we said we'd be gone an hour, then we should be gone one hour or less -- not one hour and one minute. And she always insisted upon us telling the truth. Now you can see how mean she was. The worst is yet to come. We had to be in bed by nine each night and up at eight the next morning. We couldn't sleep till noon like our friends. So while they slept - my mother actually had the courage to break the Child Labor Law. She made us work. We had to wash dishes, make beds, and learn to cook. We had to wear clean clothes and take a bath every day. The other kids always wore their clothes for days. We reached the height of disgrace because she made our clothes herself, just to save money. I believe she laid awake at night thinking up mean things to do to us. Through the years, things didn't improve a bit. We could not lie in bed \"sick\" like our friends did, and miss school. Our marks in school had to live up to expectations. Our friends' report cards had beautiful colors on them, black for passing, red for failing. My mother, being as different as she was, would be satisfied with nothing less than ugly black marks. As the years rolled by, first one and then the other of us was put to shame.

From the ancient Greeks and Romans to current day writers and professors, the debate about happiness continues. What makes someone happy? In what parts of the world are people the happiest? Why even study happiness? The Greek philosopher Aristotle said that a person's highest happiness comes from the use of his or her intelligence. Religious books such as the Koran and Bible discuss faith as a form of happiness. The British scientist Charles Darwin believed that all species were formed in a way so as to enjoy happiness. People throughout history may have had different ideas about happiness. But today, many people are still searching for its meaning. How do you study something like happiness? You could start with the World Database of Happiness at Erasmus University in prefix = st1 /Rotterdam, The Netherlands. This set of information includes how to define and measure happiness. Some findings are not surprising. For example, the database suggests that married people are happier than single people. People who like to be with other people are happier than unsocial people. But other findings are less expected: People with children are equally happy as couples without children. And wealthier people are only a little happier than poorer people. Positive psychology is the new term for a method of scientific study that tries to examine the things that make life worth living instead of life's problems. Traditional psychology generally studies negative situations like mental suffering and sickness. But positive psychology aims to study the strengths that allow people and communities to do well. There is also an increasing amount of medical research on the physical qualities of happiness.

Some people object to cloning because it allows scientists to \"act like God\" in the handling of living organisms.     The cloning of Dolly raised the debate over this practice to a whole new level. It has become obvious that the technology for cloning Dolly could also be used to clone humans. A person could choose to make two or ten or a hundred copies of himself or herself by the same techniques used with Dolly. An active debate about the morality of cloning humans arises. Some people see benefits from the practice, such as providing a way for parents to produce a new child to replace one dying of a fatal disease. Other people worry about humans taking into their own hands the future of the human race.     At the beginning of the twenty-first century, many scientists say the controversy over the ethics of cloning humans is overstressed because of the unpredictability   of cloning in general. While scientists have cloned animals such as sheep, mice, cows, pigs, and goats, fewer than 3 percent of all those cloning efforts have succeeded. The animal clones that have been produced often have health problems. Scientists believe the rapid reprogramming in cloning can introduce random   errors into a clone's DNA. Those errors have altered individual genes in minor ways, and the genetic defects   have led to the development of major medical problems. Some scientists say this should make human cloning out of the question, but others argue that cloning humans may actually be easier and safer than cloning animals. Whatever, I agree that further research in the field of cloning is needed. The text is mainly about   _  .", "subject": ""}

But there's no doubt that Friends has become more than just a successful situation comedy--it has established itself as one of the last great television phenomena of the last century. Along the way, it has made its half-dozen leading actors famous. Looking back on the strong friendship between the group of three men and three women who frequently gather at each other's apartments and at Greenwich Village's Central Perk coffee house, Friends was created by television producers, David Crane and Marta Kauffman. In 1993, the pair met producer Kevin S. Bright. Then the three became partners and got a deal to produce a new comedy for Warner Brothers. What they came up with was based on Crane and Kauffman's after-college years, when they hung out at the local coffee house and involved themselves in every aspect of each other's lives. It didn't take long for viewers to make friends with Friends. The situation comedy quickly became a top ten hit. Critics loved it as well. Entertainment Weekly said the show operated like a Broadway show, with twisty plots and unique jokes. The television theme song has also been a success with the public. The song's success helped save the television theme song. An ABC executive was ready to order very short music intros  on his network's shows, thinking that viewers would hit the remote control as soon as the opening started. But the success of the Friends theme song led the ABC executive to change his mind-- remote controls or not, the TV theme song would stay. Years have gone by, but Friends remains and will remain an example of a modern US situation comedy that is both hugely entertaining television and nothing short of a genuine latter-day social phenomenon.

According to Gerald Crabtree, a scientist at Stanford University in the US, we are. You may not want to hear this, but Crabtree believes that human intelligence reached its peak more than 2,000 years ago and ever since then has been going downhill. \"If an average Greek from 1,000 BC were transported to modern times, he or she would be one of the brightest among us,\" Crabtree told The Guardian. At the heart of Crabtree's thinking is a simple idea. In the past, intelligence was critical for survival when our ancestors had to avoid dangerous animals and hunt for food. The difference of being smart or stupid is often life or death. However, after the spread of agriculture, when our ancestors began to live in dense farming communities, the need to keep their intelligence in peak condition gradually reduced. This is not hard to understand. Most of the time, pressure is what keeps us going - you need the pressure from your teachers to finish your homework; the pressure of looking pretty prompts  you to lose weight when summer comes. And the same is also true of our intelligence - if we think less, we become less smart. These mutations  are harmful to our intelligence and they were all developed in the past 3,000 years. The other evidence that Crabtree holds is in our genes. He found that among the 2,000 to 5,000 genes that we have that determine human intelligence , there are two or more mutations in each of us. However, Crabtree's theory has been criticized by some who say that early humans may have better hunting and surviving abilities, but people today have developed a more diverse intelligence. For example, spearing a tiger doesn't necessarily require more brainpower than playing chess or writing a poem. Moreover, the power of modern education means a lot more people have the opportunity to learn nowadays. \"You wouldn't get Stephen Hawking 2,000 years ago.

We both have kids who play football in a football club, and someone has to take them to practice and pick them up. Sally and I and two other mothers take turns to do this. We meet sometimes and have tea and talk about what our kids are doing, but those are the only times that we meet each other. I enjoy being with these women, but we don't do anything else together. Another type is called the \"hobby friend\". That's the person you share an interest or a hobby with. Michael and Cater, who are brothers, are a good example of this type. We're all in a bird watching club. Every few weekends the members of the club go on a trip to watch different kinds of birds. There's nothing romantic about my relationship with Michael and Cater, of course. We just share interest in birds. Then there's the \"other half of the couple\" type of friends.

Since it is harder to move quickly on sand than a hard ground, play will be much slower than regular volleyball on a playground. When a player trains for beach volleyball, he will focus on building lower body strength as well as upper body.

Let's find out what American students do in school.     An official dance party is held about twice a year in high schools in the United States. When the final football game is over for the season there is a homecoming party. Sometimes, students select a king from among the football players, and a queen from among the girls. Every student can attend and have fun with the help of their teachers. Sometimes, students, called bookworms, to the surprise of the other students, come to the party in a beautiful dress.     The most exciting party that students can go to would have to be a dance party.

{"answer": 1, "choices": ["negative", "positive", "neutral", "realistic"], "question": "In our culture, the sources of what we call a sense of \"mastery\" - feeling important and worthwhile - and the sources of what we call a sense of \"pleasure\" - finding life enjoyable - are not always the same. Women often are told \"You can't have it all.\" Sometimes what the speaker really is saying is: \"You chose a career, so you can't expect to have closer relationships or a happy family life.\" or \"You have a wonderful husband and children--What's all this about wanting a career?\" But women need to understand and develop both aspects of well-being, if they are to feel good about themselves. Our study shows that, for women, well-being has two dimensions. One is mastery, which includes self-esteem, a sense of control over your life, and low levels of anxiety and depression. Mastery is closely related to the \"doing\" side of life, to work and activity. Pleasure is the other dimensions, and it is composed of happiness, satisfaction and optimism. It is tied more closely to the \"feeling\" side of life. The two are independent of each other. A woman could be high in mastery and low in pleasure, and vice versa . For example, a woman who has a good job, but whose mother has just died, might be feeling very good about herself and in control of her work life, but the pleasure side could be damaged for a time. The concepts of mastery and pleasure can help us identify the sources of well-being for women, and remedy past mistakes. In the past, women were encouraged to look only at the feeling side of life as the source of all well-being. But we know that both mastery and pleasure are critical. And mastery seems to be achieved largely through work. In our study, all the groups of employed women rated significantly higher in mastery than did women who were not employed.

{"answer": 3, "choices": ["ab", "ac", "bc", "ad"], "question": "According to a handful of studies, a name not only reveals clues about a person's class, education and ethnic  origin, it can also influence the bearer of the name and the choices they make in life. Scientists have even drawn conclusions to suggest that people are often drawn to things and people that sound like their own names. These experts claim that 'implicit egotism'  is the reason that someone called Dennis might become a dentist or even that a child whose name begins with a B or C may perform worse in school examinations. That a person's name may be bound to his or her destiny is far from a new phenomenon. The Ancient Romans promoted the concept 'nomenest omen', meaning 'name is destiny.' Studies have indeed shown that those with more conservative names are more successful when applying for a job. And a recent survey conducted in Australia revealed that people respond more warmly to colleagues and politicians with names they can easily pronounce. Yet parents nowadays are putting that much more effort into giving their children original names that are largely unfamiliar. Though historically names from the Bible have been passed down through families, in recent days the tendency has been to think outside the box and consider movies, songs and stories for inspiration. When Britney Spears rose to fame the slightly altered Brittaney became wildly popular among new parents and recently, thanks to the Twilight series, Isabella has made a comeback. One study found that 30 percent of African American girls born in California during the 1990s were given unique names that they shared with not a single person born in the same year in the same state. Dr Martin Ford of George Mason University, however, believes a name does not stand for much. He explained to The Week: 'Names only have a significant influence when that is the only thing you know about the person. Add a picture, and the impact of the name weakens. Add information about personality, motivation, and ability, and the impact of the name shrinks   to minimal significance.'

Americail is informal and chatty. It's likely to begin with a \"Hi\" and end with a \"Bye\". The chances of Amerimail containing a smiley face or an \"xoxo\" are disturbingly high. We Americans are unwilling to dive into the meat of an e-mail. We feel we have to first inform recipients   about our vacation on the island which was really excellent except the jellyfish were biting and the kids caught a cold, so we had to skip the whale watching trip, then about that investors ' meeting in New York. Amerimail is a bundle of contradictions, casual and yet direct, respectful yet over proud. In other words, Amerimail is America. Euromail is stiff and cold often beginning with a formal \"Dear Mr. X\" and ending with a simple \"Sincerely\". You won't find any mention of kids or the weather or jellyfish in Euromail. It's all business. It's also slow. Your correspondent might take days even weeks to answer a message. Euromail is exactly like the Europeans themselves. Recently about 100 managers were asked on both sides of the Atlantic whether they noticed differences in e-mail styles. Most said yes. Here are a few of their observations: \"Americans tend to write (e-mail) exactly as they speak.\" \"Why don't you just call me instead of writing five e-mails back and forth?\" \"Europeans are less interested in checking e-mail\". \"In general, Americans are much more responsive to e-mail--they respond faster and provide more information.\" So which is better, Euromail or Amerimail? I realized it's not popular these days to suggest we have anything to learn from Europeans, but I'm fed up with an inbox filled with casual, barely meaningful e-mails from friends and colleagues. If the alternative is a few earnestly written, carefully worded bits of Euromail, then I say, \"Bring it on.\" We can conclude from the passage that   _  .", "subject": ""}

Scientists have discovered that old bees have trouble finding their way to new hives as their learning behavior becomes increasingly inflexible.    Bees are typically impressive navigators, able to wind their way home through complex landscapes after visits to flowers far removed from their nests. But researchers from Arizona State University and the Norwegian University of Life Sciences found that aging damages the bees' ability to extinguish the memory of an unsuitable nest site even after the group has settled in a new home.    To test how old bees adapt to a changed home location, researchers trained bees to a new nest box while their former nest was closed off. Groups composed of mature and old bees were given several days in which to learn the new home location and to extinguish the bees' memory of their unusable former nest box. The scientists then tore down the bees' new home and forced groups of mixed-age bees to choose between three alternative nest locations, including the former nest box.    Old bees began flying toward the former nest site, despite the experience that should have told them that it was unusable. \"Although many old bees fail in learning tasks, we also discovered that a few still perform with excellence,\" explains Daniel Minch, lead author of the study and a senior life sciences researcher in Norway.

But which side deserves sympathy more, the jobless or the still employed? On March 6, researchers at a conference at the University of Cambridge heard data suggesting it's the latter.

The data suggest that employed people who feel insecure in their jobs show similar levels of anxiety and depression as those who are unemployed. Although a newly jobless person's mental health may \"bottom out\" after about six months, and then even begin to improve,the mental state of people who are continuously worried about losing their job \"just continues to get worse and worse,\" Burchell says.

It's better to get the bad news and start doing something about it rather than wait with anxiety.

{"answer": 2, "choices": ["Ancient Romans", "Hitler", "Napoleon", "Austrians"], "question": "It remains a curiosity and a bit of a historical mystery why we don't all drive on the same side of the road. The fact is that most people are right-handed; that's why, for much of history, drivers have stuck to the left. Ancient Romans using two-wheeled carriages are believed to have held the reins  with their right hands and a whip with their left; to avoid whipping the near drivers, they favored the left-hand side the road. It's also easier for right-handers to get on a horse from the left, so riders were attracted to that side to avoid the near traffic as they climbed on and off. Finally, knights  and the other drivers favored the left so they could do battle, if necessary, with their good hand. So why does most of the world travel on the right side today? Theories differ, but there's no doubt Napoleon was a major influence. The French have used the right since the late 18th century.  Some say that before the French Revolution, people in upper class drove their carriages on the left, forcing the _ to the right. During the violence, fearful rich people sought to mix with the peasantry by traveling on the right as well. Regardless of the origin, Napoleon brought right-hand traffic to the nations he conquered, including Russia, Switzerland and Germany. Hitler, in turn, ordered right-hand traffic in Czechoslovakia and Austria in the 1930s. Nations that escaped right-handed conquest, like Great Britain, kept their left-handed tradition.

As a result of the growth in fast-food restaurants (for example, McDonad's or KFC), more people are also eating out.

If you find the lowest price on the best hotel in Honolulu at the height of the season, you will save money, but still have a very expensive vacation. Trying to get exactly what you want will generally be an expensive proposition, in travel and in life. The other approach is to be a true opportunist.

Nonetheless  ,the travelers who get to travel the most, go to the widest variety of places, learn the most and do the most, are the opportunists. This will be true until you are so wealthy that you have no monetary (;)limits. The first time I went to Ecuador, I went there because it was cheap. If it wasn't, I would have had a great time--somewhere else. The trip lasted a month, and cost $1045, which included airfare and even the $130 fee for a guide to take me to the top or glacier   covered Mount Chimborazo. I cut the cost by taking a bus from my home in Michigan to Miami, and back again when I returned from Ecuador. The round-trip ticket cost $158. The round-trip flight to Quito from Miami was only $256, because it was a courier (,) flight, which meant I signed for some luggage(car parts), and  could only take carry-on luggage. Never did I feel deprived, or bored. I had a great time, eating wherever it was cheap and clean, doing all sorts of inexpensive, but interesting things, and traveling across the country to climb Chimborazo. I also met and fell in love with my wife Ana. Being an opportunist means you'll have just as much variety, and probably almost everything you want--eventually. You just have to stop trying to get exactly what you want exactly when you want it. If the guide that took me up Chimborazo hadn't dropped his price from $200 to $130, I would have spent $2 for a bus and gone hiking on EI Altar, another great Andean mountain.

Trying to get exactly what you want will generally be an expensive proposition, in travel and in life. The other approach is to be a true opportunist. This will be difficult for some of you, and entirely unacceptable to others. Nonetheless  ,the travelers who get to travel the most, go to the widest variety of places, learn the most and do the most, are the opportunists. This will be true until you are so wealthy that you have no monetary (;)limits. The first time I went to Ecuador, I went there because it was cheap. If it wasn't, I would have had a great time--somewhere else. The trip lasted a month, and cost $1045, which included airfare and even the $130 fee for a guide to take me to the top or glacier   covered Mount Chimborazo. I cut the cost by taking a bus from my home in Michigan to Miami, and back again when I returned from Ecuador. The round-trip ticket cost $158. The round-trip flight to Quito from Miami was only $256, because it was a courier (,) flight, which meant I signed for some luggage(car parts), and  could only take carry-on luggage. Never did I feel deprived, or bored. I had a great time, eating wherever it was cheap and clean, doing all sorts of inexpensive, but interesting things, and traveling across the country to climb Chimborazo. I also met and fell in love with my wife Ana. Being an opportunist means you'll have just as much variety, and probably almost everything you want--eventually. You just have to stop trying to get exactly what you want exactly when you want it. If the guide that took me up Chimborazo hadn't dropped his price from $200 to $130, I would have spent $2 for a bus and gone hiking on EI Altar, another great Andean mountain. That would have left me with enough money for several other minor adventures. It's suggested that the author   _  .", "subject": ""}

There are reasons for this great interest in the ideas, feelings, and actions of youth.     Today there are about seven million Americans in colleges and universities. Young persons under twenty-five  _ nearly half of the American population. Many of these will soon be in charge of the nation. Naturally their ideas are important to everyone in the country, and it is necessary for older people to understand what they think and feel.     College students today have strong opinions about right and wrong. They are deeply interested in making a better life for all people, especially for those who have not been given a fair chance before now. They see much that is wrong in the lives of their parents. It is hard for them to see what is right and good in the older ways. As a result, there is often trouble in American families. Your country may be meeting such problems, too.

The demands of my work and my three children had made it possible to visit her only occasionally. That night I called to invite her to go out for dinner and a movie. She thought about it for a moment, and then agreed. That Friday after work, I drove over to pick her up. When I arrived at her house, I noticed that she had curled her hair and was wearing the dress that she had worn to celebrate her last wedding anniversary. She smiled from a face that was as beautiful as an angel's. We went to a very nice and comfortable restaurant. After we sat down, I had to read the menu. A smile was on her lips.\"It was I who used to have to read the menu when you -were a child,\" she said. \"Then it's time that you relax and let me return the favor,\" I responded. During the dinner we had an agreeable conversation-nothing special but catching up on recent events of each other's life. We talked so much that we missed the movie. As we arrived at her house later, she said,\"I'll go out with you again, but only if you let me invite you.\" I agreed. A few days later my mother died of an unexpected heart attack. It happened so suddenly that I didn't have a chance to do anything for her. At that moment I understood the importance of saying \"I love you\" in time and giving our loved ones the time that they deserve. Nothing in life is more important than your family. Give them the time they deserve, because these things cannot be put off till \"some other time\". Why did the mother curl her hair and wear the dress that night?", "subject": ""}
