She thought about it for a moment, and then agreed. That Friday after work, I drove over to pick her up. When I arrived at her house, I noticed that she had curled her hair and was wearing the dress that she had worn to celebrate her last wedding anniversary. She smiled from a face that was as beautiful as an angel's. We went to a very nice and comfortable restaurant. After we sat down, I had to read the menu. A smile was on her lips.\"It was I who used to have to read the menu when you -were a child,\" she said. \"Then it's time that you relax and let me return the favor,\" I responded. During the dinner we had an agreeable conversation-nothing special but catching up on recent events of each other's life. We talked so much that we missed the movie. As we arrived at her house later, she said,\"I'll go out with you again, but only if you let me invite you.\" I agreed. A few days later my mother died of an unexpected heart attack.

American Secretary of State John Kerry spoke last Monday at a press conference in London.

Apart from this, studies are being carried out to harness  usable wind energy produced by man-made technologies. One useful source identified by Indian inventor Santosh Pradhan about two years ago is a speeding train, which produces fierce wind that can be transformed into electricity. According to Pradhan's proposal, with a few small improvements in existing trains running in Mumbai, the largest city in India, at least 10,000 megawatts  of electricity could be harvested each day. Building on this principle, designers Ale Leonetti Luparinia and Qian Jiang from Yanko Design have created a device  called T-Box that harnesses wind energy from speeding trains. T-Box can be placed within the railway tracks. It is half-buried underground between the concrete sleepers , which does not disturb the normal train operating at all. According to Yanko, around 150 T-Boxes can be fitted along a 1,000-meter railway track. A train running at a speed of 200 kph can produce winds blowing at 15 miles a second. Based on this calculation, 150 T-Boxes can produce 2.6 KWH of electricity per day. The T-Box's design won a silver medal in last year's Lite-On Awards and was exhibited last summer at the Xue Xue Institute in Taipei, Taiwan Province. Though the figures look impressive, it is important to remember that the design is still at a conceptual stage and hasn't taken into account issues such as pieces of waste material produced by the device and the efforts and costs involved in the maintenance  of the device. We can expect the technology to see the light of the day only after it clears these issues. If so, rail travel, one of the greenest forms of travel, will become greener and more energy-efficient.

The car makes the travel the most comfortable and cheapest. With a car people can go to any place without spending a lot of money. The second reason cars are popular is the fact that the United States never really developed a practical and cheap public travel system. Long distance trains have never been as common in the United States as they are in other parts of the world. Now there is a good system of air-service provided by planes. But it is too expensive to be used often. The third reason is the most important one, though. The American spirit of independence is what really made cars popular. Americans don't like waiting for a bus, or a train or even a plane. They don't like to have to follow an exact timetable. A car gives them the freedom to plan their own time.

Wounded veterans   learn they have two basic choices: They can receive almost $3,000 a month in disability benefits along with medical care and access to other various welfare programs, or they can try to find a job. Especially in this economy, it's no wonder that many find that first option hard to turn down. Mark Duggan, an economics professor at Stanford University, reports that enrollment in U.S.veterans' disability programs rose from 2.3 million in 2001 to 3.9 million in 2014. The percentage of veterans receiving benefits doubled, from 8.9% in 2001 to 18% in 2014. Disability services for veterans now consume $59 billion. In the 1980s and 1990s, male veterans were more likely to be in the labor force than nonveterans. But since 2000, that has changed dramatically. Now there is a 4% gap between veteran and nonveteran labor participation, with veteran participation lower. Navy SEAL Eric Greitens, founder of The Mission Continues, explains how soldiers who served their country are transformed into welfare receivers who live off their country. \"When veterans come home from war they are going through a tremendous change in identity,\"he says.\"Then the United States Department of Veterans Affairs, and others, encourage them to view themselves as disabled.\"By the time they come to Greitens' non-profit organization,\"We meet a number of veterans who see themselves as charity cases and are not sure anymore what they have to contribute.\" There are also more practical factors driving the disability boom. One is the expansion of qualification criteria. In 2000, for instance, type 2 diabetes was added as a disability because of evidence linking exposure to Agent Orange with the onset of the disease. Heart disease has also been added to the list. Another possible factor is that younger veterans seem less against welfare than their parents' generation. Veterans who have served since the 1990s are much more likely to sign up for disability than their older counterparts; 1 in 4 younger veterans is on disability versus just 1 in 7 of those over age 54. We shouldn't go back to the bad old days when veterans were afraid to admit weakness. But Lt.Col.Daniel Gade is one of many veterans who think our disability system is harmful, psychologically, to former soldiers. Gade lost his leg in combat in 2005 and now teaches at West Point. He recently gave a talk to disabled veterans at Ft. Carson, in which he urged them to rejoin the workforce. \"People who stay home because they are getting paid enough to get by on disability are worse off,\"he warned.\"They are more likely to abuse drugs and alcohol. They are more likely to live alone.\" What a waste of human potential, especially since most veterans on disability still have their prime working years ahead of them when they're discharged . We could solve this problem by changing the way we view -- and label -- veterans with disabilities. As Gade noted in a recent article,\"Veterans should be viewed as resources, not as damaged goods.\"He recommended that\"efforts to help veterans should begin by recognizing their abilities rather than focusing only on their disabilities, and should serve the ultimate aim of moving wounded soldiers to real self-sufficiency.\" On a more practical note, the United States Department of Veterans Affairs could reallocate resources to spend more on job training and less on disability. Current placement programs are sadly inadequate. We are good at sending soldiers off to war. Yet when these young men and women return home, they are essentially told,\"We'll give you enough for a reasonably comfortable life, but we won't help you find a job.\" It is unreasonable that we are condemning thousands of young veterans who served their country to life on the dole   rather than enabling them to reenter the workforce with the necessary accommodations.

Wounded veterans   learn they have two basic choices: They can receive almost $3,000 a month in disability benefits along with medical care and access to other various welfare programs, or they can try to find a job. Especially in this economy, it's no wonder that many find that first option hard to turn down. Mark Duggan, an economics professor at Stanford University, reports that enrollment in U.S.veterans' disability programs rose from 2.3 million in 2001 to 3.9 million in 2014. The percentage of veterans receiving benefits doubled, from 8.9% in 2001 to 18% in 2014. Disability services for veterans now consume $59 billion. In the 1980s and 1990s, male veterans were more likely to be in the labor force than nonveterans. But since 2000, that has changed dramatically. Now there is a 4% gap between veteran and nonveteran labor participation, with veteran participation lower. Navy SEAL Eric Greitens, founder of The Mission Continues, explains how soldiers who served their country are transformed into welfare receivers who live off their country. \"When veterans come home from war they are going through a tremendous change in identity,\"he says.\"Then the United States Department of Veterans Affairs, and others, encourage them to view themselves as disabled.\"By the time they come to Greitens' non-profit organization,\"We meet a number of veterans who see themselves as charity cases and are not sure anymore what they have to contribute.\" There are also more practical factors driving the disability boom. One is the expansion of qualification criteria. In 2000, for instance, type 2 diabetes was added as a disability because of evidence linking exposure to Agent Orange with the onset of the disease. Heart disease has also been added to the list. Another possible factor is that younger veterans seem less against welfare than their parents' generation. Veterans who have served since the 1990s are much more likely to sign up for disability than their older counterparts; 1 in 4 younger veterans is on disability versus just 1 in 7 of those over age 54.

I got a taste of that dream in 2001,when my husband arranged for me to ride in a hot air balloon for my birthday. But the experience turned out to be very dull. Around that time, I told my husband that I wanted to skydive. So when our retirement community announced that they were having an essay competition and the topic was an experience of a lifetime that you wanted to have, I decided to write about my dream. In the essay, I wrote about my desire to skydive, stating George Brush Sr. did it at age 80. Why not me? I was just 84 and in pretty good health. A year went by and I heard nothing. But then at a community party in late April 2009, they announced that I was one of the winners. I just couldn't believe it. Inspired by this, I decided to realize my dream, even though some of my family members and my doctor were against it. On June 11, 2009, nearly 40 of my family and friends gathered in the area close to where I would land while I headed up in the airplane. My _ , Jay, guided me through the experience. The plane was the noisiest one I had ever been in, but I wasn't frightened--I was really just looking forward to the experience. When we reached 13,000 feet, Jay instructed me to throw myself out of the plane. When we first hit the air, the wind was so strong that I could hardly breathe. For a second I thought, \"What have I gotten myself into?\" But then everything got calmer. We were in a free fall for about a minute before Jay opened the parachute , then we just floated downward for about five minutes. Being up in the clouds and looking at the view below was unlike anything I have ever felt--much better than the hot air balloon. I was just enjoying it. Skydiving was really one of the greatest experiences of my life. I hope other people will look at me and realize that you don't stop living just because you are 84 years old.

I got a taste of that dream in 2001,when my husband arranged for me to ride in a hot air balloon for my birthday. But the experience turned out to be very dull. Around that time, I told my husband that I wanted to skydive. So when our retirement community announced that they were having an essay competition and the topic was an experience of a lifetime that you wanted to have, I decided to write about my dream. In the essay, I wrote about my desire to skydive, stating George Brush Sr. did it at age 80. Why not me? I was just 84 and in pretty good health. A year went by and I heard nothing.

But his work changed the way we learn, the way we live, and even the way we think. Philo Farnsworth is responsible for one of the 20thcentury: television. Philo Farnsworth was born in America in 1906. He was interested in science and technology at an early age. When he was twelve years old, he built an electric motor for his family's washing machine.

The traveler on foot, on the other hand , lives constantly in the present, For him traveling and arriving are one and the same thing: he arrives somewhere with every step he makes, He experiences, the present moment with his eyes, his ears and the whole of his body, At the end of his journey he feels a delicious physical tiredness, Satisfying sleep will be his: the just reward of all true travelers.

When you wake up? Before bed? A dozen times in between? The technology that was supposed to simplify our lives has become the vital time-suck: the average teen spends more than seven hours a day using technological devices, plus an additional hour just text-messaging friends. The advantage of technological devices is connectedness: email lets us respond on the go, and we are in touch with more people during more hours of the day than at any other time in history. But is it possible we're more lonely than ever, too? That's what MIT professor Sherry Turkle observes in her new book, Alone Together, a fascinating portrait of our changing relationship with technology. Turkle details the ways technology has redefined our comprehension of closeness and loneliness--and warns us of the danger of accepting such virtual  relationships in place of lasting emotional connections.

But is it possible we're more lonely than ever, too? That's what MIT professor Sherry Turkle observes in her new book, Alone Together, a fascinating portrait of our changing relationship with technology. Turkle details the ways technology has redefined our comprehension of closeness and loneliness--and warns us of the danger of accepting such virtual  relationships in place of lasting emotional connections. For Turkle, the biggest worry is the effect all these shallow connections have on our development. Is technology offering us the lives we want to live? \"We're texting people at a distance,\" says Turkle, \"We're using lifeless objects to convince ourselves that even when we're alone, we feel together. And then when we're with each other, we put ourselves in situations where we are alone--constantly on our mobile devices. It's what I call a perfect storm of confusion about what's important in our human connections.\" What can't be denied is that technology, whatever its faults, makes life a whole lot easier. It allows us to communicate with more people in less time and makes conversation simple. But it can also be seductive , providing more stimulation than our natural lives. There are usually some unhealthy videos online which remove teenagers' attention from their schoolwork. Besides, some online activities make people addicted, which occupied their daily life and affected their ability to form real-world relationships.\"Technology can be more immediately satisfying than the labor of building an intimate relationship,\" said one highschool student, \"Every time I text, I start to have some happy feelings.\" But are any of those feelings equal to the kind we feel when engaged in real, face-to-face communication? Online, you can neglect others' feelings. In a text message, you can avoid eye contact. A number of studies have found that this generation of teens is less sympathetic than ever.

The cubs' mother had been killed by a lion. The cheetahs were only a few weeks old. In the wild, about 9 out of 10 cheetah cubs die before they are three months old. They are food for lions. But these cubs were so lucky that they were saved by their \"heroes\", who brought them to Jane and Ian Craig. The Craigs help save endangered animals at the Lewa Wildlife Conservancy. The Craigs nursed the cheetah cubs back to health -- feeding them with bottles, sleeping with them, and comforting them. They named the cubs Sambu and Toki. But what would become of these cubs? How would they survive on their own? In the wild, cubs stay with their mothers until they are almost 2 years old. During that time, cheetah mothers teach their young how to hunt and how to protect themselves. The Craigs wouldn't be able to find a cheetah mother to teach the cubs. So they turned to a man named Simon King. King has spent more than twenty years studying cheetahs. He gave them a nod of approval when hearing about this, though taking care of two baby cubs would take a huge amount of time. For two years, he would need to have them at his side most of the time. But he felt there was no other choice. And so, when the brothers were one month old, King became their father. The brothers followed King everywhere. If they saw large dangerous and fierce mammals, King would growl at the cubs the way a mother cheetah would have, which was a signal for the cubs to stay away. They learned quickly. King taught the cheetahs to hunt using a toy rabbit as King pulled it around on a rope. With more lessons and training, the brothers began to hunt on their own. King is one proud father now.

But modern pirates are not a thing of the past. Last month Somali pirates did their boldest hijacking   to date.

The pirates have kept hitting the headlines this year: 92 attacks have been attempted, with 36 successful hijackings and 268 crew members taken hostage  . The Chinese fishing ship Tianyu 8, with 17 Chinese and 8 foreigners on board, has been in their hands since November 14. Of course piracy   is nothing new. Even since there has been water and ships there have been pirates. The earliest documented history of pirates dates back to the 13thcentury in the Mediterranean Sea. Even the famous Roman emperor Julius Caesar was once kidnapped by pirates. Piracy reached its peak in the mid-1700s. It was during this time in the Caribbean and off the coast of Africa that men like \"Blackbeard the Pirate\" made this profession attractive. But with the creation of stronger national Navies piracy became less popular around the world. In the mid-20thcentury, most pirates were petty   thieves. They used hooks to sneak   on board ships at anchor, and grabbed all that they could find. _  However, nowadays piracy has become a multi-million-dollar business at tracting many in poor countries. Pirates are treated like heroes among local fishermen. They use satellite phones and Global Positioning Systems (GPS). Once they spot their target, they swarm the ship with fast boats and shoot it by firing AK-47s or even rocket-propelled grenades  . Then they hold the ship and its crews for money. \"The world should take forceful actions together to fight piracy,\" said leaders at the Asian and Pacific Economic Cooperation (APEC) summit in Peru. \"However, putting in anti-piracy army can only be half of the solution. We have to protect the fair chance of Somali fishermen to get a good living and keep them from the lure of easy money,\" said Peter Lehr, a lecturer in terrorism studies.

Even the famous Roman emperor Julius Caesar was once kidnapped by pirates. Piracy reached its peak in the mid-1700s. It was during this time in the Caribbean and off the coast of Africa that men like \"Blackbeard the Pirate\" made this profession attractive. But with the creation of stronger national Navies piracy became less popular around the world. In the mid-20thcentury, most pirates were petty   thieves. They used hooks to sneak   on board ships at anchor, and grabbed all that they could find. _  However, nowadays piracy has become a multi-million-dollar business at tracting many in poor countries. Pirates are treated like heroes among local fishermen. They use satellite phones and Global Positioning Systems (GPS). Once they spot their target, they swarm the ship with fast boats and shoot it by firing AK-47s or even rocket-propelled grenades  . Then they hold the ship and its crews for money. \"The world should take forceful actions together to fight piracy,\" said leaders at the Asian and Pacific Economic Cooperation (APEC) summit in Peru. \"However, putting in anti-piracy army can only be half of the solution. We have to protect the fair chance of Somali fishermen to get a good living and keep them from the lure of easy money,\" said Peter Lehr, a lecturer in terrorism studies.

Where it is simple to measure the work done, as in the work done with the hands, monetary encouragement schemes are often chosen, for indirect workers, where measurement is difficult, methods of additional payments are employed.

According to a new study, more American adults than ever are reporting being disabled by the symptoms of depression, anxiety or other emotional problems. The report, published Thursday in the American Journal of Public Health, found that people who said they couldn't perform everyday tasks or engage in social and leisure activities because of a mental illness increased from 2 percent in 1999 to 2.7 percent in 2009. That increase amounts to nearly 2 million more people disabled by mental distress   in the past decade, the report said. Although people did not say they felt more mental distressed compared to past years, they reported that their mental health problems had a greater impact on their daily lives. Dr. Ramin Mojtabai, the study's author, said it's unclear whether the findings tell a sad story of greater mental distress in recent times or point to a victory for public education about the importance of acknowledging and evaluating mental illness. \"It is possible that people are realizing the effects of mental illness more acutely now than before,\" he said. \"People could be becoming more aware. \" Mojtabai said it's also possible that a number of factors could be taking a toll on the population's mental well-being. High unemployment, economic hardships and a growing sense of isolation could be putting greater stress on Americans. But Duckworth said there could be a more positive explanation -- like his fellow swimmers, people may be getting more comfortable with talking about their mental distress. \"I wonder if this tells us that American culture is becoming more open and is giving people the ability to speak about it,\" he said. \"If people have this problem and are willing to acknowledge it, then we're getting closer to dealing with it.\" Why was Dr. Ken Duckworth surprised when other swimmers talked about the depression with him?", "subject": ""}

We are located 3 degrees south of the equator in the Region of Loreto, which is roughly the size of Montana and is one of the richest areas in the world in terms of flora  and fauna . Our team consists of lawyers, ecologists, sociologists, medical professionals and native Amazonians working together to protect the forest and its people from destruction. We use litigation , filing lawsuits against those who seek to destroy the forest and its native cultures. In addition to legal processes, we promote health, education, and the conservation of native plants and animals. The Amazon Rainforest is commonly referred to as the \"lungs of the planet\" whose trees are essential for absorbing carbon dioxide (CO2, a greenhouse gas that causes global warming) and it into oxygen, thereby mitigating the rise of global temperatures and climate change.  An estimated 120 billion tons of carbon dioxide is absorbed in the Amazon Rainforest and global emissions of carbon dioxide increase with every tree of the rainforest that is cut down. That is why the survival of the Amazon Rainforest is vital for the survival of our planet, without which rising global temperatures could melt the polar icecaps and cause flooding of our coastal cities. Currently, the Amazon is under siege , with an estimated 1000 hectares being destroyed everyday.  After harvesting old growth forests, corporations are often replacing the native forest with palm oil plantations instead of reforesting with native tree species.  Palm oil trees are native to Africa, not the Amazon, and due to high profits, their promotion by international aid agencies and recent legislation in Peru, palm oil plantations represent perhaps the single greatest threat to the native Amazon Rainforest. In addition to conventional logging and deforesting to make room for crops such as palm oil and soybeans, the Amazon forest faces a new threat in the form of REDD projects and \"Carbon Cowboys\".  REDD refers to Reducing Emissions from Deforestation and Forest Degradation by using carbon offsets (\"carbon credits\").  Under the guise of REDD projects, scammers are tricking native communities into signing unjust contracts in English without legal representation which essentially give these so called Carbon Cowboys the forest for free. These cheaters are making false promises of \"billions of dollars in profits\" from REDD and voluntary carbon offset  projects by lying that they are representatives of the United Nations and World Bank in order to trick vulnerable indigenous Amazonians into ceding their land by signing unjust contracts with hidden clauses that give the Carbon Cowboys a power of attorney to do whatever they want with the forest for a period of 100 years.

Another user Lucky said, \"Why does my belly button suddenly look and feel completely new?\" While the trend was popular with many female users on Weibo, a photo uploaded by a male blogger caught people's eye. \"Is this pose   really that difficult? I don't think so,\" Said Weibo user Sough Sa. His photo showing he was trying to touch his belly button was shared more than 8,452 times. It also drew over 2,000 comments from other users on Weibo. \"Show the skinny girls how it's done,\" said one user. Weibo user MedicalCream Tang Zhao said, \"Now you did it! So you don't have to lose weight and please stay the same.\" \"I always support failures. Now I don't feel so bad about not being able to touch my belly button,\" said another user Jacket. \"Do we need to have flexible arms or a skinny waist to pull this off?\" asked Weibo user Chantilly623. But some experts argued that China's new belly button trend was actually distorting   society's standards of beauty. \"These poses and pictures can be fun but sometimes they also become an expression of competitiveness,\" said Jolene Tan, Programmes and Communications Senior Manager in Singapore championing women's rights. She also told the BBC that the trend seemed to be a way of examining women's bodies to see whether they are good enough. However, experienced body trainers say the new trend is about flexibility of the arm and the size of the waist, rather than a good figure. A skinny person with fewer muscles has a better chance of achieving the pose. What is experienced body trainers' attitude towards the new trend meaning a good figure?", "subject": ""}

These animals typically live between the surface of the ocean and a depth of about 3,300 feet--as far as most light can reach. Most of them are extremely delicate and can be damaged by a simple touch. Sonke Johnsen, a scientist in biology, says, \"These animals live through their life alone. They never touch anything unless they're eating it, or unless something is eating them.\" And they are as clear as glass. How does an animal become see-through? It's trickier than you might think. The objects around you are visible because they interact with light. Light typically travels in a straight line. But some materials slow and scatter  light, bouncing it away from its original path. Others absorb light, stopping it _ in its tracks. Both scattering and absorption make an object look different from other objects around it, so you can see it easily. But a transparent object doesn't absorb or scatter light, at least not very much, Light can pass through it without bending or stopping. That means a transparent object doesn't look very different from the surrounding air or water. You don't see it ----you see the things behind it. To become transparent, an animal needs to keep its body from absorbing or scattering light. Living materials can stop light because they contain pigments  that absorb specific colors of light. But a transparent animal doesn't have pigments, so its tissues won't absorb light. According to Johnsen, avoiding absorption is actually easy. The real challenge is preventing light from scattering. Animals are built of many different materials----skin, fat, and more----and light moves through each at a different speed. Every time light moves into a material with a new speed, it bends and scatters. Transparent animals use different tricks to fight scattering. Some animals are simply very small or extremely flat. Without much tissue to scatter light, it is easier to be see--through. Others build a large, clear mass of non-living jelly-lie material and spread themselves over it . Larger transparent animals have the biggest challenge, because they have to make all the different tissues in their bodies slow down light exactly as much as water does. They need to look uniform. But how they're doing it is still unknown. One thing is clear for these larger animals, staying transparent is an active process. When they die, they turn a non-transparent milky white. One way for an animal to become transparent is to   _  .", "subject": ""}

In those days, it was nicknamed \"the Garden City\", almost certainly the source of Howard's name for his later building plan of towns. Returning to London, Howard developed his design in the 1880s and 1890s, _ ideas that were popular at the time, but creating a unique combination  of designs. The nineteenth-century poor city was in many ways a terrible place, dirty and crowded; but it offered economic and social opportunities. At the same time, the British countryside was in fact equally unattractive: though it promised fresh air and nature, it suffered from agricultural depression  and it offered neither enough work and wages, nor much social life. Howard's idea was to combine the best of town and country in a new kind of settlement, the garden city. Howard's idea was that a group of people should set up a company, borrowing money to establish a garden city in the depressed countryside; far enough from existing cities to make sure that the land was bought at the bottom price. Garden cities would provide a central public open space, radial avenues and connecting industries. They would be surrounded by a much larger area of green belt, also owned by the company, containing not merely farms but also some industrial institutions. As more and more people moved in, the garden city would reach its planned limit-----Howard suggested 32,000 people; then, another would be started a short distance away. Thus, over time, there would develop a vast planned house collection, extending almost without limit; within it, each garden city would offer a wide rang of jobs and services, but each would also be connected to the others by a rapid transportation system, thus giving all the economic and social opportunities of a big city.

So far, this has only remained a dream. Many people have wondered whether it would be possible to find a way to preserve human bodies, and what would be the best way. It has long been known that meat of fruit can be kept fresh for long periods by freezing; in ancient China, for example, food was stored with ice to keep it fresh. This method could also be useful for preserving humans. However, most living beings that exist under warm conditions die when frozen. This is because of the harmful effects of freezing ice crystals , which not only are larger than the volume  of the water originally in the cells, but also form sharp cutting shapes that harm the cells. In the 1940s Dr B.J. Luyet and a group of scientists in England were working on the problem of freezing cells without damaging them. Since the harm caused by ice crystals was the main cause of damage, Luyet suggested removing some or all of the water from the cells before freezing them. Using living cells form chicken, Luyet and his assistants discovered that they could partly dry the chicken cells, using a mixture of the white part of an egg and glycerin  . Some success was obtained. The chicken cells were dried, frozen for a period of time, and then carefully unfrozen. Almost all the cells recovered when they reached normal temperatures. Since then, the cooling of whole animals to a temperature far below freezing point for later unfreezing has become more of a possibility, and the glycerin method would probably be used to accomplish this.

The project, first launched in 2011, aimed to answer one significant question: Is life in the tropics improving? To find out, the researchers analyzed environmental, social, and economic indicators collected over 6 decades. It finds that the region has made \"extraordinary progress\" in many areas.

{"answer": 2, "choices": ["People may share their sorrow and pain with their convenience friends.", "People may borrow a large sum of money from their convenience friends.", "People may ask their convenience friends to pick up their children for them.", "People would like to seek comfort and convenience from their convenience friends."], "question": "Women were friends, I once would have said, when they totally love and support and trust each other, and bear to each other the secrets of their souls, and run--no questions asked--to help each other, and tell _ truths to each other(No, you can't wear that dress unless you lose ten pounds first.) when these truths must be told. In other words, I once would have said that a friend is a friend all the way, but now I believe that's narrow point of view. Friendships serve many different functions,meet different needs and range from those as all-the-way as the friendship of the soul sisters mentioned above to that of the most casual playmates. Convenience friends are women with whom we'd have no particular reason to be friends: a next-door neighbor or the mother of one of our children's closest friends. They'll lend us their cups for a party. They'll drive our kids to school when we're sick. They'll take us to pick up our car when we need a lift .As we will for them. But we don't , with convenience friends, ever come too close or tell too much; we maintain our public face and emotional distance. Special-interest friends aren't intimate ,and they needn't involve kids or cats. Their value lies in some interest jointly shared .And so we may have an office friend or a tennis friend. \"I've got one woman friend,\" says Joyce,\" who likes, as I do, to take music courses, which makes it nice for me and her. I'd say that what we're doing is doing together, not being together.\" Crossroads friends are important for what was for the friendship we shared at a crucial ,now past, time of life. A time, perhaps, when we roomed in college together or went together through pregnancy, birth and that scary first year of new motherhood. Crossroads friends develop powerful links, links strong enough to endure with not much more contact than once-a-year letters at Christmas. And out of respect for those crossroads years, for those dramas and dreams we once shared, we will always be friends. Crossroads friends seem to maintain a special kind of intimacy ----dormant  but always ready to be revived  ---and though we may rarely meet ,whenever we do connect, it's personal and strong. Another kind of intimacy exists in the cross-generational friendships, the friends that form across generation in what one  woman calls her daughter-mother and her mother-daughter relationships. There are good friends, pretty good friends and very good friends, and these friendships are defined by their level of intimacy. We might tell a good friend, for example, that yesterday we had a fight with our husband.

New contracts for exploration will be signed in non-protected areas of Alaska and in the Gulf of Mexico. In his weekly speech , the President insisted the US could reduce its need for imported oil and improve safety.

The President's proposals  come after Republicans   introduced a series of proposals that would expand and speed up oil and gas production. The White House has criticized the Republican proposals for safety reasons , but Mr Obama was clear in his speech that he felt safety and environmental standards could be maintained even though production might rise. \" I believe that we should continue to expand oil production in America --even as we increase safety and environmental standards ,\"he said. \"As a nation, we should be investing in the clean, renewable sources of energy that are the solution to high gas prices.\" Mr Obama has previously called for a step-change in energy policy, saying the US must move towards getting 80%of its electricity from clean energy sources by 2035.

In his black and blue suit and with an oxygen tank fastened on his back, Larry dived from boats into the middle of the ocean. Dangerous areas did not prevent him from continuing his search. Sometimes, he was limited to a cage underwater but that did not bother him. At least, he was still able to take photographs of the underwater creatures. Larry's first expedition without his father was in the Cayman Islands. There were numerous diving spots in the area and Larry was determined to visit all of them. Fortunately for him, a man offered to take him around the different Spots for free. _ The diving spots afforded such a wide array of fish and sea creatures that Larry saw more than thirty varieties of creatures. Larry looked at his daughter. She looked as excited as he had been when he was her age. He hoped she would be able to continue the family tradition. Already, she looked like she was much braver than had been then. This was the key to a successful underwater expedition. What did Larry expect his daughter to do?", "subject": ""}

During the Fashion Week of NYC in 2005, Rodman came not to sit in the front row at a show, but to unveil his provocative (, ) new PETA advertisement.In the very tents where designers were pushing fur.In PETA's advertisement, Rodman appears nude   --- except for his tattoos --- alongside the caption ( ), \" Think Ink, Not Mink,\" and urges :\" Be comfortable in your own skin and let animals keep theirs.\"     Rodman watched Pamela Anderson's three-minute video showing how animals live and die before being made into fur coats.\"If you actually look at the video firsthand, it gives you a different perspective on animals and how they're treateD.It's  _ to see what they go through,\" he saiD.

To defend my home from break-in, I picked up my defense weapon--- a broom and went out. There on the roof of my porch , I saw a grey fluffy squirrel. I drove her away with the broom, but the next day I heard her again. I searched squirrels on the net and found because their teeth keep growing, they have to constantly chew on things to shorten their teeth. This was disturbing so I asked my husband to call in some wildlife control people. On Monday morning two men showed up, with guns in their hands. I pointed uneasily to the hole in my porch roof. They held up their guns. Suddenly I saw in my mind the baby nursery inside. I stopped them and confirmed that they wouldn't harm her. They hesitated, but finally put down their guns. Then they brought out a bottle of deodorizer and sprayed it into the squirrel's home. They told me she would not like the smell and would leave. There was no sign of Mrs. Squirrel, so they blocked the hole, took my cheque for $250 and left. Shortly after they left, Mrs. Squirrel returned from her shopping trip. She was mad at being driven out and began feverishly clawing at the porch roof. In order to stop the destruction of my home, I drove her away with the broom again. Each day thereafter, Mrs. Squirrel continued her attack on my possession. I then called the company to report that \"SHE'S BAAAAAACK...\" The receptionist said that if Mrs. Squirrel had managed to find another way into my porch roof, it would be a new charge.

That's what Australian researchers found when they collected TV viewing information from more than 11,000 people older than 25 years. The study found that people who watches an average six hours of TV a day lived an average 4.8 years less than those who didn't watch any television .Also ,every hour of TV that participants watched after age 25 was associated with a 22-minute reduction in their life expectancy . It's no mystery that sitting in front of the TV isn't exactly healthy. The more TV you watch, the less physically active you are. And the less exercise you get, the more likely you are to develop disease such as diabetes or hear problems.

His owner Qiu Hong, a sports marketer,lets the dog enjoy two daily walks,a collection of imported American toys, $300 worth of monthly food and treats and his own sofa in her high-rise apartment. When Ms. Qiu feels bored, she takes Xiangzi out for a long run in her car. In a sense, Xiangzi is not just a dog, but a social phenomenon - and, perhaps, a marker of how quickly the Chinese nation is booming through its transformation from poor farmer to first-world citizen.Twenty years ago,there were hardly any dogs in Beijing, but now there're 900,000 registered dogs with countless thousands of others unlicensed. How this came to be is, in some ways, the story of modern China as well.  \"People used to be focused on improving their own lives, and they weren't really acquainted with raising dogs,\" said Ms. Qiu. \"But with the improvement in the economy, people's outlooks   have changed.\"  Having a dog can be a way to relieve the stress in people's lives, but mostly Beijing dogs have, as in the West, become objects of affection - even devotion - by their owners. It's easy to find dog-treat stores, dog Web sites, dog social networks, dog swimming pools - even, for a time recently, a bring-your-dog cinema and a bring-your-dog bar on Beijing's downtown nightclub row. The doglike devotion of pet owners here seems to have softened the city government heart. In 1994, Beijing officials relaxed their no-dog policy to \"severely restrict\" dogs. In 2003,it was changed again to allow anyone to own a dog, but to limit city dogs to no more than 35 centimeters in height. And nowadays the restriction seems to be loosely carried out.  As for sti-fried Pekingese  - well, that dog,too, may have seen its day. A formal suggestion to ban the eating of dogs has been made by a law professor named Chang Jiwen, who considered himself \"not so much a dog lover as a China lover\". \"With China developing so quickly, more people should know how to treat animals properly,\" he said in 3 telephone interview.

About 45 percent of children suffer passive smoking in families, 50 percent in public places, and almost 6 percent on public transportation, shows a research released by the Shanghai Children's Medical Center on Tuesday. \"Not only adults but also children and newborn babies are at risk for the adverse effects of passive smoking,\" said Tang Jingyan, a doctor at the Shanghai Children's Medical Center. \"Actually, those young children whose bodies are still growing and developing are more sensitive to the effects of secondhand smoke.\" Research has shown that children who are exposed to secondhand smoke will suffer from more colds, coughs and sore throats, and they are more likely to suffer from bronchitis, pneumonia and will have a higher risk of developing cancer. Doctors even suggested that children suffering passive smoking are more likely to have behavioral problems and may not develop mentally as quickly as their peers. Other research by the Shanghai Children's Medical Center has found that more than 80 percent of child patients in the center live in a smoke-filled household, where one or both parents smoke. \"Though doctors have stressed the harm of passive smoking over and over, it is still hard to reach a totally 'smoke free' home,\" said a pediatrician named Zhang Yiwen, noting that parents are often tempted to smoke even though they have learned the harmful effects of secondhand smoke. China has 540 million people suffering from passive smoke, 180 million of them younger than 15.The age of smokers is also getting lower, earlier reports said. \"There are more young smokers than before.You can see young people wearing a school uniform and carrying a schoolbag light a cigarette on the street.Some of them are even female students,\" said Jing Xingming, a professor of children's developmental behavior at the center. \"Children like to imitate adults, especially their parents.If parents often smoke at home, it is very likely children will develop a smoking habit, which can cause a vicious circle,\" Jin said.

He was wearing heavy clothes and fur boots. But he still felt cold and uncomfortable. The man was on his way to a camp near Henderson Creek. His friends were already there. He expected to reach Henderson Creek by six o'clock that evening. It would be dark by then. His friends would have a fire and hot food ready for him. A dog walked behind the man. It was a big gray animal, half dog and half wolf. The dog did not like the extreme cold. It knew the weather was too cold to travel. The man continued to walk down the trail. He came to a frozen stream called Indian Creek. He began to walk on the snow-covered ice. It was a trail that would lead him straight to Henderson Creek and his friends. As he walked, he looked charily at the ice in front of him. Once, he stopped suddenly, and then walked around a part of the frozen stream. He saw that an underground spring flowed under the ice at that spot. It made the ice thin. If he stepped there, he might break through the ice into a pool of water. To get his boots wet in such cold weather might kill him. His feet would turn to ice quickly. He could freeze to death. At about twelve o'clock, the man decided to stop to eat his lunch. He took off the glove on his right hand, opened his jacket and shirt, and pulled out his bread and meat. This took less than twenty seconds. Yet, his fingers began to freeze. He hit his hand against his leg several times until he felt a sharp pain. Then he quickly put his glove on his hand. He made a fire, beginning with small pieces of wood and adding larger ones.

Around the holidays, many families don' t consider taking proper measures to prevent t heir homes from suffering holiday thefts. With just a few simple steps, you can better make sure of the safety of your home during all of the holiday celebrations. Here are a few tips for making it difficult to tell you are away from home.   * Either have a trusted neighbor pick up your mail and newspapers, or tell your mailperson to hold your mail until you return. Nothing says\"Hey, we are not home! \"like when your postbox is filled with all kinds of mails and you have many different newspapers in your driveway.   * Set several different lights in your house on random timers  .Don' t leave your outdoor lights on all the time. Instead, put your outside lights on timers to be on during the nights.

Before her the place belonged to Xue Xiaolu, the director of Finding Mr. Right, which hit Chinese screens early this year. With the box office success of So Young, people are once again turning their nostalgic eyes to youth -- an era of passion and pain, of hope and heartbreak. The reason why youth is such a soft spot for many people is that its intangible nature cannot be truly grasped until it is lost. \"It is the period between education and employment, between dependence and independence,\"says Zhang Yiwu, professor of Chinese literature at Peking University. But Jiang Chuling, the writer of So Young, says youth shares many similarities with home. When you leave home, you start missing it. \"I think youth is meaningless for young people. Only when you look back does it acquire a special meaning,\" she says. For Zhang Yueran, 31, who is regarded as one of the country's most promising young novelist, \"heroism in youth\" was a cultural asset of people born in the 1970s, but it was swept away by the materialism that is so common in today's world. Nostalgia for the post-1980s and post-1990s generation, according to Zhang Yiwu, comes from their frustration and anxiety. Born into the most affluent society in 100 years, this generation of single children is not as tough as their predecessors. \"They have very high expectations toward life and their disappointment and frustration with reality is huge,\" says Zhang. \"So they turn to the past for comfort, even though they are still young. \" So Young tells a love story set in the 80s and 90s.

On the contrary, both their knowledge and experience are enriched. We feel that there are many disadvantages in streaming pupils. It does not take into account the fact that children develop at different rates. It can have a bad effect on both the bright and the not-so-bright child. After all, it can be quite discouraging to be at the bottom of the top grade! Besides, it is rather unusual to grade pupils just according to their intellectual ability. This is only one aspect of their total personality. We are concerned to develop the abilities of all our pupils to the full, not just their learning ability. We also value personal qualities and social skills, and we find that mixed ability teaching contributes to all these aspects of learning. In our classrooms, we work in various ways. The pupils often work in groups: this gives them the opportunity to learn to co-operate, to share, and to develop leadership skills. They also learn how to deal with personal problems as well as learning how to think, to make decisions, to analyze and assess, and to communicate effectively. The pupils learn from each other as well as from the teacher.  Sometimes the pupils work in pairs; sometimes they work on individual tasks and assignments, and they can do this at their own speed. They also have some formal class teaching when this is proper. We encourage our pupils to use the library, and we teach them the skills they need in order to do this efficiently. And advanced pupil can do advanced work. It doesn't matter what age the child is. We expect our pupils to do their best, not their least, and we give them every encouragement to achieve this goal.

Besides white coins, the chimps were given yellow coins to insert into the slot, but nothing came out because they were worthless. The chimps soon learned this fact. When a handful of white and yellow coins were thrown into the cage housing, Bula, Bimba and Alpha, the three chimps rushed for the white coins and never touched the yellow ones. Now the chimps were madly in love with money. Would the six chimps value money enough to work for it? To find the answer, Dr Wolfe designed a work machine. The chimps were shown that when a large handle was lifted, they could pick one grape. When they had learned the skill of lifting the handle to get the grape, Dr Wolf made a change to the machines so that instead of the grape they would find a white coin.

The young scientists and their teachers were very sad to find that their insect astronauts had all died at some point before the container was returned to the school and opened. The problem didn't occur in space, but on the ground after challenger had landed. The container remained in the desert for nearly a week before the ant colony was moved. The hot, dry desert air dried out the colony's container and the ants died from lack of moisture .               The project was tested success because it did provide useful information. Students will continue their efforts to pinpoint  what went wrong. They will try to prevent the same difficulties from recurring on future missions. They don't want to be discouraged either by the demise of the ants or by the $10,000 shuttle fare they will have to pay to send the next colony of ants into space.

Over the past 400 years the form of the language used in the Americas--especially in the United States--and that used in the United Kingdom have diverged in a few minor ways, leading to the versions now occasionally referred to as American English and British English.

One particular contribution towards formalizing these differences came from Noah Webster, who wrote the first American dictionary (published 1828) with the intention of showing that people in the United States spoke a different dialect from Britain, much like a regional accent. It may be the case that increased worldwide communication through radio, television, the Internet and globalization has reduced the tendency towards regional variation.

At the same time that people in Biloxi were thankful for the advance warning, some residents of New Orleans, Louisiana were less satisfied.A day before Georges made landfall, forecasters were predicting that the hurricane had a good chance of striking New Orleans.Because much of New Orleans lies below sea level, the city is at risk for flooding.Emergency management officials must begin evacuations well before a storm strikes.But evacuation costs money: businesses close, tourists leave, and citizens take precautionary measures.The mayor of New Orleans estimated that his city' s preparations for Georges cost more than 50 million.After Georges missed New Orleans, some residents questioned the value of the hurricane forecasts in the face of such high costs. The different views on the early warnings for Hurricane Georges show some of the complexities related to predicting disasters.Disaster prediction is a process of providing scientific information to the government officials and other decision makers who must respond to those predictions.

{"answer": 1, "choices": ["he/she is sure to have cardiovascular problems", "he/she may be in a state of poor health", "he/she must be in danger of heart disease", "he/she might get on poorly with others"], "question": "Getting enough sleep on a regular basis is one important way to protect the health of your heart. Poor sleep is associated with a range of cardiovascular  problems, including high blood pressure, heart attack, and heart failure. Both men and women are at increased risk for these conditions. But we continue to learn that when it comes to health problems associated with sleep, the particular risks to men and women are not always the same. A new study suggests that for women who already have heart disease, poor sleep may be particularly dangerous to their heart health. Research indicates that poor-quality sleep--and waking too early in particular--is associated with increased inflammation  among women with heart disease. There was no similar association found for men, suggesting that women with heart disease and sleep problems may be at particular risk for inflammation that can be damaging to the heart. Researchers at the University of California, San Francisco investigated the relationship between sleep quality and inflammation linked to coronary  heart disease. They also sought information about how an association between sleep and inflammation might differ between men and women. Their investigation included 980 men and women at first, and 626 completed the 5-year study. All of those included were suffering for coronary heart disease. The average age of men in the study was 66. Women were slightly younger, with an average age of 64. Researchers measured sleep quality by asking participants to rate their sleep over the previous month. They also asked for reports of some of the most common sleep problems, including difficulty falling asleep, difficulty staying asleep, waking frequently throughout the night, and waking too early in the morning. After 5 years, researchers repeated tests for inflammation and once again sought reports on sleep quality and sleep problems. When they analyzed data for both men and women together, researchers found no links between inflammations and sleep quality.

It has vowed to make the city's water match its status as a world class city. \"The current tap water quality meets national standards, but, compared with that of the European Union and the United States, it still needs to be improved.\" said the SWA's director general, Hang Jiayi. In other developed countries, water fountains can be found almost everywhere--people do not bother with bottled drinking water. By 2020, the water of the Huangpu River will be treated to reduce the amount of organic waste in it. Major water works that draw water from the Huangpu will need more treatment facilities to improve the colour, texture, ammonia and nitrogen content before 2010. These treatment facilities are expected to cost 4 billion yuan, something that could affect the price of water, according to Chen Yin, SWA's deputy director general. Chen said that replacing water pipes was also a key project. The city's aged pipes are mostly to blame for the bad water quality. The SWA has started the water facilities renovation work, including the more than 14,000 kilometres of indoor piping, 107,000 tanks on top of the buildings, and more than 6,000 underground facilities. World Water Day came on March 22, and this year's theme is \"Water for the future\". Beijing is also drawing up plans during China's Water Week, which runs until March 28.

It has vowed to make the city's water match its status as a world class city. \"The current tap water quality meets national standards, but, compared with that of the European Union and the United States, it still needs to be improved.\" said the SWA's director general, Hang Jiayi. In other developed countries, water fountains can be found almost everywhere--people do not bother with bottled drinking water. By 2020, the water of the Huangpu River will be treated to reduce the amount of organic waste in it. Major water works that draw water from the Huangpu will need more treatment facilities to improve the colour, texture, ammonia and nitrogen content before 2010. These treatment facilities are expected to cost 4 billion yuan, something that could affect the price of water, according to Chen Yin, SWA's deputy director general. Chen said that replacing water pipes was also a key project. The city's aged pipes are mostly to blame for the bad water quality.

The whip gets all of the attention, but it's mostly for show. In reality, it's the chair that does the important work. When a lion tamer holds a chair in front of the lion's face, the lion tries to focus on all four legs of the chair at the same time. With its focus divided, the lion becomes confused and is unsure about what to do next. When faced with so many options, the lion chooses to freeze and wait instead of attacking the man holding the chair. How often do you find yourself in the same position as the lion? How often do you have something you want to achieve (e.g. lose weight, start a business, travel more)--only to end up confused by all of the options in front of you and never make progress? This upsets me to no end because while all the experts are busy debating about which option is best, the people who want to improve their lives are left confused by all of the conflicting information.

The physicist, Dario Auterio, did not try to explain what the results might mean for the laws of physics, let alone the broader world.After an hour of technical talk, he simply said, \"Therefore, we present to you today this difference, this unusualness.\" But what unusualness it may be.From 2009 through 2011, the massive OPERA detector  buried in a mountain in Gran Sasso, Italy, recorded subatomic particles called neutrinos ( ) arriving faster than light can move in an empty space.The neutrinos generated at CERN are hardly detectably early.If confirmed, the finding would throw more than a century of physics into disorder. \"If it's correct, it's _ .\" said Rob Plunkett, a scientist at Fermilab, the Department of Energy physics laboratory in Illinois.\"We'd be looking at a whole new set of rules\" for how the universe works.Those rules would bend, or possibly break, Albert Einstein's special theory of relativity, published in 1905.Basical at the time, the theory tied together space and time, matter and energy, and set a hard limit for the speed of light, later measured to be about 186, 000 miles per second. No experiment in 106 years had broken that speed limit.Physicists expect strict study to follow, which OPERA and CERN scientists welcomed. Fermilab operates a similar experiment, called MINOS, that shoots neutrinos from Illinois to an underground detector in Minnesota.In 2007, MINOS discovered a just detectable amount of faster than-light neutrinos, but the permissible difference of error was too big to \"mention\" , Plunkett said. Fermilab scientists will reanalyze their data, which will take six to eight months.In 2013, the MINOS detector, now offline, will restart after an upgrade.It could then offer confirmation of the results.

The physicist, Dario Auterio, did not try to explain what the results might mean for the laws of physics, let alone the broader world.After an hour of technical talk, he simply said, \"Therefore, we present to you today this difference, this unusualness.\" But what unusualness it may be.From 2009 through 2011, the massive OPERA detector  buried in a mountain in Gran Sasso, Italy, recorded subatomic particles called neutrinos ( ) arriving faster than light can move in an empty space.The neutrinos generated at CERN are hardly detectably early.If confirmed, the finding would throw more than a century of physics into disorder. \"If it's correct, it's _ .\" said Rob Plunkett, a scientist at Fermilab, the Department of Energy physics laboratory in Illinois.\"We'd be looking at a whole new set of rules\" for how the universe works.Those rules would bend, or possibly break, Albert Einstein's special theory of relativity, published in 1905.Basical at the time, the theory tied together space and time, matter and energy, and set a hard limit for the speed of light, later measured to be about 186, 000 miles per second. No experiment in 106 years had broken that speed limit.Physicists expect strict study to follow, which OPERA and CERN scientists welcomed. Fermilab operates a similar experiment, called MINOS, that shoots neutrinos from Illinois to an underground detector in Minnesota.In 2007, MINOS discovered a just detectable amount of faster than-light neutrinos, but the permissible difference of error was too big to \"mention\" , Plunkett said. Fermilab scientists will reanalyze their data, which will take six to eight months.In 2013, the MINOS detector, now offline, will restart after an upgrade.It could then offer confirmation of the results.

This is when a bone is bent and breaks along only one side,like a young stick of wood.Another kind of break is an open or compound fracture.This is when the bone breaks the skin.

Each night the six Zapps either sleep in or around a tent set up next to their car, but more often than not they find a friendly local who will put them up for the night.The only hard rule the couple have to stick by, is the 40mph speed limit the 83-year old car is restricted to. Their trip is supported with the money coming from selling books they write about the places they visit. Where do the Zapps keep their kids?", "subject": ""}

{"answer": 1, "choices": ["Teachers.", "Students.", "Residents.", "Parents."], "question": "Community service is an important component of education here at our university. We encourage all students to volunteer for at least one community activity before they graduate. A new community program called \"One On One\" helps elementary students who've fallen behind. Your education majors might be especially interested in it because it offers the opportunity to do some teaching, that is, tutoring in math and English.   You'd have to volunteer two hours a week for one semester. You can choose to help a child with math, English, or both. Half-hour lessons are fine, so you could do a half hour of each subject two days a week.   Professor Dodge will act as a mentor to the tutors-he'll be available to help you with lesson plans or to offer suggestions for activities. He has office hours every Tuesday and Thursday afternoon. You can sign up for the program with him and begin the tutoring next week.   I'm sure you'll enjoy this community service...and you'll gain valuable experience at the same time.

The result: More kids under age 12 are suffering injuries or, worse, burnout.

However, by the time she meets him, the story turns out to be a somewhat exaggerated legend where the \"bitten-off leg\" turns out to be just being some bad scarring on his leg; a \"love bite\" as Mick calls it. Still _ by the idea of \"Crocodile Dundee\", Sue continues with the story. They travel together out to where the incident occurred, and follow his route through the bush to the nearest hospital. Despite his old-fashioned views, the pair eventually become close, especially after Mick saves Sue from a crocodile attack. Feeling there is still more to the story, Sue invites Mick back to New York with her, as his first trip to a city (or \"first trip anywhere,\" as Dundee says). The rest of the film depicts Dundee as a \"fish out of water,\" showing how, despite his expert knowledge of living outdoors, he knows little of city life. Mick meets Sue's boyfriend, Richard, but they do not get along. By the end of the film, Mick is on his way home, lovesick, when Sue realizes she loves Mick, too, and not Richard.

Ministers are aware that the change in the law will be as controversial as the law which legalized abortion  more than 30 years ago. Some politicians reacted angrily , arguing that the government had already made up its mind without discussion.

The cloning of human embryos to provide spare parts is regarded by most experts to be the most important step forward in the 21stcentury medicine. Scientists say treatment of diseases such as Alzheimer's and Parkinson's will be the first application of cloning. The ability to clone embryos was first achieved by scientists in Scotland in the late 1990s and now the ability to grow stem cells into tissues and organs is being developed by American researchers. Combining the two technologies will mean an end to long waits for organs from donors and problems caused by rejection   of transplanted tissues by the body.

If everybody else is spreading rumors,you might feel you have to do the same thing in order to fit in.Unfortunately,the person who the gossip or rumor is about is usually let out of the group for the same reason that you're let into it. When you know a secret that nobody knows,or are the first person in your group to hear a rumor,it can make you the center of attention.A rumor or piece of gossip is sometimes like money;telling it to people is like buying their attention. _ You probably know at least one person who wishes to be the leader,and make all the decisions.One way they do this is by reducing the status of another person.Spreading rumors and gossip is one way people reduce another person's status.

Only about one-third of fourth grade students are \"proficient\" in reading and another one-third scored below \"basic\" in reading skills.

The names of the invited on the awards night have also been kept secret while in earlier years the Academy made presenters to the ceremony public before weeks. TheNewYorkTimesreported on Monday that the producers are trying to improve the show by asking studios to provide scenes from films. At the same time Ganis also advised nominees to give some thought to make their acceptance speeches memorable-and short. \"As for the acceptance speeches-you know what's required,\" Ganis said.\"Be brief,be personal and be heartfelt. _ \" This year's Oscars are expected to be a great event. Many films will touch you,\"Slumdog Millionaire\"has 10 nominations,and \"The Curious Case of Benjamin Button\" with 13.In the past the film with the most Oscar nominations is the one that has succeeded in box office.

This could have resulted in disaster, since a small piece of food could have stuck in the air vents and other equipment.

He adds that this year, scientists will test another 60 volunteers and will be in a better position to explain the results. One explanation is that women's sense of smell developed long ago, and is linked to recognizing the smell of babies. Scientists used to believe that mothers recognized their children by sight only.

In a scientific study, doctors asked 20 men and 20 women to keep their hands in very hot water for as long as possible while breathing in different smells. As people believe that strong smells can affect the senses, volunteers were asked not to eat or drink for eight hours before the experiment began. During the experiment, volunteers were asked to take in pleasant smells such as vanilla  , and unpleasant smells such as durians  . The volunteers kept their hands in the water until it became too hot for them. When they could not bear the pain any more, they took their hands out of the water.

An example at hand is the involvement of parents in the lives of their children who are attending college.

The same surveys also indicate that the rate of parental involvement is greater today than it was a generation ago. This is usually interpreted as a sign that today's parents are trying to manage their children's lives past the point where this behavior is appropriate. However, greater parental involvement does not necessarily indicate that parents are failing to let go of their \"adult\" children. In the context   of this discussion, it seems valuable to first find out the cause of change in the case of parents' involvement with their grown children. If parents of earlier generations had wanted to be in touch with their college-age children frequently, would this have been possible? Probably not. On the other hand, does the possibility of frequent communication today mean that the urge to do so wasn't present a generation ago? Many studies show that older parents - today's grandparents - would have called their children more often if the means and cost of doing so had not been a barrier. Furthermore, studies show that finances are the most frequent subject of communication between parents and their college children.

It was a nice smile --warm and reassuring -- and I returned her _ by smiling back. \"Must be a special lady, whoever it is that will be getting those beautiful flowers,\" she said. \"Yes, she' s special,\" I said, and then to my embarrassment, the words kept coming out. \"It' s only our second date,but somehow I am just having the feeling she's 'the one' ,\"Jokingly, I added, \"The only problem is that I can' t figure out why she' d want to date a guy like me.\" \"Well, I think she's very lucky to have a boyfriend who brings her such lovely flowers and who is obviously in love with her,\" the woman said. \"My husband used to bring me flowers every week -- even when times were tough and we didn' t have much money. Those were incredible days; he was very romantic and -- of course -- I miss him since he' s passed away.\" I paid for my flowers as she was gathering up her groceries. There was no doubt in my mind as I walked up to her. I touched her on the shoulder and said, \"You were right, you know. These flowers are indeed for a very special lady.\" I handed her the flowers and thanked her for such a nice conversation. It took her a moment to realize that I was giving her the flowers I had just purchased.\"You have a wonderful evening,\" I said. I left her with a big smile and my heart warmed as I saw her smelling the beautiful flowers. I remember being slightly late for my date that night and telling my girlfriend the above story. A couple of years later,when I finally worked up the courage to ask her to marry me,she told me that this story had helped to _ it for her -- that was the night that I won her heart. What is the message conveyed in the story?", "subject": ""}

Whether cable or mobile broadband, today's connections are many times faster than those in the early days. Videos play smoothly, complex websites load quickly, and files download much faster than ten years ago. And the files are much bigger too. There's _ , of course: You have to live near enough to a major city to get broadband Internet. If you don't, it's slow dial-up access for you. And for those living really far out, there may be no Internet access at all. Technology experts often talk about the \"last mile\" problem, which refers to the difficulty of bringing Internet access to remote locations. In cities and suburbs, it's relatively easy to provide access for everyone. It is much more difficult to deliver access to those living far from cities, especially in developing countries. Internet service providers, for their part, have been reluctant to provide access to sparsely   populated areas. The handful of Internet users they would reach wouldn't cover the expense. But every year, technological advancements allow of more and more Internet users. Most broadband connections today run over existing cable TV and telephone lines although these technologies aren't available everywhere. Some companies have delivered the Internet over standard power lines. Advancements in cheaper, more efficient fiber optics cables   promise to bring extremely fast Internet connections to more users. Still, the \"last mile\" problem remains hard to deal with. There will always be somewhere that doesn't have an affordable broadband connection. But someday that might not matter. If the rapid progress in cell phone technology is any indication  , it may not be too long before an Internet connection simply follows you wherever you go. What may eventually settle the \"last mile\" problem?", "subject": ""}

You wish you could just turn your brain off as if it were a light. That would make things much easier, wouldn't it? Now it looks like you are one step closer to this wild dream of yours-scientists from Oxford University, UK have just discovered the \"switch\" that tells the brain to go to sleep, reported Forbes. To understand the study, you first need to know that there are two mechanisms  that regulate sleep. There's one that we're already familiar with --our body clock, which works in a 24-hour cycle based on the light changes throughout the day. The other one is what scientists call the sleep \"homeostat \". This mechanism has nothing to do with daylight. Instead, it keeps track of the brain's waking hours and urges it to rest if it has been awake for a long time. \"It is similar to the thermostat  in your home. A thermostat measures temperature and switches on the heating if it's too cold,\" Professor Gero Miesenbock, who led the study, told The Telegraph. Our bodies use both of the mechanisms to regulate sleep. \"The body clock says it's the right time, and the sleep thermostat has built up pressure during a long waking day,\" explained Miesenbock. There is no way that scientists can trick the body clock. But with the sleep homeostat, there might be something they can do. The researchers found that the sleep homeostat works by activating a specific group of nerve cells, or neurons, in the brain. They tested their theory on fruit flies by removing the neurons from the insects' brains. And as expected, they found that the flies without the homeostat neurons did not keep a regular sleep pattern anymore. Now that scientists have pinpointed the exact place in the brain-- or, the \"switch\"--that regulates sleep, they can begin investigating how to activate these cells at any given time so that people can be sent to sleep instantly. More importantly, figuring out how sleep mechanisms work may also help us to one day one of the oldest mysteries of all: why do we need to sleep in the first place?

They point to jobs such as secretary or truck driver, which often pay more to start than of a teacher. In many other fields, such as law, medicine, computer science, a beginning worker may make more than a teacher who has taught for several years. Teaching has never been a profession that attracted people interested in high salaries. It is by history a profession that has provided rewards in addition to money--the satisfaction of sharing knowledge, of influencing others, of guiding young people. But in the past several years, there are more difficulties in teaching, for many, than there are rewards. Unruly students, especially in big cities, large classes and a lack of support from the public in terms of money and understanding have led many public school teachers to leave the profession. As a result, many of the best students, who would have chosen teaching as their life career in the past, are going into other fields. Another reason for this change in teacher candidates is the changing status of women in the United States. Until the late 1960s and 1970s, one of the most popular choices for women was teaching. But as other professions, such as law and medicine opened up to women, women stopped pouring into teacher training programs. Thus, a major pool of excellent candidates for the teaching profession dwindled. Bit by bit government officials and others realized that the status of the teacher had suffered.

However, actually using a cell phone while driving can be life-threatening. Studies have shown that new drivers are especially prone   to have an accident when they use a cell phone while driving. The reason for this is that new drivers have less experience in concentrating on driving during distractions  . Also, several studies done on teen drivers found that many teens often send text messages while driving. Since text messaging involves both the hands and the eyes, this is thought to be more distracting and dangerous than when drivers use a cell phone only for speaking and listening while driving. All drivers who use a cell phone while driving are reported to be at least four times more likely to have an accident than drivers who don't use a cell phone while driving. Such studies have inspired many countries, including the United States, to have at least some bans on hand-held cell phone use while driving.

The number of families today with just one dependent child is now 47 percent and will likely rise to more than 50 percent in a decade. As the ONS confirms, \"It appears that families are getting smaller.\" One obvious reason for this could be that women are putting off having children until they have established careers when they are bound to be less fertile. But it could just as well be a matter of choice. Parents must consider the rising cost of living, combined with economic uncertainty and an increasingly difficult job market.

Many of our conversations are gossip . I have noticed three effects of gossip: it can hurt people, it can give gossipers a strange kind of satisfaction, and it can cause social pressures in a group. An important negative effect of gossip is that it can hurt the person being talked about. Usually, gossip spreads information about a topic--breakups, troubles at home, even dropping out--that a person would rather keep secret. The more embarrassing or shameful the secret is, the juicer the gossip it makes. Probably the worst type of gossip is the absolute lie. People often think of gossipers as harmless, bur cruel lies can cause pain. If we know that gossip can be harmful, then why do so many of us do it? The answer lies in another effect of gossip: the satisfaction it gives us. Sharing the latest rumor can make a person feel important because he or she knows something that others don't.

{"answer": 1, "choices": ["Neutral.", "Sceptical.", "Objective.", "Supportive."], "question": "Old Fossils Scientists have found what they think is probably the oldest fossil on Earth, a remnant of life from 3.7 billion years ago when Earth's skies were orange and its oceans green. In a newly melted part of Greenland, Australian scientists found the leftover structure from a community of microbes  that lived on an ancient seafloor. Based on their analysis of the fossils, the researchers determined that they are 220 million years older than those discovered in Western Australia, which were 3.48 billion years old. The discovery shows life may have formed quicker and more easily than once thought, about half a billion years after Earth formed. And that may also give hope for life forming elsewhere, such as Mars, said study co-author Martin VanKranendonk of the University of New South Wales and director of the Australian Center for Astrobiology. \"It gives us an idea how our planet evolved and how life gained a foothold,\" VanKranendonk said. Scientists had thought it would take at least half a billion years for life to form after the molten Earth started to cool a bit, but this shows it could have happened quicker, he said.

In a newly melted part of Greenland, Australian scientists found the leftover structure from a community of microbes  that lived on an ancient seafloor. Based on their analysis of the fossils, the researchers determined that they are 220 million years older than those discovered in Western Australia, which were 3.48 billion years old. The discovery shows life may have formed quicker and more easily than once thought, about half a billion years after Earth formed. And that may also give hope for life forming elsewhere, such as Mars, said study co-author Martin VanKranendonk of the University of New South Wales and director of the Australian Center for Astrobiology. \"It gives us an idea how our planet evolved and how life gained a foothold,\" VanKranendonk said. Scientists had thought it would take at least half a billion years for life to form after the molten Earth started to cool a bit, but this shows it could have happened quicker, he said.

For instance, an outdoor person might overstate the size and number of the fish he caught in order to convince himself and others of his talents. In the same way, a student might become so upset upon learning that she failed a test that she would be unable ( Perhaps \" unwilling\" is a better word) to understand clearly where she went wrong. Indeed, psychological noise is a very important communication problem.   But the linear model, despite its advantages, suggests that communication flows in one direction, from sender to receiver. Although some types of messages ( printed and broadcast messages, for example) do flow in a one-way, linear manner, most types of communication, especially the interpersonal variety are two-way exchanges. To put it differently, the linear view ignores the fact that receivers react to massages by sending other messages of their own.   Consider, for example, the meaning of a friend's yawn as you describe your romantic problems. Or imagine the hot face you may see as you tell one of your dirty jokes to a new friend. Nonverbal behaviors like these show that most face-to-face communication is a two-way affair. The discernible  response of a receiver to sender's massage is called feedback. Not all feedback is nonverbal, of course. Sometimes it is oral, as when you ask an instructor questions about an upcoming test or volunteer your opinion of a friend's new haircut.

The Dutch research is one of three human studies that give strong scientific support to the long held belief that eating fish can provide health benefits, particularly to the heart.

{"answer": 2, "choices": ["coffee is of much higher production than tea", "tea and coffee are from harvested leaves of plants", "the popularity of tea is growing constantly in the US", "there is no regional difference in drinking tea and coffee"], "question": "Tea  vs Coffee Tea and coffee are two of the most widely consumed drinks in the United States. With popularity and interest in tea continuing to grow in recent years, many consumers have recently considered making the switch from coffee to tea, if they have not done so already. All the buzz surrounding tea and coffee may have you wondering, what are the differences? As it turns out, the differences are many and varied. In the US, interest in tea ranges from coast to coast with the highest in Hawaii and California but stretching to the eastern states of Vermont and New York. On the other hand, the highest interest in coffee tends to be concentrated more in the north and western regions , with the highest search volumes appearing in the states of Hawaii, Washington and Minnesota. Differences between tea and coffee also vary in origin and production. All tea comes from the harvested leaves of the Camellia sinensis plant, while there are about 60 different species of coffee plants. Production of tea is quicker and more efficient: Camellia sinensis plants only need to grow for three years before they are ready to process; coffee plants take up to five years. Perhaps the most concerning issue consumers have when considering making the switch to tea is the question of caffeine. The good news is, when it comes to tea and caffeine, there is something for everyone. Unlike coffee, which typically only comes in decaffeinated and regular, there are several varieties of tea available, based on caffeine preference. From herbal teas that are naturally free of caffeine, to high quality green and black teas that offer less than half the caffeine of coffee, to high caffeine teas such as our specially formulated HiCAF(r) blends that contain slightly more caffeine than a cup of coffee, there is a variety sure to suit your needs. As an added bonus, the lower acidity levels in tea tend to be gentler on the stomach for a more comforting pick-me-up. So what is the answer, coffee or tea? If you are looking for the most healthful benefit possible, tea is probably the winner. They say a picture is worth a thousand words.

{"answer": 0, "choices": ["get men to take on some housework", "get men to serve their families", "praise men' housework", "make men do all the housework"], "question": "How do you get a man to do his share of the housework? If you are like most women, you've faced this question the hard way. A man will enjoy a clean, orderly house, but he usually won't make the effort to clean or organise it. This doesn't mean that a woman has to do all the housework:; she may have to manage many of the household duties, and request her partner's participation . A woman can often say that men and women should take equal responsibility  for housework. Very few men are raised to be fully responsible for housework, and many men look on housework as women's work. On the other hand, most men will readily work around the yard, make repairs and complete projects on weekends or evenings, and it's important that you give your man appreciation for those things, too.

Ben is most famous for his questions about electricity, hut he also experimented with many other ideas in nature.     In 1743. Ben observed that northeast storms begin in the southwest. He thought it was strange that storms travel in an opposite direction to their winds. He predicted that a storm's course could be charted  . Ben rode a horse through a storm and chased a whirlwind three-quarters of a mile in order to learn more about storms. So, in a way, Ben was a weatherman too!     Since Ben spent so much time sailing go Europe across the Atlantic Ocean, he became very interested in both ocean currents and shipbuilding .Ben was actually one of the first people to chart the Gulf Stream.     In November of 1783. Ben happened to be in Paris, France, working on a peace tre\"0'   to end the American war against England. From his hotel window. he was able to watch the world's first known hot-air balloon flight. The balloon lifted the Montgolfier brothers off the ground as the first human beings ever known to fly. Ben ,vas very interested in the idea of flight, predicting that one day balloons would be used for milita0 ( ) spy flights and dropping bombs during battle. Soon. balloons were actually being used for entertainment. military, and scientific purposes. Even though they could not yet be steered, many people volunteered to take a ride just for fun! Sadly, Ben Franklin died three years before the first American hot-air balloon voyage.

I know you were unhappy along with others in line. Please, accept my apology. I remember you from the store last week. I was so mean to you, when you were doing your job to the best of your ability. I acted so childishly. Please accept my apology. You see, I arrived home from work just yesterday and discovered that my wife had left me, but I should never have taken it out on you. Please, accept my apology. The above are imagined incidents, and yet they expressed a very real truth. The old saying about judging others before you \"have walked a mile in their shoes\" is a much needed reminder. Perhaps we all could try to learn the fact that there are problems and situation in the lives of others which we are totally unaware of. So, maybe before we get angry in similar situations, we should think a moment and understand that things may be going on in other's lives which have caused them to be slower, absent-minded or angry. Patience, as they say, is a virtue. What does the author mainly want to express?", "subject": ""}

I need a warm, comfortable, undisturbed bed of my own. I need it badly. I need all telephones to be thrown down the nearest well, that's what I need.

I am a ministering angel in a Mini with a heavy coat and a bag of medicines.

I wish I were on the beach in southern France. Call me a bad doctor if you like. Call me what you will.

{"answer": 3, "choices": ["A uniform of McKay.", "A footnote about McKay.", "A book on McKay.", "A picture of McKay."], "question": "Eddie McKay, a once-forgotten pilot, is a subject of great interest to a group of history students in Canada. It all started when Graham Broad, a professor at the University of Western Ontario, found McKay's name in a footnote in a book about university history. McKay was included in a list of university alumni   who had served during the First World War, but his name was unfamiliar to Broad, a specialist in military history. Out of curiosity, Broad spent hours at the local archives   in a fruitless search for information on McKay. Tired and discouraged, he finally gave up. On his way out, Broad's glance happened to fall on an exhibiting case showing some old newspapers. His eye was drawn to an old picture of a young man in a rugby uniform. As he read the words beside the picture, he experienced a thrilling realization. \"After looking for him all day, there he was, staring up at me out of the exhibiting case,\" said Broad. Excited by the find, Broad asked his students to continue his search. They combed old newspapers and other materials for clues. Gradually, a picture came into view. Captain Alfred Edwin McKay joined the British Royal Flying Corps in 1916. He downed ten enemy planes, outlived his entire squadron   as a WWI flyer, spent some time as a flying instructor in England, then returned to the front, where he was eventually shot down over Belgium and killed in December 1917. But there's more to his story. \"For a brief time in 1916 he was probably the most famous pilot in the world,\" says Broad. \"He was credited with downing Oswald Boelcke, the most famous German pilot at the time.\" Yet, in a letter home, McKay refused to take credit, saying that Boelcke had actually crashed into another German plane. McKay's war records were destroyed during a World War II air bombing on London -- an explanation for why he was all but forgotten. But now, thanks to the efforts of Broad and his students, a marker in McKay's memory was placed on the university grounds in November 2007. \"I found my eyes filling with tears as I read the word 'deceased'   next to his name,\" said Corey Everrett, a student who found a picture of Mckay in his uniform. \"This was such a simple example of the fact that he had been a student just like us, but instead of finishing his time at Western, he chose to fight and die for his country.\" What made Professor Broad continue his search for more information on McKay?", "subject": ""}

She said the day was great for students to learn what they could do. \"Space is one of those great things that get kids excited, but it also gives them the chance to do so much. They can be an astronaut; they can be an engineer, \"She said. The day was held in honour of Chris Hadfield, a Canadian astronaut now in the Internal Space Station. \"It gives kids someone more to look up to. Here's a real hero to look up to who's doing it all, doing it through education,\" said Nickel. Jordan Schott thinks it's really cool. \"To me it seems so cool how people can go up to space, and science is something I've always liked,\" She said. Schott says she wants to follow in the footsteps of Hadfield and be an astronaut when she gets older. One of the winning experiments in the competition was produced by students from Argyle, Manitoba. It will travel to the space station in the fall of 2013. What's the main idea of the text?", "subject": ""}

They can also be used when disabled people are being dropped off or picked up. Disabled people can even use them to park without having to pay. Parking officials think that some people are cheating. Not all people who have these placards are disabled. Today, one in sixteen drivers in California carries the sign. There are a lot more people who have disabled placards today than ten years ago. An official from the DMV  says that there are many reasons for the increase. As people get older, they may develop health problems and need to have one. There are also other reasons why more drivers have them today. Finally, there are a number of people who have them that should not. Last year the DMV cancelled more than 25,000 permits. They found that lots of people who had the disabled placards had died. These permits are no longer valid. Some people are worried that the system is being abused. They are worried that access to the program could be limited because of the misuse. More rules could make it harder for people with real disabilities to get these placards.

Some people get off to sleep as soon as their head hits the pillow, but  many others are not so lucky. In fact, the lack of quality sleep has become a public health issue around the world. According to me World Association of Sleep Medicine, 45 percent of the world's population suffer from sleep problems. One in eight people don't sleep well and are easily woken. 7.6 percent sleep less than 3 hours each night. Some even cannot fall asleep for several days in a row. As a basic bodily and mental need, sleep is essential for our survival, it helps us to fight diseases, strengthen our memory, perform better in work and school and improve our quality of life. Lack of sleep is known to have a significant negative influence on health, both in the short and long term. Poor sleep has been associated with obesity, diabetes, weakened immune systems and even some cancers, as well as depression and anxiety. The World Sleep Day, held on the third Friday of March, is an annual celebration of sleep to lighten the burden of sleep problems through better prevention and management of sleep disorders. To achieve this goal, we must figure out what causes sleepiness and sleeplessness. Unhealthy lifestyle may be the first to blame. More and more people use cell phones and computers in bed, with many staying up until midnight. Modern technology does make our life convenient, but abuse of it ruins our health. Environmental conditions, such as temperature, noise, light, bed comfort also play an important Pole in one's ability to get proper sleep. Besides, improper evening diet, like a full or an empty stomach, coffee and alcohol all contribute to sleep problems. Of course, when it comes to causing poor sleep, stress from finances, family or work should never be ignored. However, those who suffer from sleep disorders don't necessarily have to continue to do so -most sleep problems can be managed.

Some thinkers say, \"Happiness does not lie in the objects of enjoyment; happiness or unhappiness lies in the imagination.\" To prove their belief they give examples like the following one.

The advice provided below will help make sure that the fish you release will survive   to bite again another day. --When catching a fish, play it quickly and keep the fish in the water as much as possible. Don't' use a net in landing the fish and release it quickly to prevent it from dying. --Hold the fish gently. Do not put your fingers in its eyes. Don't wipe the scales   off the   fish because it might cause it to develop a disease and reduce its chance of survival. --Remove your hook   quickly. If the hook is too deep or hooked in the stomach, cut the   line and leave the hook in. The hook left inside will cause no serious problem to the fish. --Take good care of the fish by moving it gently in water . Release the fish when it begins to   struggle and is able to swim. --Do not hold fish in a bucket or some other containers and later decide to release it. If you are   going to release a fish, do so right away. With a little care and by following the suggestions given above, you can give the released fish a better chance of survival.

{"answer": 0, "choices": ["because Allie is anxious about talking about leaving", "Because Allie is tired of the author's suggestion", "Because the author is angry with Allie's rudeness", "because there is a generation gap between them"], "question": "My daughter Allie is leaving for college in a week. Her room is cluttered   with shopping bags filled with blankets, towels, jeans, sweaters. She won't talk about going. I say, \"I'm going to miss you,\" and she gives me one of her looks and leaves the room. Another time I say, in a voice so friendly it surprises even me: \"Do you think you'll take your posters and pictures with you, or will you get new ones at college?\" She answers, her voice filled with annoyance, \"How should I know?\" My daughter is off with friends most of the time. Yesterday was the last day she'd have until Christmas with her friend Katharine, whom she's known since kindergarten. Soon, it will be her last day with Sarah, Claire, Heather... and then it will be her last day with me. My friend Karen told me, \"The August before I left for college, I screamed at my mother the whole month. Be prepared.\" I stand in the kitchen, watching Allie make a glass of iced tea. Her face, once so open and trusting, is closed to me. I struggle to think of something to say to her, something meaningful and warm. I want her to know I'm excited about the college she has chosen, that I know the adventure of her life is just starting and that I am proud of her. But the look on her face is so mad that I think she might slug me if I open my mouth. One night -- after a long period of silence between us -- I asked what I might have done or said to make her angry with me. She sighed and said, \"Mom, you haven't done anything. It's fine.\" It is fine -- just distant. Somehow in the past we had always found some way to connect. When Allie was a toddler , I would go to the day- care center after work. I'd find a quiet spot and she would nurse -- our eyes locked together, reconnecting with each other. In middle school, when other mothers were already lamenting the estrangement they felt with their adolescent daughters, I hit upon a solution: rescue raids. I would show up occasionally at school, sign her out of class and take her somewhere -- out to lunch, to the movies, once for a long walk on the beach. It may sound irresponsible, but it kept us close when other mothers and daughters were floundering. We talked about everything on those outings -- outings we kept secret from family and friends. When she started high school, I'd get up with her in the morning to make her a sandwich for lunch, and we'd silently drink a cup of tea together before the 6:40 bus came. A couple of times during her senior year I went into her room at night, the light off, but before she went to sleep. I'd sit on the edge of her bed, and she'd tell me about problems: a teacher who lowered her grade because she was too shy to talk in class, a boy who teased her, a friend who had started smoking. Her voice, coming out of the darkness, was young and questioning. A few days later I'd hear her on the phone, repeating some of the things I had said, things she had adopted for her own. But now we are having two kinds of partings. I want the romanticized version, where we go to lunch and lean across the table and say how much we will miss each other. I want smiles through tears, bittersweet moments of reminiscence and the chance to offer some last bits of wisdom. But as she prepares to depart, Allie's feelings have gone underground. When I reach to touch her arm, she pulls away. She turns down every invitation I extend. She lies on her bed, reading Emily Dickinson until I say I have always loved Emily Dickinson, and then she closes the book. Some say the tighter your bond with your child, the greater her need to break away, to establish her own identity in the world. The more it will hurt, they say. A friend of mine who went through a difficult time with her daughter but now has become close to her again, tells me,\" Your daughter will be back to you.\" \"I don't know,\" I say. I sometimes feel so angry that I want to go over and shake Allie. I want to say, \"Talk to me -- or you're grounded!\" I feel myself wanting to say that most horrible of all mother phrases: \"Think of everything I've done for you.\" Late one night, as I'm getting ready for bed she comes to the bathroom door and watches me brush my teeth. For a moment, I think I must be brushing my teeth in a way she doesn't approve of. But then she says, \"I want to read you something.\" It's a pamphlet from her college. \"These are tips for parents.\" I watch her face as she reads the advice aloud: \"'Don't ask your child if she is homesick,' it says. 'She might feel bad the first few weeks, but don't let it worry you. This is a natural time of transition. Write her letters and call her a lot. Send a package of goodies...' \" Her voice breaks, and she comes over to me and buries her head in my shoulder. I stroke her hair, lightly, afraid she'll bolt if I say a word.

I'd find a quiet spot and she would nurse -- our eyes locked together, reconnecting with each other. In middle school, when other mothers were already lamenting the estrangement they felt with their adolescent daughters, I hit upon a solution: rescue raids. I would show up occasionally at school, sign her out of class and take her somewhere -- out to lunch, to the movies, once for a long walk on the beach. It may sound irresponsible, but it kept us close when other mothers and daughters were floundering. We talked about everything on those outings -- outings we kept secret from family and friends. When she started high school, I'd get up with her in the morning to make her a sandwich for lunch, and we'd silently drink a cup of tea together before the 6:40 bus came. A couple of times during her senior year I went into her room at night, the light off, but before she went to sleep. I'd sit on the edge of her bed, and she'd tell me about problems: a teacher who lowered her grade because she was too shy to talk in class, a boy who teased her, a friend who had started smoking. Her voice, coming out of the darkness, was young and questioning. A few days later I'd hear her on the phone, repeating some of the things I had said, things she had adopted for her own. But now we are having two kinds of partings. I want the romanticized version, where we go to lunch and lean across the table and say how much we will miss each other. I want smiles through tears, bittersweet moments of reminiscence and the chance to offer some last bits of wisdom. But as she prepares to depart, Allie's feelings have gone underground. When I reach to touch her arm, she pulls away. She turns down every invitation I extend. She lies on her bed, reading Emily Dickinson until I say I have always loved Emily Dickinson, and then she closes the book. Some say the tighter your bond with your child, the greater her need to break away, to establish her own identity in the world. The more it will hurt, they say. A friend of mine who went through a difficult time with her daughter but now has become close to her again, tells me,\" Your daughter will be back to you.\" \"I don't know,\" I say. I sometimes feel so angry that I want to go over and shake Allie. I want to say, \"Talk to me -- or you're grounded!\" I feel myself wanting to say that most horrible of all mother phrases: \"Think of everything I've done for you.\" Late one night, as I'm getting ready for bed she comes to the bathroom door and watches me brush my teeth. For a moment, I think I must be brushing my teeth in a way she doesn't approve of. But then she says, \"I want to read you something.\" It's a pamphlet from her college. \"These are tips for parents.\" I watch her face as she reads the advice aloud: \"'Don't ask your child if she is homesick,' it says. 'She might feel bad the first few weeks, but don't let it worry you. This is a natural time of transition. Write her letters and call her a lot. Send a package of goodies...' \" Her voice breaks, and she comes over to me and buries her head in my shoulder. I stroke her hair, lightly, afraid she'll bolt if I say a word. We stand there together for long moments, swaying. Reconnecting. I know it will be hard again. It's likely there will be a fight about something. But I am grateful to be standing in here at midnight, both of us tried and sad, toothpaste smeared on my chin,  _ .

You can show him that you care about him by playing with him, by petting him and speaking kindly to him and by making sure he has fresh water. It might be best if your dog is not near the dinner table while you are eating. You could teach him to stay in another room. Being Bilingual  My aunt insists that we speak our language(Tagalog) at home and English outside the house. Do you think she is right? Reply from the Highlights Editor: It is a great gift to have someone in your family who is willing to take the time to teach you another language. It's a good way to keep family traditions alive, and it helps develop your language skills. Your ability to use both English and Tagalog will help you learn a third and fourth language later in life. So it sounds like a great idea! The Highlights editors give the replies to   _  .", "subject": ""}

Men and women dash about, talking to small metal devices. Young people sit on sofas, moving miniature athletes around on electronic screens. Airports, hospitals, shopping malls-- every place Rip goes just puzzles him. But when he finally walks into a schoolroom, the old man knows exactly where he is. \"This is a school,\" he declares. \"We used to have these black in 1906. Only now the blackboards are green.\" American schools aren't exactly frozen in time, but considering the pace of change in other areas of life, our public schools tend to feel like throwbacks. Kids spend much of the day as their great-grandparents once did: sitting in rows, listening to teachers lecture, scribbling notes by hand, reading textbooks that are out of date. A yawning chasm separates the world inside the schoolhouse from the world outside. The national conversation on education has long focused on reading scores, math tests and closing the \"achievement gap\". This is not a story about that conversation. This is a story about the big public conversation the nation is not having about education, the one that will ultimately determine whether an entire generation of kids will fail to make the grade in the global economy because they can't think their way through abstract problems, work in teams or speak a language other than English. This week the conversation will burst onto the front page, when the NCSAW releases a blueprint for rethinking American education from pre-K to 12 and beyond to better prepare students  _ in the global economy. While that report includes some debatable proposals, there is a remarkable agreement among educators and business and policy leaders on one key conclusion: we need to bring what we teach and how we teach into the 21st century. Today's economy demands not only a high-level competence in the traditional academic disciplines but also what might be called 21st-century skills.

According to Science Daily, about onethird of the people are likely to prefer shoes to a fun trip. These people are called \"materialists\", namely, those who value material goods more than experiences. But which of the two choices makes people happier? Back in 2009, Ryan Howell, a professor at San Francisco State University, found that in the long run, experiences make people happier than possessions. This is because the joy of receiving a new object fades over time as you get used to seeing it every day. Experiences, on the other hand, can continue to bring you joy in the future through happy memories. But materialists should at least be happy when they first buy something, shouldn't they? To figure it out, Howell did another study. He classified a group of adults according to their personality types, ranging from less materialistic to more materialistic. Each person was asked different questions to see how they felt about spending money on material goods versus spending money on experiences. As expected, the more materialistic participants got less happiness from purchases than the less materialistic, because such purchases didn't fit with their personalities and values. But to Howell's surprise, he found that materialists weren't any happier even if they spent money on material items. This is because materialists worry that others may criticize or look down on their choices. \"There are certain value systems that are rejected by society,\" said Howell. \"When we find out someone is materialistic, we think less of them, and that drives their happiness down.\" Another reason is that materialistic people always focus on what they don't have instead of what they have now. This makes them feel less satisfied and grateful. If you happen to be a materialistic person, there's something you can try. \"If materialists make more accurate purchases, rather than trying to impress others, they will be happier,\" Howell said.

Professor Reilly's team studied over 1600 children from Melbourne, Australia. Their mothers had been filling out regular questionnaires since their babies were eight months old and the children were judged by a range of language and behaviour tests when they reached the age of four. Reilly and her colleagues asked the parents to call the study group if their children started showing signs of stuttering. Diagnoses were confirmed by a researcher, who then visited the homes of children with a stutter every month to check on their progress.

But crying is much more difficult in space, reported The Atlantic in January. Without gravity, tears don't flow downward out of the eyes like they do here on Earth. This means that when you cry in space, your tears have nowhere to go - they just stick to your eyes.

The new rules draw wide concern. Mundine is Prime Minister Tony Abbott's top advisor on issues concerning Aboriginals, native Australians. \"Now, I know the government needs some necessary measures but I think punishing the parents is really the last choice.\" Mr. Mundine says the situation can be changed if the tribal leaders support education. \"We need to work with parents and communities because we are making a huge cultural change here.\" But other officials say they believe the threat of stopping aid will force families to take education more seriously. The State of South Australia says it has special programs for Aboriginal children. The students work with their parents and teachers first to develop a personal learning plan and the public schools provide special workers to work individually with Aboriginal students. At the age of seven, Aboriginal students can join a program called Enter for Success designed to attract students to school. The students can choose which high school to attend and receive support in reaching the goals on their individual learning plans. The State of Western Australia also has special programs for Aboriginal and other ethnic   groups. The state operates a program called Focus Schools which centers on basic skills like reading, writing and counting. 67% of these public focus schools serve the students in 79 very rural areas.

The new rules draw wide concern. Mundine is Prime Minister Tony Abbott's top advisor on issues concerning Aboriginals, native Australians. \"Now, I know the government needs some necessary measures but I think punishing the parents is really the last choice.\" Mr. Mundine says the situation can be changed if the tribal leaders support education. \"We need to work with parents and communities because we are making a huge cultural change here.\" But other officials say they believe the threat of stopping aid will force families to take education more seriously. The State of South Australia says it has special programs for Aboriginal children. The students work with their parents and teachers first to develop a personal learning plan and the public schools provide special workers to work individually with Aboriginal students. At the age of seven, Aboriginal students can join a program called Enter for Success designed to attract students to school. The students can choose which high school to attend and receive support in reaching the goals on their individual learning plans. The State of Western Australia also has special programs for Aboriginal and other ethnic   groups. The state operates a program called Focus Schools which centers on basic skills like reading, writing and counting. 67% of these public focus schools serve the students in 79 very rural areas. Most of them are primary schools. The Focus Schools program also includes 118 coaches working with students in 134 schools.
