He has been called the \" Father of American Scholarship and Education. \" His \" Blue-Backed Speller\" books were used to teach spelling and reading to five generations of American children. But how much .do you know about him beyond that? At the age of 16, Noah Webster began attending ,Yale College. Unfortunately, he spent his four years at Yale during the American Revolutionary War, and, because of food shortages, many of his college classes were held in Glastonbury, Connecticut. Later, he served in the army. Having graduated from Yale in 1778, Webster wanted to continue his education in order to earn his law degree. He had to teach school in order to pay for his education. He set up many small schools that didn't survive, but he was a good teacher because instead of forcing his students to learn, like most teachers did, he rewarded them. He earned his law degree in 1781, but did not practice law until 1789. Once he started he found the law was not to his liking. Webster did not have much money. In 1793 , Alexander Hamilton lent him $ 1500 to move to New York City to edit a newspaper. In December, he founded New York ' s first daily newspaper, American Minerva, and edited it for four years. For decades, he published . textbooks, political essays, a report on some diseases, and newspaper articles for his party, He wrote so much that a modern list of his published works required 655 pages .Noah Webster died on May 28, 1843 and was buried in the Grove Street Cemetery.

For, of course, the microphones were not connected to the tape-recorder in the middle of the room at all but to another one, which was turning happily away in the kitchen. The participants, having seen the visible tape-recorder turned off, paid no more attention to the microphones which stayed in front of their chairs, only a few inches from their mouths, thus giving excellent sound quality. And my lengthy absence meant that I was able to obtain as natural a piece of conversation as it would be possible to find. I should add, perhaps, that I did tell my friends what had happened to them, after the event was over, and gave them the choice of destroying the tape. None of them wanted to--though for some years afterwards it always seemed to be my round when it came to the buying of drinks. Linguistic research can be a very expensive business.

Like any best friend forever, money demonstrated to researchers its ability to _ us, reduce our sense of social exclusion and even reduce life's painful moments. \"I was surprised\" says Katherine Vohs, one of the researchers and professor at the University of Minnesota's Carlson School of Management. \"The findings were surprising because no one had connected the meaning of money to pain. The money wasn't buying the subjects more friends; it was only psychologically helpful.\" In the research ,students were told they would be participating in a test of finger dexterity . One group was given some paper money to count, while the other group was given blank pieces of paper. Once the counting was complete, all the test subjects were asked to dip their fingers into bowls of water heated to 122 degrees--roughly the temperature of a very hot bath. Result? Those who had been counting money reported less pain than those who had not. Subjects also were asked about their feelings. Those who handled actual money reported feeling stronger even 10 minutes after they put down the cash. Combined with previous experiments, the findings confirmed what researchers have long doubted, that money acts as a general panacea  in the brain, giving us social self-confidence and reducing physical pain without having to spend a dime on aspirin. But can we get the same effect by using credit cards? \"No, credit cards do not have the same effect, \" Vohs says. \"They are scary for most people, and they in fact represent debt m many ways.\" The findings could have an interesting effect in the business world, where recent trends have been to issue non-monetary rewards and bonuses instead of what was thought of as \"cold, hard cash\".

This also seems to be true in history. In 1799, scientists studied works of art made at different times from 1,500 B.C. to the 1950s.

Today, only about 10% to 15% of the world's population is left-handed. Why are there more right-handed people than left-handed ones? Scientists now know that a person's two hands each have their own jobs. For most people, the hand is used to find things or hold things. The right hand is used to work with things. This is because of the different work of the two sides of the brain. The right side of the brain, which makes a person's hands and eyes work together, controls the left hand. The left-side of the brain, which controls the right hand, is the centre for thinking and doing problems. These findings show that more artists should be left-handed, and studies have found that left-handedness is twice as common among artists as among people in other jobs. No one really knows what makes a person become right-handed instead of left-handed. Scientists have found that almost 40% of the people become left-handed because their main brain is damaged when they are born. However, this doesn't happen to everyone, so scientists guess there must be another reason why people become left-handed. One idea is that people usually get right-handed from their parents. If a person does not receive the gene  for right-handedness, he / she may become either right-handed or left-handed according to the chance and the people they work or live with.

Today, only about 10% to 15% of the world's population is left-handed. Why are there more right-handed people than left-handed ones? Scientists now know that a person's two hands each have their own jobs. For most people, the hand is used to find things or hold things. The right hand is used to work with things. This is because of the different work of the two sides of the brain. The right side of the brain, which makes a person's hands and eyes work together, controls the left hand. The left-side of the brain, which controls the right hand, is the centre for thinking and doing problems. These findings show that more artists should be left-handed, and studies have found that left-handedness is twice as common among artists as among people in other jobs. No one really knows what makes a person become right-handed instead of left-handed. Scientists have found that almost 40% of the people become left-handed because their main brain is damaged when they are born. However, this doesn't happen to everyone, so scientists guess there must be another reason why people become left-handed. One idea is that people usually get right-handed from their parents. If a person does not receive the gene  for right-handedness, he / she may become either right-handed or left-handed according to the chance and the people they work or live with. Though right-handedness is more common than left-handedness, people no longer think left-handed people are strange or unusual. A long time ago, left-handed children were made to use their right hands like other children, but today they don't have to. The best title for this passage is   _  .", "subject": ""}

Scheduled to leave Kunming at 8:45 p.m., the connecting flight was delayed until 11 p.m. by additional poor weather. This did not make the passengers happy. Several refused to board and demanded compensation, but by 1:45 a.m. the airline had persuaded everyone to board. But that wasn't the end of the passengers' problems. After they boarded, the airport staff had to clear snow from the runway, which took over an hour.

An electromagnetic   field caused by copper coils   will pull small pieces in the smog to the ground where they can be easily cleaned. \"It's like when you have a balloon which has electricity and your hair goes toward it.Same with the smog,\" says artist Daan Roosegaarde.His studio has reached an agreement with the Beijing government to test the technology in one of the capital's parks.With its skies regularly covered by filthy gray smog, Beijing this week announced a series of emergency measures to deal with the problem in public. Roosegaarde says an indoor experiment has already proved it works and he is confident the results--with the help of a team of scientists and engineers--can be copied outside.\"Beijing is quite good because the smog is quite low. It's in a valley so there's not so much wind.It's a good environment to explore this kind of thing.We'll be able to purify the air and the challenge is to get rid of the smog so you can see the sun again.\" Roosegaarde acknowledges that projects like this are a way of drawing attention to the problem, rather than a complete solution to Beijing's serious and terrible air pollution.\"This is not the real answer for smog.The real answer has to do with clean cars, different industry and different lifestyles,\" he says. However, he hopes the project will make a difference by allowing the city's residents to realize the difference between breathing clean and smog-filled air.\"I want to take a park in Beijing, 50m by 50m square, and make it the cleanest park in Beijing,\" he says.He is still discussing with local authorities which park will be used.

And they aren't talking about basset hounds  : those dogs just look as if they expect the worst. What the scientists say is that dogs that exhibit anxiety when left home alone by their owners may have bigger problems -- they may be in a permanent bad mood. This pessimistic outlook may not otherwise be easily apparent in a dog's other characteristics, like running speed or learning ability, the study reports. Dogs are similar to humans in the role that emotional state plays in decision making, said Michael Mendel, a veterinary scientist at the University of Bristol and the study's lead author. The study's researchers looked at 24 dogs in shelters in Britain. They placed the dogs in isolated settings and observed their reactions -- many barked, jumped on furniture and scratched at the door. Then they placed bowls in two rooms. One bowl contained food, while another was empty. After training the dogs to understand that bowls can sometimes be empty, and sometimes full, they began to place bowls in ambiguous locations. Dogs that quickly raced to the locations were more optimistic, and in search of food. Those that did not were deemed pessimistic. The more separation anxiety a dog expressed while in isolation, the more likely the dog was to have a pessimistic reaction, the researchers found.

This peasant had a little daughter to whom he taught the musical alphabet before she knew how to read. Daae was a great musician, perhaps without knowing it. Not a violinist in Scandinavia played as he did. His reputation was widespread and he was always invited to set the couples dancing at weddings and other festivals. His wife died when Christine was entering upon her sixth year. Then the father, who cared only for his daughter and his music, sold his land and went to Upsala in search of fame and fortune. He found nothing but poverty. He returned to the country, wandering from fair to fair, playing his Scandinavian music pieces, while his child, who never left his side, listened to him in delight or sang to his playing. One day, at Ljimby Fair, Professor Valerius heard them and took them to Gothenburg. He insisted that the father was the first violinist in the world and that the daughter had the making of a great artist. Her education and instruction were provided for. She made rapid progress and charmed everybody with her prettiness, her grace of manner and her real eagerness to please. When Valerius and his wife went to settle in France, they took Daae and Christine with them. \"Mamma\" Valerius treated Christine as her daughter. As for Daae, he became ill with homesickness.

Overdeck knew she wanted her own children to be good at math, too. \"And when our first child was about two, we just started giving her a math problem every night,\" Overdeck said. The problem was usually a story, involving animals, cars or candies that let the kid count. \"Our third child started, at age two, yelling that he wanted his own math problem because he saw his brother and sister doing it. And we thought, 'Wow, we have a household where math is the popular thing at bedtime,'\" Overdeck said. In February, Overdeck launched Bedtime Math, an Internet website where she posts daily puzzles for children. Overdeck is particularly keen to hook children on numbers before they go to school. So why introduce little ones to math so early? Sain Beilock, an expert on performance anxiety, says the more fun and familiar math is early on, the less likely children will feel nervous when they start to learn math in school. \"My lab has shown recently that kids as early as first grade report feeling anxious about doing math,\" Beilock said. \"You can hear totally educated adults say, 'You know I'm just not that good at math.' or 'I'm kind of afraid of math.'

Mosquitoes are everywhere. They can be found all over the world, and they come in more than 2,500 species . Somewhere, at some time, you have surely met at least one. No one loves the mosquito. But unfortunately, the mosquito may decide who she loves. She? Yes, she. Do you know that only the female mosquito bites? Well, it's true. And it's not because she is unfriendly; she needs blood to reproduce. Do you know how the female mosquito decides whom to bite? She is quite selective, and she chooses her victims  carefully. First, she uses sensors to find her victim. These sensors are located on her two antennae and her three pairs of legs. With these sensors, she tests your body moisture, body warmth, and chemical substances in your sweat. If she likes what she finds, she bites. But if you are not attractive, she'll reject you for another one. The next time a mosquito bites you, just remember that you are chosen. You are special. If the mosquito likes you, she settles onto your flesh very gently, and she breaks your skin with her long nose tip. Long nose tip? What's that? It's a kind of mouth and it sticks out just below the mosquito's eyes. It contains six sharp instruments called styles.  She thrusts all six styles into your skin at once, and if she hits a blood pipe, she'll get a full dinner in about a minute. All this usually takes place so quickly and quietly that you may not have doubted anything is happening. Why does a mosquito bite itch ? The itch is not really from the bite. lt's from the saliva  the mosquito mixes with your blood to keep it from being blocked as she sucks up her long nose tip. By the time the itch begins, she has gone. And then what happens? Well after her delicious dinner, the mosquito is tired. She just wants to find a place to rest.

If there were a change in the atmosphere -- for example, in the   amounts of atmospheric gases -- the climate would probably change also. A slight increase in water vapor   , for example, would increase the heat-keeping capacity of the atmosphere and would lead to a rise in global temperatures. The level of carbon dioxide, CO2, in the atmosphere has an important effect on climatic change. Most of the Earth's incoming energy is short-wavelength radiation   , which tends to pass through atmospheric CO2easily. The Earth, however, reradiates much of the received energy as long-wavelength radiation  , which CO2absorbs and then goes toward the Earth. This phenomenon, known as the greenhouse effect, can result in an increase in the surface temperature of a planet. An extreme example of the effect is shown by Venus, a planet covered by heavy clouds composed mostly of CO2, whose surface temperatures have been measured at 430~C.If the CO2 content of the atmosphere is reduced, the temperature falls. According to one respectable theory, if the atmospheric CO2concentration were halved, the Earth would become completely covered with ice.  Another equally respectable theory, however, states that a halving of the CO2concentration would lead only to a reduction in global temperatures of 3degC. If, because of an increase in forest fires or volcanic activity, the CO2content of the atmosphere increased, a warmer climate would be produced. Plant growth, which relied on both the warmth and the availability of CO2, would probably increase. As a consequence, plant would use more and more CO2.  Eventually CO2levels would decrease and the climate, in turn, would become cooler. With reduced temperatures many plants would die; CO2would thus be returned to the atmosphere and gradually the temperature would rise again. Thus, if this process occurred, there might be a long-term oscillation   in the amount of CO2present in the atmosphere, with regular temperature increase and decrease. Some climatologists argue that the burning of fossil fuels has raised the level of CO2in the atmosphere and has caused a global temperature increase of at least 1degC. But a supposed global temperature rise of 1 degC may in reality be only several regional temperature increases, restricted to areas where there are many meteorological   stations.

One area in which smells are created to achieve particular results is marketing. For some time producers have taken advantage of our sense of smell with regard to household goods. When pleasant smells are passed through a store's air conditioning system, people tend to spend more time in the store and buy more. For example, the smell of chocolate is used in sweet stores, while the smell of leather and perfume are used in clothes stores. In a test, people looked at the same types of shoes in two rooms--one filled with purified air, the other with a smell of mixed flowers. Eighty-four percent of the people preferred the shoes in the room with the smell of flowers. In fact, many said they would have paid up to US $ 10 more for a pair. Smells also have other uses. Research has shown that certain smells can help to calm anxious people and increase their feeling of safety. Smells such as that of flowers and pine forests might therefore be used to relax patients in doctors' and dentists' waiting rooms, and to make the environment more pleasant and less stressful to _  Some companies are experimenting with different smells to produce different efferent effects on their workers according to the time of day. For example, early in the morning they might put the smell of lemon in the air conditioning system to wake people up. In the middle of the morning, when the atmosphere tends to become more tense, the smell of wood could be used to calm people down. Before lunchtime the smell of melting butter would encourage people to go to lunch on time. After lunch, when people often begin to lose attention, the smell of mint would increase their watchfulness. While some of these uses of smells may e helpful and effective, not everyone would agree with their use to control customers in stores. It has been suggested by consumers' organizations that one way to avoid this new subconscious pressure to buy is to go shopping when people are less likely to be influenced by smells.

The odour of a familiar human apparently lingers like perfume in the animal's brain - where it triggers an instinctive emotional response, research published yesterday reveals. Our scent acts on a part of the canine brain associated with reward and the strongest reactions are produced by humans that pets know best, say scientists in America. Gregory Berns, of Emory University in Atlanta, said: 'While we might expect that dogs should be highly tuned to the smell of other dogs, it seems that the \"reward response\" is reserved for their humans. 'When humans smell the perfume or cologne of someone they love, they may have an immediate, emotional reaction that's not necessarily cognitive. 'Our experiment may be showing the same process in dogs. But since dogs are so much more olfactory  than humans, their responses would likely be even more powerful than the ones we might have. 'It's one thing when you come home and your dog sees you and jumps on you and licks you and knows that good things are about to happen. 'In our experiment, however, the scent donors were not physically present. Why do animals avoid pylons? Because they emit terrifying flashes of light that are INVISIBLE to humans. Dolphins use sponges to protect their sensitive noses while foraging for food on the sea floor 'That means the canine brain responses were being triggered by something distant in space and time. It shows that dogs' brains have these mental representations of us that persist when we're not there.' The university's experiment - the first of its type - involved 12 dogs of various breeds who underwent brain scans while five different scents were placed in front of them. The scent samples came from the subject itself, a dog the subject had never met, a dog that lived in the subject's household, a human the dog had never met, and a human that lived in the subject's household. The familiar human scent samples were taken from someone else from the house other than the handlers during the experiment, so that none of the scent donors were physically present. The results showed that all five scents elicited a similar response in parts of the dogs' brains involved in detecting smells. Responses were significantly stronger for the scents of familiar humans, followed by that of familiar dogs. The findings, which were published in the journal Behavioural Processes, showed that dogs reacted strongest to the scent of a familiar human even when they were not there.

It showed that present economic conditions are discouraging young adults from leaving home and forcing those who have already gone, so-called boomerang kids, to return. \"Parents are continuing their financial involvement longer than we expected,\" said Ted Beck, president of National Endowment for Financial Education (NEFE). About 60 percent of parents questioned in the survey said they're helping their adult children who are no longer in school financially. Half are providing housing and nearly half are helping with living expenses. For an increasing number of adult children, the situation is bad. Two-thirds of adult children, aged 18 to 39, who are not in school said they faced tougher financial pressures than previous generations, according to the survey. And nearly one-third of parents agreed that it was easier for them to find their financial feet than for their children. Parents are helping their children out of genuine concern because they do not want to see them struggle. But Beck said that parents who make sacrifices  to help their adult children should be careful about their own finances. \"If you are taking on extra debt or delaying  retirement to help your adult child, you could be making a mistake and putting your own financial future in danger,\" Beck warned. Boomerang children can also cause other problems for their parents. Thirty percent of parents said they had given up privacy since their adult children moved back home, while more than a quarter have taken on added debt, and seven percent have delayed retirement.

Joe Kanfer, the company's C. E. O., told me recently, \"there were a couple of other alcohol products out there, but they were really ugly. Either they were greasy   or they burned your hands white.\" Kanfer took a year and a half to develop this product which is visually appealing and does almost no harm to one's skin. Still. Kanfer lost money on it for more than a decade because people couldn't get what it was for. The product was called Purell. Today, you see it everywhere. My doctor uses it several times during every office visit. You can hear it in almost every office in the U. S. and school picnics would be impossible without it. The former president Grorge W.Bush was called a racist for using hand cleaner after first shaking hands with Barack Obama, but Bush also gave some of it to Obama and recommended it as a cold preventative  . What was once barely even a product is now a growing product category, worth hundreds of millions per year. The rise of Purell makes some health professionals uneasy. Some claimed that promoting hand cleaner may worsen \"our culture's irrational   fear about bacteria.\" Still, the clear agreement among experts is that unclean hands pose a serious health risk, and are one of the main reasons in the spread of infections in hospitals. A 2007 study estimated that, in America in 2002, such infections resulted in more than a million and a half patient illnesses and caused or contributed to nearly a hundred thousand patient deaths - about double the number of U. S. deaths currently caused each year by AIDS and guns combined. However, I asked a food microbiologist whether clean hands might have a medical drawback. He said, \"We might have a much healthier population if we adopted the kinds of condition that we see in many Third World countries, with poor-quality food and poor-quality water and lots of bacteria. If we did that, we would have adults who were very healthy and have very strong immune systems. Unfortunately, the price that we would pay would be extremely high child death rate. \" What can we learn about the people in Third World countries?", "subject": ""}

There is no past or present information of human beings who were not in groups. The groups may be small, like the family, or large, like a city or nation. But in order to reach complete development, man must be a member of a society. It is true that some individuals are more solitary than others. Some like monks or hermits may decide, for religious or other reasons, to leave their society and live alone. But these are unusual individuals, and even they cannot separate themselves completely from the rest of mankind. A society, then, seems to be the natural environment of mankind. Scholars who study mankind in social organizations are called social scientists.  The human behavior which social scientists study is learned behavior. The behavior of the human body as a living organism is studied by the biologist, the biochemist, or the physician. This behavior of man's physical body is inherited through the genetic development of his species. For example, all physically normal and healthy humans learn to walk as their bodies grow and develop. Social scientists concern themselves with the behavior that man must learn so that he can take his place in a social group. In order to be a functioning member of that group, each member must learn to behave in a way acceptable according to the differences among societies. The social scientists are newcomers to academic studies. By the end of the 19th century, the natural sciences had developed a method, by which they were able to understand the physical world. By using the scientific method, chemists, physicists, and astronauts, for example, learned a great deal about the universe. It seemed reasonable to apply the same method to the study of man's social life. Through this kind of study man may learn to understand himself much better.

{"answer": 3, "choices": ["Native Americans domesticated local wolves into dogs.", "Scientists discovered some ancient dog remains in 1920s.", "Latin America's dogs are different from North America's in genes.", "Ancient dogs entered North America across the Bering Land Bridge."], "question": "When people first walked across the Bering Land Bridge thousands of years ago, dogs were by their sides, according to a study published in the journal Science. Robert Wayne of the University of California, Los Angeles, and Jennifer Leonard of the Smithsonian Institute, used DNA material--some of it unearthed by miners in Alaska--to conclude that today's domestic dog originated in Asia and accompanied the first humans to the New World about 10,000 to 15,000 years ago. Wayne suggests that man's best friend may have enabled the tough journey from Asia into North America. \"Dogs may have been the reason people made it across the land bridge,\" said Wayne. \"They can pull things, carry things, defend you from fierce animals, and they're useful to eat.\" Researchers have agreed that today's dog is the result of the domestication  of wolves thousands of years ago. Before this recent study, a common thought about the precise origin of North America's domestic dog was that Natives domesticated local wolves, the descendents  of which now live with people in Alaska, Canada, and the Lower 48. Dog _ from a Fairbanks-area gold mine helped the scientists reach their conclusion. Leonard, an evolutionary biologist, collected DNA from 11 bones of ancient dogs that were locked in permafrost  until Fairbanks miners uncovered them in the 1920s. The miners donated the preserved bones to the American Museum of Natural History in New York City, where they remained untouched for more than 70 years. After borrowing the bones from the museum, Leonard and her colleagues used radiocarbon techniques to find the age of the Alaska dogs. They found the dogs all lived between the years of 1450 and 1675 A.D., before Vitus Bering and Aleksey Chirikov who were the first known Europeans to view Alaska in 1741. The bones of dogs that wandered the Fairbanks area centuries ago should therefore be the remains of \"pure native American dogs,\" Leonard said. The DNA of the Fairbanks dogs would also expose whether they were the descendents of wolves from North America. Along with the Fairbanks samples, the researchers collected DNA from bones of 37 dog specimens  from Mexico, Peru, and Bolivia that existed before the arrival of Columbus. In the case of both the Alaska dogs and the dogs from Latin America, the researchers found that they shared the most genetic material with gray wolves of Europe and Asia. This supports the idea of domestic dogs entering the New World with the first human explorers who wandered east over the land bridge. Leonard and Wayne's study suggests that dogs joined the first humans that made the adventure across the Bering Land Bridge to slowly populate the Americas. Wayne thinks the dogs that made the trip must have provided some excellent service to their human companions or they would not have been brought along. \"Dogs must have been useful because they were expensive to keep,\" Wayne said. \"They didn't feed on mice; they fed on meat, which was a very guarded resource.\" What can we know from the passage?", "subject": ""}

Nowadays in China, food waste is a widespread problem. Each year, Chinese people throw away the equivalent   of about 50 million tons of grain, an amount which could feed 200 million people, according to Xinhua News Agency.    One reason is that people are unaware of the issue.    \"Some of my friends don't care at all when they can't finish the food on their plates,\" said Zu, \"and they even throw it away if they don't like the taste.\"    Gong Tao, an official from the Communist Youth League of China Committee of Central South University in Hunan province, is worried about the decreasing awareness of food waste on his campus in recent years.    \"Students don't know how much hard work others go through in order to provide their food,\" Gao told China Education Daily.    One deeper factor is the Chinese cultural value of \"face\". In a Chinese banquet   setting, the host feels great shame when guests' plates are empty. \"Serving lots of food is the Chinese way of showing respect to guests and displaying generosity,\" Yu Changjiang, a sociologist at Peking University, told Xinhua.     Huge public spending on government banquets is also worsening the situation. Government banquets at the taxpayer's expense   have become \"a major source of waste\", commented People's Daily.    The good news is that people are already beginning to take action. On Jan 16, 10 restaurants with 749 outlets   in Beijing joined an \"eating up\" campaign promoted by Xu Xiake, deputy director of China Land and Resources News. These restaurants have begun serving half-sized meals and small dishes.    So, how can you help reduce food waste?

One reason is that people are unaware of the issue.    \"Some of my friends don't care at all when they can't finish the food on their plates,\" said Zu, \"and they even throw it away if they don't like the taste.\"    Gong Tao, an official from the Communist Youth League of China Committee of Central South University in Hunan province, is worried about the decreasing awareness of food waste on his campus in recent years.    \"Students don't know how much hard work others go through in order to provide their food,\" Gao told China Education Daily.    One deeper factor is the Chinese cultural value of \"face\". In a Chinese banquet   setting, the host feels great shame when guests' plates are empty. \"Serving lots of food is the Chinese way of showing respect to guests and displaying generosity,\" Yu Changjiang, a sociologist at Peking University, told Xinhua.     Huge public spending on government banquets is also worsening the situation. Government banquets at the taxpayer's expense   have become \"a major source of waste\", commented People's Daily.

On Jan 16, 10 restaurants with 749 outlets   in Beijing joined an \"eating up\" campaign promoted by Xu Xiake, deputy director of China Land and Resources News. These restaurants have begun serving half-sized meals and small dishes.    So, how can you help reduce food waste? Discuss with your family regularly about your food preferences and how much you want to eat. Eat all of the food on your plate and in your bowl. And each week, help your parents clean the fridge so that all of the food gets eaten before it goes to waste. The passage is meant to tell the readers   _  .", "subject": ""}

The British Potato Council wants the Oxford English Dictionary to replace the expression with the term \"couch slouch\", with protests being outside Parliament in London and the offices of Oxford University Press. Kathryn Race, head of marketing at the Council, which represents some 4,000 planters and processors, said the group had complained in writing to the OED but had yet to receive a response. \"We are trying to get rid of the image that potatoes are bad for you,\" she said on Monday. \"The potato has had its knocks in the past. Of course it is not the Oxford English Dictionary's fault but we want to use another term instead of \"couch potato\" because potatoes are naturally healthy.\" The OED says that \"couch potato\" began as American slang, meaning \"a person who spends his or her leisure time sitting around, especially watching television or video tapes.\" The Potato Council says its campaign is backed by dieticians   who say the vegetable is low in fat and high in vitamin C. Supporting the campaign, famous cook Antony Worrall Thompson said the vegetable was one of Britain's favorite foods. \"Not only are they healthy, they are also convenient and yummy  . Life without potato is like a sandwich without a filling,\" he said.

But little-used words can be removed from the smaller dictionaries to make way for newer ones. \"If society stops using words then they get taken out of the smaller dictionaries,\" he added. The first known recorded use of the expression \"couch potato\" was in an article in Los Angeles Times, in 1979, Simpson said.

This could be a co-worker, or relative. In this case, say what needs to be said as little as possible. Sometimes it feels good to let out your anger back to negative person, but all this is to lower you to that same negative level and they won't feel ashamed of themselves about that.

Recently, researchers found that dogs can look at our faces, and tell the difference between a smile and a frown . The animals were able to recognize a look of praise from one of blame. Researchers at the University of Veterinary Medicine, Vienna performed a series of experiments. They taught dogs to recognize facial expressions. They showed the dogs two pictures of either the upper or lower half of a person's face. On one picture, the person looked happy. The other appeared angry.

At least it was when I was growing up. It is widely believed that milk is a must in building strong bones and teeth. There's no doubt that dairy products, especially milk, are high in protein and calcium, and Vitamin D and Vitamin A are added to most milk products. While it's well known that our bones need calcium, some studies suggest that high calcium intake doesn't necessarily lower a person's risk for fractures . A Harvard study found that people who drank two or more glasses of milk had no greater protection from breaking a bone than those who drank a glass or less a week. There is no doubt that we need calcium. Some anti-dairy supporters claim dairy products can lead to heart disease. Much of this claim is based on high-fat dairy products, like cheese and cream, which may indeed lead to some health problems. Some studies have linked high milk intakes with a risk of prostate cancer; this seems also to be caused by high-fat dairy products, but not by dairy products in general. Although milk has always been regarded as the most important thing we need for our bones, one of the most important things in strengthening bones and reducing the risk of osteoporosis is weight-bearing exercise, such as jogging, walking, and weight lifting.

{"answer": 1, "choices": ["Sensitive.", "Adventurous.", "Strict.", "Generous."], "question": "For Canadians, backpacking Europe is a special ceremony signifying a new life stage. Unlike package tours, backpacking is a struggle, full of discovery and chance connections. It is about focusing on something different from our own lives and losing ourselves in a new world, if only for a moment. Well, that's what backpacking Europe is supposed to do. That's what it used to do before modern communications, social media, and commercial hostelling  . Older Canadians would not recognize the Europe that they backpacked in the 1960s, 1970s and even the 1980s. Far from a rough adventure into foreign cultures, the European experience has been _ in part by today's technology. A few years ago, I took my then 60-year-old father on a backpacking trip across part of Europe and Turkey. As he is an experienced traveler and someone who possesses a strong sense of adventure, I decided that we'd travel on a budget, staying in hostel dorms. For him, backpacking through Europe in 1969 was about independence and struggle. But two things surprised him at the end of our journey. First was how technology-based backpacking had become: Young people were so directly connected to home that they were hardly away in any meaningful sense.

Every day each year for about two weeks, I see those beautiful flowers. This spring, I started a wildflower garden in my yard. I can look out of the kitchen window while doing the dishes and see the flowers. I've often thought that those lovely blue flowers from the fields would look great in that bed alongside other wildflowers. Every day I drove past the flowers, thinking, \"I'll stop on my way home and dig them.\" \"Gee, I don't want to get my good clothes dirty...\" Whatever the reason, I never stopped to dig them. My husband even gave me a tool one year for that expressed purpose. One day on my way home from work, I was saddened to see that the highway department had cleared up the fields and the pretty blue flowers were gone. I thought to myself, \"Way to go, you waited too long. You should have done it when you first saw them blooming this spring. \" A week ago we were shocked and saddened to learn that my oldest sister-in-law has a cancer. She is 20 years older than my husband and unfortunately, because of age and distance, we haven't been as close as we all would have liked. I couldn't help but see the connection between the pretty blue flowers and the relationship between my husband's sister and us. I do believe that God has given us some time left to plant some wonderful memories that will bloom every year for us. And yes, if I see the blue flowers again, I'm sure I'll stop and transplant them to my wildflower garden. What does the writer want to tell us?", "subject": ""}
{"answer": 0, "choices": ["The Perfect Mistake.", "An Ordinary Carpenter.", "A Careless Old Man.", "A Pair of Glasses."], "question": "My grandfather worked as a carpenter. On this particular day, he was building some crates for the clothes his church was sending to an orphanage in Brazil. On his way home, he found his glasses were gone. When he mentally replayed his earlier actions, he realized what happened. The glasses had slipped out of his pocket and fallen into one of the crates. His new glasses were heading for Brazil! The Great Depression was at its height, and Grandpa had six children. He had spent twenty dollars for those glasses that very morning. \"It's not fair,\" he thought as he walked home angrily. \"I've been very faithful in giving my time and money to my work, and now this.\" Several months later, the director of the orphanage came to the United States. He wanted to visit all the churches that supported him, so he came to my grandfather's small church in Chicago. He began by thanking the people for their kindness in supporting the orphanage. \"But most of all,\" he said, \" I must thank you for the glasses you sent last year. You see, some people had just come to the orphanage, destroying everything, including my glasses. I was desperate. Even if I had the money, there was simply no way of replacing those glasses. Along with not being able to see well, I experienced headaches every day, so my coworkers and I were very worried about this. Then your crates arrived. When I removed the covers, I found a pair of glasses lying on top.\" He paused long enough to let his words sink in. Then, he continued: \"When I tried on the glasses, it was as though they had been made just for me!\" The people listened, happy for the miraculous glasses. But they thought it was strange because there were no glasses on their list of items to be sent overseas. Sitting quietly in the back, with tears streaming down his face, my grandfather, an ordinary carpenter realized his glasses had found a good place to go.

Chris Ward, author of the book Out of Office explains how President Barack Obama's first inauguration  speech was written by 27-year-old Jon Favreau sitting in Starbucks ; how Richard Tait, creator of Cranium, started the board game in a coffee shop; how Michael Acton Smith invented the children's virtual world Moshi Monsters in his local cafe Nero; and how JK Rowling, the novelist behind Harry Potter, believes a cafe is the best place to write. It is a convincing view, and for basic start-ups it makes much more sense to work from home and public spaces such as cafes than renting an expensive office. Offices are hard to find, costly to decorate and involve much tiring administration. Moreover, by staying independent you avoid the misery  of a daily commute , which for many is the worst part of a job. Thanks to mobile communications, WiFi  and cloud storage, together with the increasing heavy-duty equipment such as photocopiers, fax machines and desktop PCs, the traditional office is becoming redundant  for many sorts of organizations and workers.

First, it helps them preserve rare and fragile objects without refusing the demands of those who wish to study them. The British Library, for example, holds the only medieval manuscript of Beowulf in London. Only qualified scholars were allowed to see it until Kevin S. Kiernan of the University of Kentucky scanned the Manuscript with three different light sources and put the images up on the Internet for anyone to use. A second benefit is convenience.

Clerks are spared the chore of reshelving. And libraries could use the Internet to lend their collections to those who are unable to visit in person. The third advantage of electronic copies is that they occupy millimeters of space on a magnetic disk rather than meters on a shelf. The cost of library buildings is increasingly high.

Nowadays, we see parents deciding the schools for their little ones before the baby is even born. Once kids start going to school, some parents want to have a time-to-time update of their kid's activities. They want to come to the classroom every day, keep an eye on whom they talk to, know the friends they keep, start telling them how to do their job, and keep talking or giving a feedback to them about everything under the sun. Besides, they send their kids for extra hobby classes, as they want their children to do best in every field. When it comes to the education, super mom and dad have all the plans made for their children, and I am sure that they have come up with the best. So, try to fight for the dreams that your parents have set for you. However, in some cases, it may happen that the kids have some different dreams. Parents sometimes don't even consider the choices of their kids and may force them to do what they wanted to do in life. It's good to plan the future for the children, but leave at least some decisions to them. So what should the children do? First, hear out all the plans that your parents have made for you. If you have some different ideas, then sit down and talk to your family about it. Be patient and respect their decisions, but put your plan forth, and make them understand what you want to do and why. Many times, you are not aware of the difficulties that you may have to face while _ your dreams. Ask your parents for suggestions, which will make them feel good and involved. That way, they may support you if you are going on the right path. What is the author's attitude towards these super parents' behaviors?", "subject": ""}

The mice raised in equal periods of light and dark were split into three groups, one of which stayed on the 12hour schedule, one of which joined the winter group, and one of which joined the summer group.

Of course they never said anything, but if I got in an elevator. Everyone looked away because they didn't know what to say. But I didn't blame them.

He looked me right in the eye and said, \"So, are you on chemotherapy?\" I said, \"Yes, thank you for asking. You are the first person to actually acknowledge that fact.\" It felt so good to be talked to like a \"real\" person, without any pity, just the facts. I asked him what made him decide to say something, and he told me that a woman he worked with had just gone through the same thing several months before. I had some joke business cards that said my job title was \"Supreme Commander of the Universe\", so whenever this same UPS guy came to deliver a package, he would also say, \"Hey, Supreme Commander, how is it going?\" Then my company moved to a new location, and since that time I hadn't seen the UPS guy-Bryan- in probably two years. I went to answer my door at home one day, and there was Bryan with a package. Small world. \"Hey, Supreme Commander, long time no see!\" he said. He sees so many people all day long, every day, delivering packages but he remembered me after two years. What a great compliment!

The answer is, they're probably not. Traditional economics says that people are rational beings who will lie if it's to their advantage. A recent university study has shown that, actually, we're pretty honest  --especially when we're  at home. Researchers in Germany  phoned  people at home and asked them to toss  a coin. There was a strong  financial  incentive  to fake the result: if the coin landed tails-up, the participants  would receive money or a gift ticket, while if the coin landed heads-up, they would get nothing. Because they were  on the phone, they knew there was no risk of getting caught if they lied. And yet people told the truth.Over hundreds of tosses, a coin will land tails-up roughly 50% of the time. In this study 0ver half the people asked (55.6%) said that the coin landed heads-up, which meant they would receive nothing. Previous studies had found that people were more dishonest. In those laboratory studies, 75% of people reported a winning coin and claimed a reward. So the research team thinks it's being in our own homes which makes us play fair, although it's not yet clear why. In fact both types of study show people are surprisingly reliable. Even in the laboratory, 25% of people  turned down a reward by telling the truth. The researchers say this is because honesty is highly  valued in human society.We care about our  reputation and our sense of ourselves as respectable people.

It was developed by a group of scientists and engineers at Tokyo's Waseda University to help people suffering from snoring   and those who live with them. This is how the robotic pillow works: a microphone detects the noise level of the snoring, and if the snoring becomes very loud, which can be the sign of sleep apnea  , the bear will raise its hand and carefully touch the face of the sleeper, leading to a change in the sleeper's position without waking him or her up. This is definitely the world's first anti-snoring machine and an important potential treatment for sleep apnea. This sleeping disorder involves pauses in breathing, and can lead to heart attacks during sleep. In Japan, around 2 million people are struggling with the problem. When a sleeper starts snoring, the sleeper's blood oxygen level drops. The new device tracks   the level of oxygen in the sleeper's blood and wirelessly sends the information to the polar bear. But the only problem is that people not only have to sleep on a bear-shaped pillow with robotic hands, but also have to insert  their hands into a monitor that keeps track of blood oxygen levels.

Britain is one of them, for which the arrival of snow quite simply causes problems.

And almost within hours, there are also certain shortages----bread, vegetables and other things-----not because all these things can no longer be produced or sent to shops, but mainly because people are frightened and go out and store up with food and so on...just for fear that something bad should happen. But why does snow have this effect? After all, the Swiss, the Austrians and the Canadians don't have such problems. It is simple because there is not enough planning and preparation.

{"answer": 3, "choices": ["Sand", "Water", "A blanket.", "An extinguisher."], "question": "To extinguish   different kinds of fires, several types of fire extinguishers have been invented. They must be ready for immediate use when fire breaks out. Most portable   kinds operate for less than a minute, so they are useful only on small fires. The law requires  ships, trains, buses and planes to carry extinguishers. Since fuel, oxygen and heat must be present in order for fire to exist, one or more of these things must be removed or reduced to put out a fire. If the heat is reduced by cooling the material below a certain temperature, the fire goes out. The cooling method is the most common way to put out a fire. Water is the best cooling material because it is low in cost and easy to get. Another method of extinguishing fire is by cutting off the oxygen. This is usually done by covering the fire with sand, steam or some other things. A blanket may be used to cover a small fire. A third method is called separation, which includes removing the fuel, or material easy to burn from a fire, so that it can find no fuel. The method that is used to put out a fire depends on the type of fire. Fires have been grouped in three classes. Fires in wood, paper, cloth and the like are called Class A fires.

{"answer": 3, "choices": ["It develops by time", "It develops by space", "It develops by order", "It develops by examples"], "question": "Business people must keep records of the money they take in and the money they spend. The work of keeping such records is called book keeping. The work of deciding how the records should be set up is called accounting. An accountant also finds out, from the records, whether or not a business is doing well. Suppose a man owns a small clothing store. He keeps records that show that he spent money for newspaper advertising, and for suit, coats, shoes, and neckties to sell to his customers. He had to pay a young man to help him in the store. He also paid rent and had other expenses. At the end of the year. He must take an inventory. That is, he counts how many pieces of clothing he has on hand. Then he must find out exactly how many he sold, how much money he spent in running the business. If he took in more than he spent, he made a profit  for the year. If he spent more than he took in he suffered a loss. The owner of a small clothing store can keep accounting records without much trouble. But a giant  oil company or a big bank has many difficult accounting problems. The company must know how much money is to be paid by its debtors   and how much it owns other companies for supplies. It must know how much the company's buildings and machines are worth, and how much the company has lost in depreciation , or wear and tear, of its equipment. All of this information must be kept in the company's accounts. Big companies employ many accountants. In which following way does the passage develop?", "subject": ""}

I went to the show's website to see for myself. My mom was right. At a time when even Barbara Walters says she's really bored with celebrities interviews, this one will not disappoint. It's the story of Derek Paravicini, a 30-year-old who was born three months early, physically disabled (he can't button his own shirt), blind, and severely autistic . Yet, through total luck and coincidence, his family discovered that Derek had a remarkable musical talent when he was three. Derek can hear any musical composition one time and play it perfectly on the piano. That's right. He only has to hear it once. Even more unbelievable, his brain, like a computer, can keep many songs that he can immediately repeat when asked. But his talent isn't limited to just learning things by heart. Derek is a true musical genius and artist who plays beautifully in a wide range of styles and can make his own music. With his talent, Derek has raised millions of dollars putting on charity concerts. He also donates his time to senior centers where he acts as a human jukebox   machine, taking requests from senior citizens who haven't heard their favorite songs for decades. As it turns out, Derek loves people and his extraordinary talent has been the key to unlocking his personality and social development. If you want to inspire your family, pop some popcorn and sit everyone down to watch this excellent piece of journalism. If your kids are like mine, it will cause a great family discussion about the definition of \"disability\" and the extraordinary ability of the human brain and spirit.

When you are pressed for time on a business trip, nothing can _ you more than a slow hotel check-in process. On your next trip, try these hotels that offer a speedier check-in process. 1. Yotel New York The self-service kiosks at this high-tech New York hotel work just like the ones you'd see at an airport. There are just five-steps to register and obtain your card key. There is even a robotic luggage bellboy. You tap in the number of bags you are carrying and sizes, then wait for a robot arm to swing down and store your luggage in a locker (say, for a day trip). This also speeds up the check-in process if the first thing you need to do, like me, is head to a series of meetings. 2. Marriott Detroit Airport Another option for business travelers in a hurry: Marriott is rolling out its mobile check-in app to 325 hotels this year, including the Marriott Detroit Airport hotel. (I've tested the app itself but not for a real visit quite yet.) Here is the basic idea: you download the iphone or Android app. The night before, you can \"check-in\" virtually. When you arrive, you get an alert that the room is ready and your key, which is already tied to your reservation, is waiting for you at the desk. 3. Hyatt Regency Minneapolis I happened to stay at this hotel recently and liked how fast the kiosk check-in works. Like the Yotel, the kiosk asks you to insert your credit card, similar to an airport terminal. The whole process took about three minutes, when I left, I was equally impressed with the fast check-out. An agent meets you in the lobby with an ipad and asks for an email to use for a receipt. The big advantage: you never have to wait in line. 4. Radisson: LaCrosse The Radisson is trying to make the kiosk process even faster, at a few select hotels like the Radisson Lacrosse in Wisconsin, you use a mobile app to register and then receive a barcode by email or text. When you get the kiosk, you scan the barcode to get your key without any other steps required. It's super fast.

{"answer": 2, "choices": ["It has caused a panic in many countries.", "It is the most dangerous virus in the world.", "A strong health system is important to fight against Ebola.", "Anyone who was infected Ebola will die."], "question": "2014 saw that the Ebola virus reappeared in Guinea and soon spread into neighbouring Liberia and Sierra Leone, killing over 7,800 people by the new year of 2015. It leads to viral hemorrhagic fever, which is characterized by high fever and internal bleeding etc. Ebola is named after the Ebola River, where it was first discovered in 1976. There are five different types of the Ebola virus, each named after where they first happened: Sudan, Ivory Coast, Reston, Bundibugyo, and Zaire. The deadliest of the five, Zaire, was responsible for the 2012 out- break, and is believed to be attacking Guinea. Ebola is naturally found in fruit bats, which pass on the virus to other animals by biting or sucking on their blood. Humans who are suffering from the Ebola infection might have touched the bodily fluids of the infected animals. Once infected, a human becomes a carrier of the deadly virus. Unfortunately, there are no disease - specific treatments for Ebola. Health - care workers only supply the infected people with physiological saline to keep them in good condition. Ebola can kill 90% of those infected, especially in underdeveloped societies like those in Africa.

It leads to viral hemorrhagic fever, which is characterized by high fever and internal bleeding etc. Ebola is named after the Ebola River, where it was first discovered in 1976. There are five different types of the Ebola virus, each named after where they first happened: Sudan, Ivory Coast, Reston, Bundibugyo, and Zaire. The deadliest of the five, Zaire, was responsible for the 2012 out- break, and is believed to be attacking Guinea. Ebola is naturally found in fruit bats, which pass on the virus to other animals by biting or sucking on their blood. Humans who are suffering from the Ebola infection might have touched the bodily fluids of the infected animals. Once infected, a human becomes a carrier of the deadly virus.

There are three kinds of flu virus, known as A, B and C. flu C virus is  ly stable and causes mild infections that do not spread far through the population. The A and B types are unstable, and are responsible for the epidemics that cause frequent concern. Following any virus attack, the human body builds up antibodies   which can be changed into immunity to that type of virus but a virus with the ability to change its character is able to bypass this protection. Variability  is less developed in the flu B virus, which affects only human beings. As flu B virus may cause a widespread epidemic but will have little effect if introduced into the same community soon afterwards, since nearly everyone will have built up antibodies and will be immune. The flu A virus, which affects animals also, is extremely unstable and is responsible for some of the worst outbreaks of the disease, such as the world epidemic, of 1918&1919, when about half the world's population were infected and about twenty million people died, some from pneumonia caused by the virus itself and some from secondary complication caused by bacteria. Accurate prediction is difficult because of the complication of the factors. A particular virus may be related to one to which some of the population have partial involved immunity.

It is believed that he sought solace from his imprisonment by writing love poems to his wife.     Valentine's Day is now celebrated in many countries around the world. However, the traditions often differ from place to place. In Japan, for example, it is customary for the woman to send chocolates to the man, while in Korea April 14th is known as 'Black Day' when the unfortunate men who have received nothing on Valentine's Day gather to eat noodles and comfort each other.     Technological developments have also played their part in keeping Valentine's Day relevant to the 21st century. Valentine's e-cards have been all the rage   in recent years.      Valentine's cards can also be used for less than romantic purposes. This year police in Liverpool sent Valentine's cards to criminals who failed to appear in court or have not paid fines. The cards contained the verse:       \"Roses are red; violets are blue. You've got a warrant and we'd love to see you.\"     Who says romance is dead?

As graduation day approached, excitement increased. Being out of high school meant I was finally coming of age. Soon I would be on my own, making my own decisions, doing what I wanted without someone looking over my shoulder and it meant going to school with boys--a welcome change coming from an all-girl high school. There was never any question in my mind that I would go to a college away from home. My mother's idea, on the other hand, was just the opposite. Trying her best not to force her preferences on me, she would subtly ask whether I had considered particular schools--all of which happened to be located in or near my hometown of Chicago. Once it was established that, as long as the expenses would not be too heavy a burden on the family budget, I would be going away anyway, my family's perspective changed. Their concern shifted from whether I was going away to how far. The schools I was considering on the East Coast suddenly looked much more attractive than those in California.

Trying her best not to force her preferences on me, she would subtly ask whether I had considered particular schools--all of which happened to be located in or near my hometown of Chicago. Once it was established that, as long as the expenses would not be too heavy a burden on the family budget, I would be going away anyway, my family's perspective changed. Their concern shifted from whether I was going away to how far. The schools I was considering on the East Coast suddenly looked much more attractive than those in California. But which college I would attend was just one of what seemed like a never-ending list of unknowns: What would college be like? Would I be unbearably lonely not knowing anyone else who was going to the same school? Would the other students like me? Would I make friends easily? Would I miss my family so much that I wouldn't be able to stand it? And what about the work--would I be able to keep up? (Being an A student in high school seemed to offer little assurance I would be able to survive college.) What if the college I selected turned out to be a horrible mistake? Would I be able to transfer to another school? Then panic set in. My feelings took a 180-degree turn. I really didn't want to leave high school at all, and it was questionable whether I wanted to grow up after all. It had been nice being respected as a senior by the underclass students for the past year; I didn't enjoy the idea of being on the bottom rung of the ladder again. Despite months of expectation, nothing could have prepared me for the impact of the actual day. As the familiar melody of \"Pomp and Circumstance\" echoed in the background, I looked around at the other figures in white caps and gowns as we seriously lined into the hall. Tears welled up uncontrollably in my eyes, and I was consumed by a rush of sadness. As if in a daze , I rose from my seat when I heard my name called and slowly crossed the stage to receive my diploma. As I reached out my hand, I knew that I was reaching not just for a piece of paper but for a brand-new life. Exciting as the future of a new life seemed, it wasn't easy saying good-bye to the old one--the familiar faces, the familiar routine. I would even miss that chemistry class I wasn't particularly fond of and the long travel each day between home and school that I hated. Good or bad, it was what I knew. That September, I was fortunate to attend a wonderful university in Providence, Rhode Island. I needn't have worried about liking it. My years there turned out to be some of the best years of my life. And as for friends, some of the friendships I formed there I still treasure today. Years later, financial difficulties forced my high school to close its doors for good. Although going back is impossible, it's comforting to know I can revisit my special memories any time.

He said tired workers can spray a 'shot' of caffeine onto their skin without experiencing a strong buzz, loading up on unnecessary calories or being stuck with a nasty aftertaste like they might get from drinking energy drinks or coffee. The patent-pending caffeine spray is an odourless liquid that is absorbed through the skin and distributed through the body over a number of hours to deliver a caffeine hit that apparently lasts longer than guzzling a cup of coffee. Each small aluminum bottle of Sprayable Energy contains around 160 sprays - the equivalent amount of caffeine to 40 cups of coffee and the creators say it is a much cheaper way of getting a caffeine fix than popping to a cafe. The only active ingredient in the spray is caffeine, which can naturally enter the human body through the skin by passing through cell membranes as it is very similar to nicotine in structure. Each spritz of Sprayable Energy contains around a quarter of the amount of caffeine found in a cup of coffee, but apparently has the same effect as a full cup. The website said: 'The reason for this is our product not being ingested, isn't almost entirely metabolised  by the liver before entering your system and becoming available to your body.''Thus, a smaller amount of caffeine can have just the same effect as a very large amount of caffeine ingested through an energy drink or cup of coffee.

Since those early days, many people have been involved in the process of developing a machine that could do the same thing more quickly and with greater efficiency. Charles Wiesenthal, who was born in Germany, designed and received a patent on a double-pointed needle that eliminated the need to turn the needle around with each stitch   in England in 1755. Other inventors of that time tried to develop a functional sewing machine, but each design had at least one serious imperfection. Frenchman Barthelemy Thimonnier finally engineered a machine that really worked. However, he was nearly killed by a group of angry tailors when they burned down his garment factory. They feared that they would lose their jobs to the machine. American inventor Elias Howe, born on July 9, 1819, was awarded a patent for a method of sewing that used thread from two different sources. Howe's machine had a needle with an eye at the point, and it used the two threads to make a special stitch called a lockstitch. However, Howe faced difficulty in finding buyers for his machines in America. In frustration, he traveled to England to try to sell his invention there. When he finally returned home, he found that dozens of manufacturers were adapting his discovery for use in their own sewing machines.

You might be able to blame your genes, a new study in the journal Neuroscience Letters suggests. Researchers from the University of Bonn have identified a variant  on the DRD2 gene that seems to be associated with increased forgetfulness. Everyone has one of two variants of the DRD2 gene, the difference is just one letter in the genetic code: Some people have the cytosine (C) variant, while others have the thymine (T) variant. The researchers wanted to see how having one variant over another was associated with forgetfulness. To test this, they analyzed the DRD2 gene of 500 study participants, and also had the participants answer surveys about their forgetfulness (such as how often they misplaced their keys, or forgot names). Most of the study participants--three quarters of them--had the thymine gene variant, while the other quarter had the cytosine gene variant. Researchers found an association between more forgetfulness problems and having the thymine gene variant of DRD2. Meanwhile, the cytosine gene variant seemed to have a protective effect against forgetfulness. However, \"there are things you can do to compensate for forgetfulness; writing yourself notes or making more of an effort to put your keys down in a specific location--and not just anywhere,\" study researcher Dr. Sebastian Markett, of the University of Bonn, said in a statement. Research has also suggested that some age groups are more forgetful than others. A recent national poll showed that millenials, who were born between the early 1980s and the early 2000s, are actually more likely than seniors to be absent-minded with things like what day of the week it is, where they put their keys and remembering to bring their lunch.

These changes are taking place due to the campaign against childhood fatness, for which the first lady Michelle Obama began fighting three years ago.  Fatness has become a serious problem in the country. About one-third of U.S. children are overweight, which puts them at increased risk for any number of deadly illnesses, including high blood pressure and heart disease.  Still, Mrs. Obama faces challenge. Not everyone welcomes her effort. Some blame her for going too far and say she has no right to tell what people should and shouldn't eat. But nutrition supporters and others praise her for using her influence to help bring interests to the table. They said the first lady has raised public awareness about fatness, which will help decrease childhood fatness rates. There is evidence of small decrease in childhood fatness rates in some parts of the country. New York reported a 5.5 percent drop in fatness rates in kindergarteners through eighth-graders between the 2006-07 and 2010-11 school years.

Or have you ever wanted to bring a puppet   to life? If so, you may be interested in learning the art of ventriloquism  . A ventriloquist can make an ordinary object seem to be alive by giving it a personality, movement, and speech. Your object can be a puppet, or a doll. Give your new \"friend\" a name, and then decide on the personality that he will have. The next step is to give your friend movements that agree with the personality you have chosen. Now you can learn to make your \"friend\" talk. A ventriloquist will control his mouth and lips so that it will appear that his voice is coming from the object he is using. This will take practice, but you can do it. First, decide on a voice that is different from your own. It could be higher or lower than yours, or could even have a special accent. Then, find a clean teaspoon and hold the handle between your front teeth. Now, using the voice you created for your friend and holding the handle of the teaspoon tightly between your teeth, look into a mirror and talk. Practicing with the spoon in your mouth will help you learn to keep your mouth from moving. Now try telling a joke in your normal voice and have your friend speak in his voice. Practice those words until you can say them without your lips moving at all. Ventriloquism is fun. It also requires hard work to become good at it. The most important thing to do is practice.

She can remember all the events she has experienced in her life. The events are so vivid, as if they happened just moments ago. But her vivid memories often become a reality. Rebecca said, \"When I relive memories, the emotions come back. So if it's something that happened when I was younger, my emotions are about what I felt then. I also re-experience pain. For example, I remember falling over and hurting my left knee when I was three. When talking about it now, I'm getting pain in my left knee.\" However, there are times when Rebecca's memories prove to be too overwhelming, and she has learnt relaxation and mindfulness  techniques to solve. \"At school, it is a _ . I'm not very quick at processing things, so there is always so much going through my mind. At night, I have to sleep with the radio on and a soft light. If it's too dark or quiet, my mind just recalls all these memories and I can't sleep,\" Rebecca said. In addition, Rebecca has no control over whether the memories she recalls will be positive or negative - recalling painful experiences with such vividness that she has suffered from post-traumatic   stress disorder. Rebecca said, \"Recently, I went back to my old school for my sister's high school graduation. Being in that building again brought all those memories flooding back. I burst into tears and had to leave.\" Rebecca and her mother Mrs. Barnes got in touch with the University of California in 2011. It was there that Rebecca knew she had Highly Superior Autobiographical Memory (HSAM). It's reported that Rebecca is one of just 80 people worldwide, who have HASM. \"Finding out about HASM has been such a positive experience. Now, Rebecca has been more positive and able to do things independently, which has been excellent,\" Mrs. Barnes said. What's wrong with Rebecca?", "subject": ""}

The way to create a healthy balance between giving and receiving is to know and then live by your values .I break values up into two groups which I call being and having values. Your being values are the character traits of the ideal person you would like to be. I suggest to my clients that they choose three being values that they are willing to make a commitment to live by. An example of some being values are: kind, loving, generous, inspirational, peaceful, wise and even powerful. By acting on these values you give to others through your actions and you inspire others by being a positive role model. Mastering being these character traits becomes your life purpose. Your having values are the feelings you need to create in order to be happy. These could be companionship, achievement, support, being valued or financial security. This is what you receive. You take responsibility for filling your own needs by taking steps to create these feelings and conditions in your life. When you make a commitment to live by your being values, it becomes easier to make conscious choices rather than reactionary ones. If your usual pattern is to talk about your problems, you could choose to think and act like a calm person. A calm person might go for a walk, meditate, or set a time limit before responding. If your usual pattern is to worry, you could choose to act like a responsible or wise person. In other words, you would act like the person you choose to be--this is the key to personal power.

He got the idea from the way the potatoes were planted in the field. The potatoes grew in long lines, side by side. This made a shape in Philo's mind. This shape helped Philo think of a way to send the TV picture onto a piece of glass. But he was poor, so Philo could not try to make his idea into a machine at that time. Later, Philo worked at many different jobs. He worked with trees. He worked on broken radios. He worked on trains. He also worked as a street cleaner. At last, two rich men heard about his idea for television, and they gave him the money to make it. On September 7th, 1927, they watched Philo test the machine he built.

As a boy, he loved to learn about science, and he read a lot of science books. When he was only thirteen years old, he drew a picture of a machine that could send pictures as radio sends sounds. He got the idea from the way the potatoes were planted in the field. The potatoes grew in long lines, side by side. This made a shape in Philo's mind. This shape helped Philo think of a way to send the TV picture onto a piece of glass. But he was poor, so Philo could not try to make his idea into a machine at that time. Later, Philo worked at many different jobs. He worked with trees. He worked on broken radios. He worked on trains. He also worked as a street cleaner. At last, two rich men heard about his idea for television, and they gave him the money to make it. On September 7th, 1927, they watched Philo test the machine he built. When Philo turned on the machine, a small line could be seen on the glass. Philo said, \"There you have it, electric television.\" Later, a big company, RCA, said they had made the first television. Philo had to spend a lot of money on lawyers to fight them. Finally, he won. Then, World War Two started in 1939. During the war, Philo spent a lot of money helping the US army instead of _ his television company. After the war, other bigger, richer companies started making televisions.

After many tiring book-signing tours from city to city, Atwood thought there must be a better way to do them. She hired some technical experts and started her own company in 2004. Together they designed the LongPen. Here's how it works: The author writes a personal message and signature on a computer tablet  using a special pen. On the receiving end, in another city, a robotic arm fitted with a regular pen signs the book. The author and fan can talk with each other via webcams  and computer screens. Work on the LongPen began in Atwood's basement . At first, they had no idea it would be as hard as it turned out to be. The device went through several versions, including one that actually had smoke coming out of it. The investing finally completed, test runs were made in Ottawa, and the LongPen was officially launched at the 2006 London Book Fair. From here , Atwood conducted two transatlantic book signings of her latest book for fans in Toronto and New York City. The LongPen produces a unique signature each time because it copies the movement of the author in real time. It has several other potential applications. It could increase credit card security and allow people to sign contracts from another province. The video exchange between signer and receiver can be recorded on DVD for proof when legal documents are used. \"It's really fun\", said the owner of a bookstore, who was present for one of the test runs. \"Obviously you can't shake hands with the author, but there are chances for a connection that you don't get from a regular book signing.\" The response to the invention has not been all favorable.

The apps offer a cheap alternative to traditional texts. Using wireless internet connections, people can send a number of messages to their friends at a very low cost. Unlike traditional mobile texts, the users usually only have to pay to download the app once, after which each message they send is free. Instant messaging apps have become popular all over the world. Hundreds of millions of people use the apps to chat with their friends. These apps allow people to send pictures messages for free---something which previously was quite costly. Many of these apps also allow users to have access to a huge range of colourful emotions, which can help people express their emotions. The research company Informa said that almost 19 billion messages were sent per day using chat apps last year, compared with 17.6 billion SMS texts.

But she says that is because many people believe the drones would only deliver the products to the front door of a house. \"However, it is possible that homes will one day have special area on their roofs designed to receive product deliveries,\" she adds.

Returning to the scene of the crime is the same shame-causing punishment I received when I was five and stole something from a store. 1 remember my dad sending me back to return the item. It remains one of my clearest child- hood memories. After that day, I never stole again. My dad taught me such an important lesson 30 years ago and I saw an opportunity to do the same for my son. But now I wonder if it was the fight thing to do. \"Returning to the store is absolutely the right thing to do,\" Laura Markham, Ph.D., a child psychologist and author of Peaceful Parent, Happy Kids, says. \"Many children steal -- they' re not born knowing the rules so it' s our job to teach them.\" And stay calm when you set them. \"If you overreact or yell, you might create a fascination with the behavior and a willful child will be more likely to fight against you,\" she  says. Having a child physically return the stolen item helps him or her grasp the situation -- and the consequence. But don't talk about it for too long. \"lf you continuously bring up the incident, the child will believe they' re a thief and that they' re bad,\" she says. Only time will tell if this experience will have the same powerful effect on my son as it had on me, but at the same time I can rest if I haven' t dealt with the situation badly. What does the author think of Laura Markham' s words?", "subject": ""}

His classic tale of a poor orphan boy strikes at the heart of all those who have ever wanted \"more\", as Oliver did. And now, Dickens' classic scenes of the lives of the Victorian British poor will appear in a big screen movie, \"Oliver Twist,\" an adaptation of his classic tale directed by Roman Polanski. The new film is not meant for younger viewers, and is meant for children over 13. For those old enough to enjoy it, however, the film shows just how long people have been enjoying Dickens' remarkable literature. His short stories and essays began appearing in magazines in 1833. \"Oliver Twist\" was published in 1837 - more than 165 years ago. \"Oliver Twist\" tells the story of an orphan forced to live in a workhouse headed by the awful Mr Bumble, who cheats the boys who work there out of their already low pay. Oliver decides to escape to the streets of London, where he meets a thief called Fagin, played by Sir Ben Kingsley, who leads him into a world of crime. Several of Dickens' books have been made into films and television series, including 2002's \"Nicholas Nickleby\" and 2000's \"David Copperfield.\" And several versions of \"A Christmas Carol\" have entertained audiences for years. In his novels, Dickens wrote about several important issues. He talked about the Poor Law Amendment Act of 1824 in \"Oliver Twist\"; the French Revolution in \"A Tale of Two Cities\"; and helping the poor in \"Hard Times.\" One of Dickens' best-known books is the first Christmas book he wrote - \"A Christmas Carol\" (1843), about a mean man.

{"answer": 3, "choices": ["18.", "28.", "49.", "52."], "question": "Of all the famous English writers, probably the best known is William Shakespeare. He was born in Stratford-upon-Avon in 1564 on April the 23rd. His father was an important man in town so Shakespeare had a good upbringing. Shakespeare probably went to school (although no records survive to prove this) but not university. He got married when he was 18 to Anne Hathaway and the couple had 3 children. Shakespeare wrote 38 plays and 154 sonnets (a sonnet is a kind of poem). He began working in his home town of Stratford but by 1592 was writing in London. He became rich enough to buy a house in the capital and one in Stratford.  He wrote sad stories called tragedies, like Romeo and Juliet, funny stories or comedies, romantic stories and stories about historical figures such as Julius Caesar.  Shakespeare died on his birthday in 1616, almost 400 years ago. But why is his work still popular today? His work looked at common human themes, such as betrayal, murder, lust, power, ambition and love. These themes are as much a part of human nature today as they were all those years ago and are the themes we see in modern soap operas and Hollywood films. Even though his theatre, The Globe, burned down in 1613 it was rebuilt in London in 1997 and you can still see his plays performed there today. Shakespeare's influence on the English language can still be felt today. We talk about \"fair play\", meaning honest behaviour but this phrase was first used by Shakespeare. He coined the phrase \"you can have too much of a good thing\". And it was Shakespeare who came up with the expression to disappear \"into thin air\" which we still use today when we lose something. Shakespeare's work has been translated into every major language in the world. And perhaps we'll still be as fascinated by his work 400 years from now as we've been for the last 400.

It's good to make mistakes. That's not a  _ , folks,and I have not lost my mind. It is good to make mistakes, and here's why. First of all, mistakes are a clear sign that you are trying new things. It's always good to try new things because when you are trying new things you are growing. If you never try anything new, how can you improve? How can you expand? How can you innovate? The simple answer is, \"You can't.\" Look around you. With very few exceptions, either everything you see in your physical world or every single detail of every single thing is the result of someone trying something new. Another good thing about mistakes is this: when you are making mistakes, you are learning. Consider this: Edison failed 10,000 times before he perfected the light bulb. When asked how he felt to fail that many times, he remarked that he hadn't failed 10,000 times, but rather had learned 10,000 things that didn't work. Finally, when you make a mistake you are that much closer to success. Why? Because when all is said and done, you will have tried some finite number of things before you succeeded. Every time you made a mistake you eliminated one of those things and are one step closer. But this all doesn't mean that you should forge ahead with disregard for the consequences of a mistake.  Quite the contrary, when you try something new you have to be willing to set some reasonable limits so that, in the event that it doesn't work out the way you want it to, you will be in a position to try again. We all have limited resources in the form of time and money, so don't blow them all on one approach to a problem. Realize that it probably won't be perfect the first time and allocate these resources appropriately so you can learn, modify, and try it again.

Fifty cubic kilometers of magma   flew from its peak   and a blanket of ash as thick as one centimeter fell over more than 500,000 square kilometers of Indonesia and the Java Sea. The eruption destroyed Tambora's peak and formed a hole six by seven kilometers wide. The eruption and resulting tsunamis killed 10,000 people. The agricultural loss and disease brought about by the thick ash caused the deaths of 82,000 more. Indonesia was rocked again in 1883. On August 26, a small volcano on an uninhabited island between Sumatra and Java, erupted. The eruption produced an ash cloud 80 kilometers high and was heard in Australia--4,800 kilometers away. The eruption also caused a tsunami, which pounded   the shores of Java and Sumatra--killing 36,000 people. In 1902, St. Pierre was a thriving   community and the largest town on the French colony of Martinique in the Caribbean Sea. Mont Pelee cast a shadow over the town from where it stood, eight kilometers to the north.

The study suggests that there is a special part of our brain called the orbitofrontal cortex  , which plays an important part in making choices about what we eat. It is used for identifying the taste of food, especially when skipping breakfast. It is more likely to target high-calorie foods when you're on an empty stomach. Scientists did an experiment on this.

Katherine Ilachinski, who had been knocked off her chair by the blast of heat exploding from the neighboring tower, was one of those. Despite her 70 years of age, Ms Ilachinski, an architect working on the 91st floor of Tower 2 at World Trade Center, the south tower, went for the stairs. Twelve floors above her, Judy Wein, a manager, screamed and set off too. But others up and down the 110 floors, many without clear views of the damage across the way and thus unclear about what was happening, were not so sure. And the 18 minutes before the next plane would hit were ticking off. Among the uncertainty about what was the best thing to do, formal announcements inside the south tower instructed people to _ , assuring them that the building was sound and the threat was limited to the other tower. Some left, others stayed, some began to climb down and, when met with more announcements and other warning to stop or return, went back up. The decisions made in those instants proved to be of great importance, because many who chose to stay, were doomed   when the second jet crashed into the south tower killing many and stranding (...) many more in the floors above where the jet hit.

The research by Angelina Grigoryeva, a sociologist at Princeton University, found that, while women provide as much care for their elderly parents as they can manage, men do as little as they can get away with and often leave it to female family members. Her analysis of the family networks of 26,000 older Americans concluded that gender  is the most important predictor  of whether or not people will actively care for elderly parents. In a paper being presented at the annual conference of the American Sociological Association in San Francisco, she concludes that simply having a sister makes men statistically likely provide less care. Using data from the University of Michigan Health and Retirement Study, a study which has been tracking a cross-section of over-50s for the last decade, she calculated that women provide an average of 12.3 hours a month of care for elderly parents while men offer only 5.6 hours. \"Whereas the amount of elderly parent care daughters provide is associated with limitations they face, such as employment or childcare, sons'caregiving is associated only with the presence or absence of other helpers, such as sisters or a parent's spouse ,\" she explained. \"Sons reduce their relative caregiving efforts when they have a sister, while daughters increase theirs when they have a brother.\" \"This suggests that sons pass on parent caregiving responsibilities to their sisters.\" In the UK, the 2011 census  showed that there are now around 6.5 million people with caring responsibilities - a figure which has risen by a tenth in a decade.

In addition to providing information about birth control, a secondary education teaches women to reduce their own fertility  , improve the health of their children and allows them to move from a mindset of having many children, in the hopes that some will survive to improving the quality of each child's life, Cohen wrote in the journal Nature.

The 16yearold had already been married for a year. \"She looked at me with the saddest eyes and said, 'I had to drop out of school',\" Robinson said in a telephone interview. \"That conveyed to me the reality,\" said Robinson, the first woman to serve as Ireland's president and former U.N. high commissioner for human fights. \"Her life, as far as she is concerned, had more or less ended.\" Robinson said keeping girls in school was one of the most important things policymakers could do to address the coming challenges of an ever-increasing population, predicted by the United Nations to reach 7 billion soon. \"European countries are concerned about aging populations as is Japan, but this is much less of an issue than the huge number of people which we are going to see over the next 40 years when the population goes from 7 billion to 9 billion,\" she said. \"Almost all of that increase will be in poor developing countries, so that we have a very big challenge.\" Family planning experts worry in particular about the future population explosion in subSaharan Africa. In May, the United Nations projected the world population would reach 9.3billion in 2050 and 10.1 billion by 2100. Much of that growth will come from Africa, where the population is growing at 2.3 percent a year--more than double Asia's 1 percent growth rate. If that rate stays consistent, which is not certain, Africa's population will reach 3.6 billion by 2100 from the present 1 billion.

{"answer": 0, "choices": ["Natural killer cells are much more in the bloodstreams of runners than in the sedentary mice.", "Levels of interleukin-6 are higher in the blood of the runners than in the sedentary mice.", "Exercise such as running seemed to help the mice fight against the cancer.", "Adrenaline can reduce the severity of cancer or fight it off."], "question": "The relationship between exercise and cancer has long both intrigued and puzzled oncologists and exercise physiologists. Exercise is strongly associated with lowered risks for many types of cancer. At the same time, exercise involves biological stress, which typically leads to a short-term increase in inflammation  which can contribute to higher risks for many cancers. Now, a new study in mice may offer some clues into the exercise-cancer paradox. It suggests that exercise may change how the immune system deals with cancer by boosting adrenaline , certain immune cells and other chemicals that, together, can reduce the severity of cancer or fight it off altogether. To try to better understand how exercise can both elevate inflammation and simultaneously protect the body against cancer, scientists at the University of Copenhagen in Denmark and other institutions decided to closely examine what happens inside mice at high risk for the disease. So, for the new study, they began by gathering a group of adult lab mice. These animals generally like to run. The scientists then implanted melanoma   skin cancer cells into the mice before providing half of them with running wheels in their cages while the other animals remained sedentary. After four weeks, far fewer of the runners had developed full-blown melanoma than the sedentary mice and those that had been diagnosed with the disease showed fewer and smaller lesions. They drew blood from both the exercising and sedentary animals and cells from any tumors in both groups. As expected, they found much higher levels of the hormone adrenaline in the blood of the exercising animals, especially right after they had been working out on the wheels but also at other times of the day. The body releases adrenaline in response to almost any type of stressful experience, including exercise. They also found higher levels of interleukin-6 in the blood of the runners. This is a substance that is released by working muscles and is believed to both increase and decrease inflammation in the body, depending on where and how it goes to work. Perhaps most important, they found much higher numbers in the bloodstreams of runners than in the sedentary mice of a type of immune cell named natural killer cells that are known to be strong cancer fighters. So the scientists repeated their original experiment multiple times, inducing cancer while allowing some mice to run and others to sit. In some of these follow-up experiments, the scientists injected the runners with a substance that blocked the production of adrenaline and gave sedentary animals large doses of added adrenaline. What they now found was that when running mice could not produce adrenaline, they developed cancer at the same rate as the sedentary animals, while the sedentary animals that had been injected with extra adrenaline fought off their tumors better than other sitting mice. More remarkably, the scientists determined that adrenaline seemed to be sending biochemical signals to some of the animals' IL-6 cells, making them physiologically more alert, so that when a tumor began to develop in the affected animal, those IL-6 cells in turn activated the natural killer cells in the bloodstream and actually directed them to the tumors, like minute guide fish. With these results, \"we show that voluntary wheel running in mice can reduce the growth of tumors, and we have identified an exercise-dependent mobilization of natural killer cells as the underlying cause of this protection,\" said Pernille Hojman, a researcher at the University of Copenhagen who oversaw the new study.

I was sitting at a fruit stand beside Beihai Lake looking at the shinning ripple , which awoke me to a full sense of life. A mother and her daughter were sitting opposite to me. The latter, a lovely girl of seven or eight with a pretty, small nose, was occupied with an ice cream. Her mother, holding the child's sweater, was whispering to her. A sudden breeze blew and the child sneezed. Her mother rapidly put the sweater on her and began to button it up. In her hurry the buttons were wrongly matched, which was unnoticed by her until several had been done. The mother at once unbuttoned the sweater and did it again. Such an unimportant incident, however, did not escape the child's eye. \"Ha-ha, mum, see how your mind has wandered!\" said the girl with a loud laughter, which brought a bit angry look to the mother's face. As an onlooker, I imagined a good dressing down for the little girl because of the impolite remark she made. But instead there was only an embarrassing interval of a few seconds. Then I heard the mother's gentle voice: \"Yes, it surely has, for my heart has gone out to you!\" said the mother, pointing a kind finger at the girl's little chest. The child blinked  puzzlingly, hiding her red face in the arms of her mother who hugged her gently. A smile of satisfaction spread over the mother's face.

He knew other boys would arrive soon with all minds of interesting plans for this day. As walking past him, they would tease him for having to work on a beautiful Saturday--which burnt him like fire. He, putting his hands into his pockets and taking out all he owned with the expectation of letting someone paint, found nothing that could buy half an hour of freedom. At this dark and hopeless moment, a wonderful idea occurred to him, pouring a great bright light into his mind. He took up his brush and continued to work pleasantly with calm and quietness. Presently, Ben Rogers came in sight--munching an apple and making joyful noises like the sound of a riverboat as he walked along. Tom went on whitewashing, paying no attention to the steamboat.  \"Hello!\" Ben said, \"I'm going swimming, but you can't go, can you?\" No answer. Tom moved his brush gently along the fence and surveyed the result. Ben came nearer. Tom's mouth watered for Ben's apple while he kept painting the fence. Ben said, \"That's a lot of work, isn't it?\" Tom turned suddenly saying \"Here you are! Ben! I didn't notice you.\" \"I'm going swimming,\" Ben said. \"Don't you wish you could go? Or would you rather work?\" Tom said, \"Work? What do you mean 'work'?\" \"Isn't that work?\" Tom continued painting and answered carelessly, \"Maybe it is, and maybe it isn't. All I know is it suits Tom Sawyer.\" \"Do you mean that you enjoy it?\" \"I don't see why I oughtn't to enjoy it.\" \"Does a boy have a chance to paint a fence frequently\" said Tom. Ben stopped munching his apple. Tom moved his brush back and forth--stepped back to note the effect--added a little paint here and there. Ben watched every move, getting more and more interested, more and more absorbed. After a short time, he said, \"Tom, let me whitewash a little.\" Tom seemed to be thinking for a moment before he said, \"No, Aunt Polly wants this fence to be perfect. If it was the back fence, maybe you could do it. But this fence beside the street is where everybody can see it. It has to be done right.\" \"Oh, come on, let me try. I'll be careful. Listen, Tom. I'll give you part of my apple if you let me paint.\" \"No, Ben, I'm afraid--\" \"I'll give you all the apple!\" Tom handed the brush to Ben with unwillingness on his face but _ in his heart. While the riverboat worked and sweated in the hot sun, Tom, an artist sat in the shade close by, munching his apple, and planning how he could trick more of the boys. Before long there were enough boys each of whom came along the street; stopped to laugh but soon begged to be allowed to paint. By the middle of the afternoon, Tom had got many treasures while the fence had had three layers of whitewash on it. If he hadn't run out of whitewash, he would have owned everything belonging to the boys in the village. Tom said to himself that the world was not so depressing after all.

Experts suggest a possible model way may be \"re-inventing\" a \"garden city\". China's mega-cities are bursting at the borders and the country is now undergoing the quickest and biggest urbanization in the history of mankind. It is estimated that by 2025, China will have 400 million more people living in its cities, raising its urban population to 900 million. Besides, new satellite towns are mushrooming on the urban fringes while city ring roads are rippling outwards into the countryside at amazing speed. Satellite maps collected by Professor Joshua Bolchover at the University of Hong Kong bring the problem sharply into focus. They track the changing rural-urban framework in the past 30 years, and suggest that cities are cruelly destroying surrounding rural land and rapidly reducing the amount of arable   land, which gives way to new residential blocks, new industrial zones, new financial centers and the other inevitable signs and signatures of economic growth. This, however, is not sustainable growth pattern, especially when China has the world's largest population to feed. So concerned urban planners are starting to note the social and physical effects of diaspora   when replaced rural communities are forced into the cities. On the other hand, a trend of thought is gradually taking shape and this is the concept of the \"garden city\", a combination of country and city that is being proposed by architects and city planners. Hua Li, from Tao Architects, is among the many professionals with such a voice. His argument is supported by a long-term study on this subject. As Hua says, the answer is to preserve patches of productive farmland within urban boundaries. Less transportation means we have fresh agricultural products at lower costs and less carbon emission in the city. And urban farmland can also be showcased for agricultural tourism and education. The concept is already practiced at the grassroot level. Agriculture has gone into the air, up to roof and balcony in some communities in the cities. It's common to see organic \"hanging garden\" on the roof of some traditional courtyard home. According to some people, the rooftop project translate to tangible (=\" practical)\" benefits, such as safe, nutritious vegetables, a cooler home in summer. Some say thanks to the tomatoes they plant that are natural insect killers, there're fewer mosquitoes. Apart from these, it also contributes to better bonding with neighbors. Zhang, a doctor in Beijing, began creating his hanging garden five years ago. Since his garden became home to 30 kinds of vegetables and fruit --- all enough to feed his family, neighbors have enjoyed dropping by for a relaxing chat or just to see how well the lovely vegetables and fruit are doing. Although people like Zhang are still rare and the greening of roof space with vegetables and fruit takes skill and energy, with more positive media exposure and advanced technology there is the prospect that garden city will become common practice in the near future.

{"answer": 3, "choices": ["some Chinese expressions are introduced into English", "you'll not be surprised at a tofu in a restaurant in America", "some American expressions can be used in China", "American English keep being enriched from different cultures"], "question": "\"Long time no see\" is a very interesting sentence. When I first read this sentence from an American friend's email, I laughed. I thought it was a perfect example of Chinglish. Obviously, it is a word-by-word literal translation of the Chinese greetings with a ruled English grammar and structure! Later on, my friend told me that it is a standard American greeting. I was too thrilled to believe her. Her words could not convince me at all. So I did a research on google.com. To my surprise, there are over 60 thousand web pages containing \"Long time no see.\" This sentence has been widely used in emails, letters, newspapers, movies, books, or any other possible places. Though it is sort of informal, it is part of the language that Americans use daily. Ironically, if you type this phrase in Microsoft Word, the software will tell you that the grammar needs to be corrected. Nobody knows the origin of this Chinglish sentence. Some people believe that it came from Charlie Chan's movies. In the 1930s, Hollywood moviemakers successfully created a world wide famous Chinese detective named \"Charlie Chan\" on wide screens. Detective Chan likes to teach Americans some Chinese wisdom by quoting Confucius. \"Long time no see\" was his trademark. Soon after Charlie Chan, \"Long time no see\" became a popular phrase in the real world with thanks to the popularity of these movies. Some scholars refer to America as a huge pot of stew. All kinds of culture are mixed in the stew together, and they change the color and taste of each other. American Chinese, though a minority ethnic  group in the United States, is also contributing some changes to the stew! Language is usually the first thing to be influenced in the mixed stew. You can have some other examples than adoptions from Chinese, such as pizza from Italian, susi from Japanese, and deja vu from French etc. There is a long list! Americans do not just simply borrow something from others. They will modify it and make it their own, so you would not be surprised to find a tofu and peanut butter hamburger in a restaurant, or to buy a bottle of iced Chinese green tea with honey in a grocery store.

When I first read this sentence from an American friend's email, I laughed. I thought it was a perfect example of Chinglish. Obviously, it is a word-by-word literal translation of the Chinese greetings with a ruled English grammar and structure! Later on, my friend told me that it is a standard American greeting. I was too thrilled to believe her. Her words could not convince me at all. So I did a research on google.com. To my surprise, there are over 60 thousand web pages containing \"Long time no see.\" This sentence has been widely used in emails, letters, newspapers, movies, books, or any other possible places. Though it is sort of informal, it is part of the language that Americans use daily. Ironically, if you type this phrase in Microsoft Word, the software will tell you that the grammar needs to be corrected. Nobody knows the origin of this Chinglish sentence.

For example, if you pay your children for taking out the rubbish, they see this chore   as a job that they should be rewarded for instead of a responsibility they must fulfill as part of the family. But giving children an allowance for weekly chores is not necessarily bad. You are rewarding them for fulfilling their family responsibilities, but it is not for a specific act. It is an appreciation of their commitment to your family values. You are also conveying another important message that their actions have consequences: if they do good things, good things happen. They also learn a lesson about the market economy, namely that work is rewarded. Allowances can also be used as punishment and to teach children lessons about family values. For example, if your children join a group of kids smashing   pumpkins on Halloween, a part of a reasonable punishment might be to require them to pay the families out of their allowance to replace the pumpkins. Thus, your children learn that bad behavior has financial consequences. Meanwhile, by relating the punishment to the misdeed, you ensure that your children see the connection and learn the value lesson. How much allowance should you pay your children? The precise amount depends on your family's financial situation, the cost of living and your children's needs. Children can start to earn a weekly allowance as early as 5 years of age.

There are all these torrents of passion flowing through you. Your job, as captain of your soul, is to erect dams to keep these passions in check. Your job is to just say no to laziness, lust, greed, drug use and the other sins. These days that model is out of fashion. You usually can't change your behavior by simply resolving to do something. Knowing what to do is not the same as being able to do it. Your willpower is not like a dam that can block the torrent of self-indulgence. It's more like a muscle, which tires easily. Moreover, you're a social being. If everybody around you is overeating, you'll probably do so, too. The 19th-century character model was based on an understanding of free will. Today, we know that free will is bounded. People can change their lives, but ordering change is not simple because many things, even within ourselves, are beyond our direct control. Much of our behavior, for example, is guided by unconscious habits. Researchers at Duke University calculated that more than 40 percent of the actions we take are governed by habit, not actual decisions. Researchers have also come to understand the structure of habits--cue, routine, reward. You can change your own personal habits. If you leave running shorts on the floor at night, that'll be a cue to go running in the morning. Don't try to ignore your afternoon snack craving. Every time you feel the cue for a snack, insert another routine. Take a walk. Their research thus implies a different character model, which is supposed to manipulate the neuralnetworks inside. To be an effective person, under this model, you are supposed to coolly examine your own unconscious habits, and the habits of those under your care. You are supposed to devise strategies to alter the cues and routines. Every relationship becomes slightly manipulative, including your relationship with yourself. You're trying to arouse certain responses by implanting certain cues. This is a bit disturbing, because the important habitual neural networks are not formed by mere routine, nor can they be reversed by clever cues.
