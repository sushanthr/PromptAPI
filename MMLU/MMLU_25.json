She trained as a nurse, but had to give it up when her elder child became seriously ill. \"I would have liked to go back to it, but theshifts  are all wrong for me, as I have to be home to get the children up and off to school.\" So she works as a cleaner instead, from 9 p.m. till 6 a.m. five nights a week for just PS90, before tax and insurance. \"It's better than it was last year, but I still think that people who work 'unsocial hours' should get a bit extra.\" The hours she's chosen to work meant that she sees plenty of the children, but very little of her husband. However, she doesn't think that puts any pressure on their relationship. Her work isn't physically very hard, but it's not exactly pleasant, either. \"I do get angry with people who leave their offices like a place for raising pigs. If they realized people like me have to do it, perhaps they'd be a bit more careful.\" The fact that she's working all night doesn't worry Margaret at all. Unlike some dark buildings at night, the building where she works is fully lit, and the women work in groups of three. \"Since I've got to be here, I try to enjoy myself----and I usually do, because of the other girls. We all have a good laugh, so the time never drags.\" Another challenge Margaret has to face is the reaction of other people when she tells them what she does for a living. \"They think you're a cleaner because you don't know how to read and write,\" said Margaret. \"I used to think _ but I don't think that way any more.

{"answer": 2, "choices": ["help her teacher", "prove an idea", "protect turtles", "become a scientist"], "question": "Where do the turtles go? Every summer, thousands of endangered green sea turtles climb onto beaches around the world. Each mother sea turtle produces 100 or more eggs in a hole, and covers the hole with sand before she swims away. Two months later, the eggs hatch , and the baby turtles climb out of the sand and swim into the ocean. They don't reappear until they have grown as large as dinner plates. Until now, no one knows where the baby turtles go or what they do. \"if we don't know where these little turtles are, we can't protect them,\" says Kim Reich, who helps solve part of the mystery. Her teacher, Karen Bjorndal, has studied green sea turtles for more than 30 years. Every year, Bjorndal goes to the Bahamas Islands. Many young sea turtles come here to live and eat at the end of their childhood. These turtles are the only sea turtles that live as plant eaters. In fact, their name may be a result of what they eat. The turtles don't look green but they do have green fat. Scientists learned that the turtles eat green sea plants, which may turn their fat green. Between 2002 and 2004, Bjorndal caught 44 green sea turtles in the Bahamas. After testing them, she found something to support the 20-year-old idea: baby green sea turtles eat meat before they turn to a diet of plants. In fact, they eat animals that live in the open ocean. Scientists still need to find where exactly green sea turtles grow. We now know that baby green sea turtles are out in the open ocean, but the open ocean is a big place. \" _ is really a problem,\" says Bjorndal.

The hunting of pandas has been banned for many years, so this is not the problem. Destruction of its habitat, when areas are cleared for growing crops, is one of the main reasons for panda's decline . Another reason is that the bamboo on which they mainly feed, is dying back. The pandas find it difficult to move to new feeding areas. As the bamboo disappears, the pandas simply starve to death.      Bamboo is a poor source of food, and pandas have to eat up 45kg of it every day, a process that takes them up to 16 hours. The process goes on day and night, with the pandas in a constant cycle of eating for eight hours and sleeping for four. They can eat other foods, but will rather starve than change their diet when bamboo is scarce.    Giant pandas are very good climbers, and use this skill to escape from the enemy. The giant panda lives alone for most of its life, only coming together with another of its species for long enough to mate.

{"answer": 0, "choices": ["improving his life", "honoring his grandfather", "helping do research for cancer", "supporting people with cancer"], "question": "My family had always been close and lucky. No one died and no one was sick. We were all living a happy life until my grandfather had cancer. No matter how much I told myself he might not die, somehow I still felt as if it was a death sentence. He fought so hard but died at 63. I honestly didn't know how I dealt with. I never cried alone. I had the support of my family and teachers. I just remembered my grandfather's wish that we should celebrate his life.  That's how we came up with the idea for Hives   for Lives -- a business my sister and I started where all the profits   go to the American Cancer Society (ACS). During our first year we donated   more than $2,000 to the ACS. The next year a man who belonged to my grandparents' \"bee club\" gave his honey to us, and our little business grew. We sold at wine festivals, schools, and to anyone else who would buy! We had my uncle sell in California and my grandmother sell in Chicago. We have sold honey in 13 states -- even in Puerto Rico! This year we donated more than $10,000 to the ACS and we're hoping to do more next year.

No one died and no one was sick. We were all living a happy life until my grandfather had cancer. No matter how much I told myself he might not die, somehow I still felt as if it was a death sentence. He fought so hard but died at 63. I honestly didn't know how I dealt with. I never cried alone. I had the support of my family and teachers. I just remembered my grandfather's wish that we should celebrate his life.  That's how we came up with the idea for Hives   for Lives -- a business my sister and I started where all the profits   go to the American Cancer Society (ACS). During our first year we donated   more than $2,000 to the ACS. The next year a man who belonged to my grandparents' \"bee club\" gave his honey to us, and our little business grew. We sold at wine festivals, schools, and to anyone else who would buy! We had my uncle sell in California and my grandmother sell in Chicago. We have sold honey in 13 states -- even in Puerto Rico! This year we donated more than $10,000 to the ACS and we're hoping to do more next year. Hopefully our business will help research into the causes of cancer or just improve the life of someone with cancer. I feel like Hives for Lives is a way to honor my grandfather.

Well, he's probably right. According to a new research published in the journal Intelligence, the oldest children in families are likely to have the highest IQs and the youngest the lowest. A number of studies have suggested that IQ scores decline with birth order. In the most recent study, at Vrije University, Amsterdam, researchers looked at men and women whose IQ had been tested at the ages of 5,12 ,and 18. The results , which show a trend for the oldest to score better than the youngest in each test, involved about 200,000 people. That showed that first-borns had a three-point IQ advantage over the second-born, who was a point ahead of the next in line. The order of birth can also affect personality, achievement, and career, with first-borns being more academically successful and more likely to win Nobel prizes. However, eldest children are less likely to be radical and pioneering. Charles Darwin, for example, was the fifth child of six. Exactly why there should be such differences is not clear, and there are a number of theories on environmental influences on the child. The so-called dilution  theory suggests that as family resources, both emotional and physical, as well as economic, are limited, it follows that, as a result , as more children come along, the levels of parental attention and encouragement will drop. Another theory is that the intellectual environment in the family favors the first-born who has, at least for some time, the benefit of individual care and help. The theory which enjoys the most support is that the extra time and patience that the earlier-borns get from their parents, compared with those arriving later, gives them an advantage.

I made my password Forgive@h3r. I had to type this statement several times a day. Each time my computer would lock. Each time my screen saver with her photo would appear. Each time I would come back from eating lunch alone. In my mind, I wrote \"forgive her\" every day. The simple action changed the way I looked at my ex-wife. That constant reminder led me to accept the way things had happened at the end of my marriage and adopt a new way of dealing with my depression. As the month wore on, I felt slow healing began to take place. By the time my server reminded me to reset my password the following month, I felt free.

Police animal trainer Jose Pineda says that rats have more sensitive noses than dogs, which should allow them to better smell out mines in difficult terrain  . Plus, it takes the police about six months to train mine-smelling dogs. Training the rats is expected to take about half that time once the program is established.

Many ryokans sprang up in the 17th century to put up feudal lords traveling along the Tokaido highway to Edo(now Tokyo). Today tourists looking for a taste of the country's historic lifestyle find varying levels of understated elegance in ryokans throughout the country. A typical stay starts with a greeting from the inn's staff and a change from street shoes into slippers .An attendant leads guests to their rooms, where slippers are removed before walking on the rice-straw flooring, called tatami. Walking slowly along behind a kimonoclad attendant on the creaky wood floors of Fukuzumiro ryokan,s hallways is like stepping back in time. The inn was established in 1890 by a former samurai . Tim Paterson ,33, a banker living in Tokyo, has stayed at several ryokans. This New Zealand native leaves after a recent stay at Fukuzumiro. \"I think it's quite good mixing culture with history and not just going to see it ,but living in it, staying in it,\"he said. Sliding glass doors line the inn's rural hallways, bringing in the sound of tricking water and the quietness of the stone and tree-filled courtyards outside.

In the past decades the western Antarctic has seen rapid ice loss as the world has warmed, but the other parts of the continent have, , been cooling, resulting in a 10% increase in ice in the seas around the region. This is because the hole in the ozone layer has increased cold winds in Antarctic, making much of the continent surface colder than usual. But now that the gases that cause the ozone hole have been banned, scientists expect the hole to repair itself within the next 50 to 60 years. By then the cooling effect will have faded out and the Antarctic will face the full impact of global warming. This means an increase in average air temperatures of around 3degC and a reduction in sea ice by around a third. The biggest threat to the continent comes from warming seas. Robert Johnson, a scientist who monitors Antarctic ice sheets, said, \"The ice sheets in Antarctic are hundreds of meters thick. But once warm ocean waters start flowing underneath, the ice will begin thinning and could break up very quickly.\" Thinning ice sheets cause ice to break away from the continent and to melt even faster. Escaping ice from western Antarctic has already resulted in a 10% rise in global sea level in recent decades. Johnson believes that international action to reduce global warming is required immediately or it may be too late. \"Everything is connected----Antarctic may be a long way away but it is an important part of the Earth's system,\" said Johnson. \"It contains 90% of the world's ice, 70% of the world's fresh water and that is enough, if it melts completely, to raise sea levels by 63 meters.\" Even in a worse-case situation scientists don't expect the ice to entirely disappear, but predict that, because of the melting ice sheets, average sea level rise will be around 1.4 meters higher by the end of the century.

Dr. Sotaro Kita of the University of Bristol's Department of Experimental Psychology  , showed the cartoon to a group of native English, Japanese and Turkish speakers and then watched their gestures as they described the actions they had seen. He found speakers of the three different languages used different gestures to describe the same event, which appeared to reflect the way the structure of their languages expressed that event. For example, when describing a scene where the cat swings on a rope, the English speakers used gestures showing an arc trajectory    and the Japanese and Turkish speakers tended to use straight gestures showing the motion but not the arc. Dr. Kita suggests this is because Japanese and Turkish have no proper verb to express the English meaning \"to swing\". While English speakers use the arc gesture as their language can readily express the change of location and the arc-shaped trajectory, Japanese and Turkish speakers cannot as easily express the idea of movement with an arc trajectory so they use the straight gesture.

Advertising campaigns have, however, promoted a growing realization of the advantages of these small pieces of plastic. They prevent need to carry large amounts of cash and are always useful in emergencies.

I noticed a small boy of about five years old, pressing a doll against his chest.Keeping on touching the hair of the doll, the boy murmured sadly, \"I don't have enough money.What can I do?\" I walked towards him and asked him curiously who he wanted to give the doll to. \" It is the doll that my sister loved most and wanted so much for this Christmas.She was so sure that Santa Claus would bring it to her.\" I told him that maybe Santa Claus would bring it to her after all and not to worry.However, he replied sadly, \" No, Santa Claus cannot take it to where she is now.I have to give the doll to my mother so that she can give it to her when she goes there.\" His eyes looked so sad while saying this. \" My sister has gone to be with God.Daddy says that Mommy will also join God very soon so I think that she can take the doll with her to give it to my sister.\" My heart nearly stopped. The boy looked up at me and said, \" I told Daddy to tell Mommy not to go yet.I asked him to wait until I come back from the store.\" Then, he showed me a very nice photo of him where he was laughing.He told me, \" I also want Mommy to take this photo with her so that she will not forget me, I love my Mommy and I wish she didn't have to leave me but Daddy says that she has to go and join my little sister.\" Then he looked at the doll again quietly with sad eyes. I quickly reached my hand into my pocket, saying, \"What if we checked again, just in case, to see if you have enough money?\" What would happen at the end of the story?", "subject": ""}

If this happens often you probably have a pretty capable working memory and a sharper brain, new research suggests. This mind wandering, it seems, actually gives your working memory a workout. Working memory is the mental work space that allows the brain to _ multiple thoughts at the same time. The more working memory a person has, the more daydreaming they can do without forgetting the task at hand. Researchers studied groups of people from the University of Wisconsin-Madison community, ranging in age from 18 to 65. The volunteers were asked to perform simple tasks, like pressing a button every time they took a breath or clicking in response to a letter popping up on a computer screen; these tasks were so easy that their minds were likely to wander, the researchers figured. The researchers checked in periodically, asking the participants if their minds were on task or wandering. When the task was over, they measured each participant's working memory capacity by having them remember letters while doing math questions. Though all participants performed well on the task, the researchers noticed that the individuals who indicated their minds had wandered more than others also scored higher on the working memory test. \"What this study seems to suggest is that, when circumstances for the task aren't very difficult, people who have additional working memory resources allocate them to think about things other than what they're doing,\" said Jonathan Smallwood, a study researcher of the Max Planck Institute for Human Cognitve and Brain Science. When our minds run out of working memory, these off-topic thoughts can take the main stage without us consciously meaning them to; for instance, arriving at home with no memory of the actual trip, or suddenly realizing that they've turned several pages in a book without understanding any of the words. \"It's almost like your attention was so absorbed in the mind wandering that there wasn't any left over to remember your goal to read,\" study researcher Daniel Levinson, said in a statement. People with overall higher working memory were better able to stay focused when the task at hand required it. Those who had low working memory often had their thoughts drift away from the task, and did less well at it. The findings add to past research suggesting these mind drifts can be positive moments. For instance, daydreaming has often been associated with creativity--researchers think that our most creative and inventive moments come when daydreaming. It's likely that the most intelligent among us also have high levels of working memory, Levinson noted. What can be concluded from Jonathan Smallwood's words?", "subject": ""}

When a bird flaps  its wings, it stirs the air around it and causes it to move indifferent directions.

According to the book, there are lots of misunderstandings of obesity. 1. If you're obese, blame your genes. Obesity rates have increased. Yet, between 1980 and 2000, the number of Americans who are obese has doubled--too quickly for genetic factors to be responsible. At restaurants, a dollar puts more calories on our plates than ever before, because restaurant meals usually have more calories than what we prepare at home, so people who eat out more frequently have higher rates of obesity than those who eat out less. 2. If you're obese, you lack self-control. Research shows that if we are faced with too much information, we have a tendency to make poor dietary choices. Our world has become so rich in temptation that we can be led to consume too much in ways we can't understand. Even the most vigilant  people may not be up to the task of controlling themselves. 3. Lack of access to fresh fruits and vegetables is responsible for obesity. Although the US Department of Agriculture estimates that fewer than 5 percent of Americans live in the \"food deserts\", about 65 percent of the nation's population is overweight or obese. For most of us, obesity is not related to access to more fresh fruits and vegetables, but to the choices we make in supermarkets. 4. The problem is not that we eat too much, but that we don't exercise. Michelle Obama's \"Let's Move\" campaign is based on the idea that if kids exercise more, childhood obesity rates will decrease. But there was no significant decrease in physical activity levels as obesity rates climbed in the 1980s and 1990s. In fact, although a drop in work-related physical activity may account for up to 100 fewer calories burned, leisure physical activity appears to have increased. The problem is that we eat too much.

Algae,like corn,soybeans,and other crops,grow via photosynthesis   and can be processed into fuel oil.However,they _ 30 times more energy than land crops such as soybeans,according to the U.S.Department of Energy.Many algae species also can grow in saltwater and polluted water-while corn and soy require arable land and fresh water that will be in short supply as the world's population balloons. \"If you replaced all the diesel   in the U.S.with soy biodiesel,it would take half the land mass of the U.S.to grow those soybeans,\"says Matt Caspari,chief executive of Aurora Biofuels,a Berkeley,Calif.-based private firm that specializes in algae oil technology.On the other hand,the Energy Department says that if algae fuel replaced all the petroleum fuel in the United States,it would require 15,000 square miles,which is a few thousand miles larger that Maryland (12,407 square miles),the 42nd state in land area. Another bonus:Because algae can be grown just about anywhere in a closed space,they 're being tested at several power plants across the nation as a carbon absorber.Smokestack emissions   can be pumped directly into the ponds,feeding the algae while keeping greenhouse gases out of the atmosphere. Although processing technology for algae fuel--also known as \"oilgae\" in some environmentalist circles--is improving,it's still years away from reaching your local gas pump.\"It's just a question of cost,because no large-scale facilities have been built yet,\" Caspari says.

But, in fact, it could offer the prospect of a better future for work. Universal employment, as its history show, hasn't meant economic freedom. Employment became widespread when the enclosures of the 17th and 18th centuries made many people dependent on paid work by taking them away from the use of the land, and thus from the means to provide a living for themselves. Then the factory system destroyed the cottage industries and removed work from people's homes. Later, as transport improved, first by rail and then by road, people traveled longer distances to their place of employment until, eventually, many people's work lost all connection with their home lives and the places in which they lived.

At ERCOT, we have been working around the clock to keep the electricity flowing, making sure you have the resources you need to stay productive and well this summer. While we are always charged with making sure you have adequate electricity, this summer has caused a particularly serious challenge to the electric grid . Because the heat has been sustained over the entire state with little or no rain or cloud cover, the strain on the electric grid has been greater than ever before. In Dallas and Austin, we are beating all-time records for triple-digit heat. We have hit three all-time demand peaks in the last two weeks alone, meaning we've used more electricity on three days this summer than on any other day in the history of ERCOT, which covers most of Texas. Additionally, Texas is experiencing economic and population growth while much of the rest of the country is not. All of these factors are contributing to very high energy usage this summer. As you probably read in your newspaper or saw on the news, ERCOT has issued appeals for conservation across the state this August. We have encouraged businesses and residential customers to help us save electricity between the critical hours of 3 and 7 p.m. For instance, turning off unnecessary lights, appliances and electronic equipment can help conditions significantly. Conservation efforts help us avoid statewide rotating outages and keep your lights on and air-conditioners running. Conservation not only keeps power and cool air flowing to every citizen, it ensures that uninterrupted power flows to critical care customers, who are easily harmed in the extreme heat. While ERCOT has not called for rotating outages this summer, it is important to remember that we only carry out these orderly, temporary outages to prevent a catastrophic collapse of the electric grid. As you may remember from the Northeast blackout a few years ago, once a grid failure occurs, it can take days to restore power to all consumers.

The most difficult part of this mini-project is choosing the message that you'll write with your invisible ink. Maybe you'll want to pretend that you're a spy on a secret mission, writing messages that would lead to big, big trouble if they were discovered. Choose your words carefully. All you need to do is, using the brush of cotton swab, write your message with milk on the paper. Don't use a lot of milk and soak the paper. Use just enough to make a thin coating. Once you've finished writing, ask the adult who's helping you to turn on the kitchen stove to a low heat. Very carefully, using kitchen mitts ,hold the paper about a foot above the warm burner. If you don't see results, you may have to make the burner a little hotter. Do not, however, hold the paper low over the burner. As the paper heats up, your message will become brown and you'll be able to see what was written. You want to know why? It's because chemical compounds in the milk have a low burning point.

{"answer": 1, "choices": ["Appropriate pay", "Your inner feeling", "Your life goals", "The environment around you"], "question": "I had lunch with a friend of mine the other day and she said something that I found surprising: \"Work is paid slavery.\" My friend wanted more control over her work hours, income, etc., but you can imagine that if \"work is serving someone,\" she won't have much luck until that belief changes. When I asked her where that belief came from, she said her father. Most of us spend many of our waking hours at work. How we think about those hours will determine how good or bad we feel about our lives. How would you complete the sentence: \"Work is....\"? How many of us say that work is fulfilling? How many say work is fun? Changing Limiting Beliefs Almost everyone I talk to has limiting beliefs about money or work. I worked with my friend using the walking belief change described in Debug Your Mental Software. When it came time to come up with a new belief, she struggled. She even asked me: \"What's the opposite of slavery?\" So strong was the old belief that she couldn't think of the opposite. What's Your Work Belief? If you think work is bad, you'll end up working in an unfulfilling job regardless of how much it pays. If you think work is freedom, you'll enjoy your work because it fulfills you. I call it \"soul work.\" If you're doing the work you love, it will be energizing, freeing. Much of our work ethic  starts in childhood by watching our parents. How did they talk about work? Did they hate it, or did they love it? The truth is probably somewhere in between. Many of us say we don't want a job \"like my parent had\" or a job where they're stuck inside a small room. But many of us end up with jobs like that. Sometimes it's how we approach the tasks of our jobs that make the difference. It's possible to make even the most ordinary job meaningful and fulfilling. If it isn't possible for you to do that, then it is time to think about \"evolving out of the job\". Sometimes just quitting a job because it's boring is the wrong thing to do, but thinking about where you want to be and if you need more education is a good idea. Some young people seem to have trouble starting jobs or finishing college. Has our economy discouraged them? A recent movie I saw had a grown man (over thirty) telling his friends that he's a \"stay-at-home-son.\" Truth is sometimes stranger than fiction.   I had breakfast at my local Perkins yesterday. Kristin took my order. She was bubbly and full of energy compared to the other waitresses. I watched as she remembered everything a family of four staying at a neighboring hotel had ordered the day before. Kristin loved people and loved her job. She has the kind of attitude and work ethic that employers crave. What's your work belief? Does it limit you? Could you tune it up to live a better life right now? If most of us are going to spend 30 years working, shouldn't we try to make it enjoyable? Could it be that work is freedom or right work is energizing or something even better?

I call it \"soul work.\" If you're doing the work you love, it will be energizing, freeing. Much of our work ethic  starts in childhood by watching our parents. How did they talk about work? Did they hate it, or did they love it? The truth is probably somewhere in between. Many of us say we don't want a job \"like my parent had\" or a job where they're stuck inside a small room. But many of us end up with jobs like that. Sometimes it's how we approach the tasks of our jobs that make the difference. It's possible to make even the most ordinary job meaningful and fulfilling. If it isn't possible for you to do that, then it is time to think about \"evolving out of the job\". Sometimes just quitting a job because it's boring is the wrong thing to do, but thinking about where you want to be and if you need more education is a good idea. Some young people seem to have trouble starting jobs or finishing college. Has our economy discouraged them? A recent movie I saw had a grown man (over thirty) telling his friends that he's a \"stay-at-home-son.\" Truth is sometimes stranger than fiction.   I had breakfast at my local Perkins yesterday. Kristin took my order. She was bubbly and full of energy compared to the other waitresses. I watched as she remembered everything a family of four staying at a neighboring hotel had ordered the day before. Kristin loved people and loved her job. She has the kind of attitude and work ethic that employers crave. What's your work belief? Does it limit you? Could you tune it up to live a better life right now? If most of us are going to spend 30 years working, shouldn't we try to make it enjoyable? Could it be that work is freedom or right work is energizing or something even better?

Indian tutors are helping to teach math to British children over high-speed Internet connections. Early results suggest the idea is improving exam results. But not everyone is happy at this \"outsourcing\" of tutoring. It's 3:30, and pupils at Raynham Primary School in London are gathering for their after-school maths lessons. Five time zones-- thousands of kilometers away--their math tutors are also arriving for class. High-speed Internet has made it possible for Indian tutors to teach British pupils in real time. Each pupil gets a dedicated one-to-one online tutor. The students work with activities on their computer screen and wear a headset and microphone to talk to their tutor. The class teacher, Altus Basson, says he has seen an improvement in results. \"There are some children who've really rocketed in their results. Children who struggleto focus in class focus a lot better on the laptops. The real advantage is that each child gets a focused activity and a single tutor,\" he said. Such individualized teaching is the core idea of Brightspark Education, the company that provides the online tutoring, says founder Tom Hooper. \"Children today feel very confident online; they feel very engaged; they feel very in control. And that's half the battle with education.Give them control, make them feel confident and enjoy their learning and you'll see them start to improve and embrace it,\" he said. Raynham Primary School is among the first in Europe to try online tutoring. At between $20 and $25 an hour, it's about half the cost of face-to-face coaching.

Kevin Courtney is deputy General Secretary of Britain's National Union of Teachers. \"We think, there's a really important emotional connection between a teacher and a child whether it's a whole class or whether it's one-to-one. You need that immediacy of feedback and we're not convinced that that can happen across an Internet connection. In one of the wealthiest.countries in the world, we think that we can afford to have teachers with genuine emotional connection there with the children,\" he said. Brightspark Education says the online tutoring is used only as an addition to supplement regular teaching. The company says its service does not represent a threat to teachers' jobs in Britain. Parents say they're very satisfied with the results they've seen. And what about the children?Children: \"I love it!\"I love it!\"I hate maths!\" So math--or, as the British call it, maths--is still not everyone's favorite subject even with the latest technology to teach it.

Many people are put off by the idea of \"chemicals in food.\" The truth is that all food is made up of chemicals. Natural substances like milk, as well as man-made ones like drinks on sale in the market, can be described by chemical formulas. Some chemical substances are indeed harmful, but a person who refused to consume any chemicals would find nothing to eat. The things we eat can be divided into natural and man-made substances. Some people feel that only natural foods are healthy and that all man-made ingredients are to be avoided. But many natural chemicals, found in plants and animals, are harmful when eaten, and some laboratory-made substances increase the nutritional value of food. Other chemicals have natural and man-made forms that are exactly alike: vitamin C is vitamin C, whether it comes from a test tube or from an orange.

We add sugar and salt and other things to foods we prepare at home to make them taste better. Food producers have developed a range of additives that stabilize, thicken, harden, keep wet, keep firm, or improve the appearance of their products.

If he disapproved of an employee's work, he often shamed him. \"This is who I am,\" he once said after being challenged,\"and you can't expect me to be someone I'm not. \" This disgusting personality wasn't always helpful,but it served a purpose, writes Mr. Isaacson, many would \"end their chain of horror stories by saying that he got them to do things they never dreamed possible. \" Mr. Isaacson treats \"Steve Jobs\" as the biography of record, which means that it is a strange book to read so soon after its subject's death.

It's the story of the three little pigs and the big bad wolf that blew down a house made of straw and one made of sticks. The only house left standing was the one made of bricks. Now there is new evidence to suggest that houses built with bales of straw can be very strong. They are also very environmental. Pete Walker is a professor at the University of Bath in Britain. He and a team of researchers there have built a house made out of straw bales and hemp material. During the next twelve months the team will study the effectiveness of these materials in home building. Professor Walker says there are many good reasons for using straw. Professor Walker: \"One of the benefits is it's a relatively inexpensive renewable material that's readily available.\" He also agrees that straw takes in carbon dioxide as it grows and helps the environment in other ways. So it can be seen as having no harmful effects on the environment. Professor Walker: \"The straw bale walls are relatively thick and so all that straw provides very good thermal insulation. So we make buildings that require very little heating in the winter or indeed very little cooling in the summer. So they require very little additional energy.\" Professor Walker says this reduces home operating expenses. It also reduces the effect on the environment. He says the current interest in straw bale houses is a direct response to the problem of climate change. David Lanfear owns an eco-friendly home building service in the United States called Bale on Bale Construction. He says he laughed when some friends first told him about houses built of straw. But after doing his own research, he learned that building with straw bales made a lot of sense. He has now helped to build more than ten straw bale houses and says the building material is becoming more widely accepted. To build the houses, he fills a wood frame with tightly packed bales of straw. Next he coats the walls inside and out with layers of clay plaster. He says the common ideas about straw houses continue, including stories about the threat of fire. Mr. Lanfear says straw bale houses have done well when tested for fire resistance. And he says his builders use the same building methods as traditional builders to keep out rain.

Born in 356 B.C., Alexander III was the son of Philip II and Olympias. Alexander's parents wanted him to receive the finest education, and arranged for him to study under Aristotle, regarded as one of the greatest scholars. Alexander's father was a strong leader. Philip II built an impressive army and established the Macedonian kingdom; he was even planning to attack Persia shortly before his death. In 336, Philip was murdered by one of his guards. Although it was obvious that the guard had a personal hatred, there are clues that other people were related to it. After Alexander was cleared as a suspect, he succeeded his father without opposition, and killed those said to be responsible for his father's murder, as well as all rivals.

{"answer": 0, "choices": ["missed some important culture of China.", "covered so much about trader's life.", "was full of obvious mistakes.", "seemed less detailed."], "question": "As early as the mid-18th century, some people began raising doubts about Marco Polo's travels. They pointed to seemingly obvious omissions in his descriptions of the Far East. In 1995,historian Frances Wood argued in her book \"Did Marco Polo Go to China?\" that the famous explorer from Venice never made it pass the Black Sea. She noted that his travel journal \" The travels of Marco Polo\" left out the Great Wall of China, chopsticks and tea drinking among other details. Furthermore, Chinese documents from Polo's day make no mention of the explorer and his men. Wood and other scholars have argued that Marco Polo based his tales of China on information collected from fellow trades who had actually been there. Last year, a team of Italian researchers became the latest skeptics to challenge Polo's accounts. They said that archaeological evidence didn't support his description of Kublai Khan's Japanese invasions. Now, however, research by Hans Ulrich Vogel of Germany's Tubingen University might help prove Marco Polo was true. In a new book \" Marco Polo Was in China\", the professor of Chinese history counters the arguments most frequently made by skeptics. He tries to prove that Marco Polo spoke the truth. He suggests, for example, that Polo didn't included the Great Wall in his book because it only achieved its great importance under the Ming Dynasty, several hundred years later. Vogel further explains that Chinese records from the 13thand 14thcenturies routinely avoided setting down visits from Westerners. Historians before him have touched on these issues while defending Marco Polo's honor. But Vogel also relies on another evidence: the explorer's very detailed descriptions of currency and salt production in the Yuan Dynasty. According to Vogel, Polo documented these aspects of Mongol Chinese culture in greater detail than any other of his time. This is a hint that the Venetian relied on his own powers of observation. Will we ever know whether Marco Polo traveled to China? Perhaps not, but the consequences of his real of fictional journey are still felt across the globe. One reader of \"The travels of Marco Polo\" was Christopher Columbus, who stepped upon the New World while following in his Venetian idol's footsteps. France Wood doubted Marco Polo's travel's to China because his description  _  .", "subject": ""}

But when he was 15 he suddenly stopped trying. He left school at 16 with only two scores for secondary school subjects.

The lack of right male  role models in many of their lives -- at home and particularly in the school environment  -- means that their peers are the only people they have to judge themselves against. They don't see men succeeding in society so it doesn't occur to them that they could make something of themselves. Without male teachers as a role model, the effect of peer actions and street culture  is all-powerful. Boys want to be part of a club. However, schools can provide the environment for change, and provide the right role models for them. Teachers need to be trained to stop that but not in front of a child's peers. You have to do it one to one, because that is when you see the real child. It's pointless sending a child home if he or she has done wrong. They see it as a welcome day off to watch television or play computer games.

Sometimes development can do more harm than good for a country. Therefore, this development needs to be different from past development, which polluted the environment and wasted natural resources. One possible solution to this problem now being discussed is sustainable development. It focuses on preserving the environment and natural resources. It is all about creating better health care, education, housing and improved standard of living for everyone. This is a simple idea, but one that is hard to put into practice. However, it is something that we must do, because without sustainable development our future and the lives of our children and our grandchildren will be in danger. Nearly everything we do in our modern lives requires the use of the Earth's natural resources. These natural resources provide the energy for many important things. The list is almost endless. For all these things, we mostly depend on fuels such as coal, gas and oil to produce energy. We are now consuming these fuels at a much higher rate than they are being produced. On top of this, burning these fuels produces carbon dioxide, which is harmful to the environment. This is why many people are pushing for the use of alternative energy sources. Alternative energy sources can be used without running out. Some examples of the alternatives are solar energy, wind energy and hydroelectricity. As people are becoming more aware of the need to protect the environment, these types of energy are becoming more and more popular. In many parts of the world, tentative  steps are being taken to introduce these forms of alternative energy. For example, some people in Nigeria are training to use solar power, and in Costa Rica, people are now using hydroelectricity to provide power for their small villages.

I went to work at M.I.T.'s Instrumentation Labs on a project designed to create a rescue vehicle for lost submarines . I thought this job would keep me out of the draft, but M.I.T. hadn't put in the proper paperwork and I got called in for my physical. The day before my physical, I broke my ankle playing tennis and, of course, my draft board didn't believe a word of it. I had to provide X-rays. I had tears in my eyes from the pain, but a smile on my face.  I started John Snow Inc. in 1978 (Dr. Snow is considered the father of modern epidemiology because he traced the source of a cholera epidemic in the 1850s). We had a very clear vision of what we would be. It would not be about making the most money but having the most impact.  My goal was to attract talented people who had that passion to focus on primary care, women's health, child health, and to do great work. I also run a nonprofit called World Education, which focuses on literacy. What motivates me is going to the field, either in the United States or overseas, and seeing the people whose lives we affect.  I didn't grow up rich but had the advantage of growing up in the United States and getting a good education. I couldn't have started J.S.I. in many other places. And I believe there is a duty to try and assist people who are struggling against tough situations. According to the passage, we know that  _  .", "subject": ""}
{"answer": 2, "choices": ["A soft plastic cup.", "A pencil eraser.", "A baby milk bottle.", "A new perfume."], "question": "Plastic is everywhere because plastic is an extremely useful material. It is cheap, strong and lightweight. What's more, it can take on nearly any form or shape, from soft and stretchy   to hard and glasslike. Plastic, however, is far from perfect. It may even be bad for us. Studies now suggest that poisonous chemicals can get out of some types of plastic, get into our bodies, and cause a variety of health problems, including cancer, birth defects and attention deficit hyperactivity disorder  . Two types of chemicals in particular have raised special concern lately. They are called phthalates   and Bisphenol-A  , BPA for short. Not all plastic products contain them. But the ones that do are surrounded by controversy  . That's because experts disagree on how dangerous these chemicals are. Plastic is a single word, but plastic isn't just one thing. What all plastics share in common are plasticizers -- special chemicals that allow the material to be changed into nearly any shape or texture. Plasticizers   are added to plastic during the manufacturing process. Phthalates and BPA are two types of plasticizers that work in different ways. Phthalates add softness to things like shampoo bottles, raincoats and rubber. They are also used in perfumes and makeup. BPA, on the other hand, gives a hard, clear, almost glasslike feel to products such as infant bottles. BPA also appears in food and soda cans, DVDs and other unexpected places. How do these chemicals get into us? When plastic is heated in the microwave or dishwasher, chewed on or scratched, the chemicals can seep   out of the plastic. Even though we can't see them, we eat them, drink them and breathe them in. Scientists and parents are especially worried about young children, who tend to chew on everything, including plastic. Dozens of countries, including the European Union, Japan, Canada and Mexico have already banned phthalates from products made for children younger than three. California and Washington have done the same. And a number of other states are considering similar rules. As for BPA, Canada became the first country to ban the chemical from baby bottles.

These never change. What one experiences in a barber's shop the first time he enters one is what he always experiences in barbers' shops afterward till the end of his days. I got shaved this morning as usual. A man approached the door from Jones Street as I approached it from Main--a thing that always happens. I hurried up, but it was of no use; he entered the door one little step ahead of me, and I followed in and saw him take the only empty chair, the one headed by the best barber. It always happens so. I sat down, hoping that I might sit in the chair belonging to the better of the remaining two barbers, for he was a bit ahead. I watched the probabilities with strong interest. When I saw that No. 2 was gaining on No. 1, my interest grew to solicitude  . When No. 1 was gradually losing the race, my solicitude rose to anxiety. When No. 1 caught up again, and both were about to finish and say \"Next!\" first, my very breath stood still with the _ .

{"answer": 3, "choices": ["Defensive.", "Persuasive.", "Supportive.", "Objective."], "question": "Did you know that women's brains are smaller than men's? The average women's brain weighs 10% less than men's. Since research has shown that the bigger the brain, the cleverer the animal, men must be more intelligent than women. Right? Wrong. Men and women always score similarly on intelligence tests, despite the difference in brain size. Why? After years of study, researchers have concluded that it's what's inside that matters, not just the size of the brain. The brain consists of \"grey matter\" and  \"white matter\". While men have more of the latter, the amount of \"thinking\" brain is almost exactly the same in both sexes. It has been suggested that smaller brain appears to work faster, perhaps because the two sides of the brain are better connected in women. This means that little girls tend to learn to speak earlier, and that women can understand sorts of information from different sources at the same time. When it comes to talking to the boss on the phone, cooking dinner and keeping an eye on the baby all at the same time, it's women who come out on top every time. There are other important differences between two sexes. As white matter is the key to spatial   tasks, men know better where things are in relation to other things. \"A great footballer always knows where he is in relation to the other players, and he knows where to go,\" says one researcher. That may explain one of life's great mysteries: Why men refuse to ask for directions ... and women often need to! The differences begin when fetuses   are about nine weeks old, which can be seen in the action of children as young as one. A boy would try to climb a barrier before him or push it down while a girl would attract help from others. These brain differences also explain the fact that more men take up jobs that require good spatial skills, while more women speech skills. It may all go back to our ancestors, among whom women needed speech skills to take care of their babies and men needed spatial skills to hunt, according to one research. If all this disappoints you, it shouldn't. \"The brain changes throughout our lives according to what we do with it,\" says a biologist.

Every building in these countries collects the rainwater from its roof and stores it for later use. However, America is just slightly slow to take action.

These pirates then sell those recordings on the street or over the Internet for very low prices. Some share them for free. \"It's unfair for people to pirate movies, \" says 15-year-old Hadaia Azad Ezzulddin. Movie piracy \"takes money out of the pockets of thousands of people in the movie industry,\" she notes. Victims include famous actors and directors as well as local theater owners and their employees. Hadaia came up with an idea that could help stop movie piracy. Hadaia's idea uses infrared  light. This range of light is invisible to the human eye. It is visible, however, to many types of cameras. Theater owners could place small infrared lights on their movie screens. The lights would not disturb people watching the movie. It would, however, distort the recordings made by many types of cameras. To test her idea, Hadaia built a box with a movie screen inside. Then, she projected images on that screen through a hole in the box. She took recordings of those images, using nine different types of cameras. These included the types found in cell phones as well as camcorders. During some tests, she also turned on light emitting diodes , or LEDs. The LEDs were embedded  in a certain place behind the movie screen. They gave out infrared light. Sure enough, she showed, a pirated movie included odd stripes or spots if it had been recorded while the LEDs were on. It might be possible to use the LEDs to flash the date and time on the movie screen. The information would then appear in the illegal recordings. Theater owners or police might use the information to track down the pirates. Cutting down on piracy might get more people into theaters to watch the real movie instead of an illegal copy. Six out of every ten films now produced aren't profitable. They don't make enough money to recover how much was spent to make and market them. Such a poor payback can discourage filmmakers from producing anything but the types expected to become blockbuster hits. It might also keep smaller theaters from showing a wider variety of movie types. Infrared lights are put on the movie screens to   _  .", "subject": ""}

This is the belief of a group of physicians, who came up with the 'sitting-rising test' to measure their patients' flexibility and strength. They developed a scoring system for the test and found that people who scored three points or less out of 10, were more than five times as likely to die within six years, as those who scored more than eight points. Claudio Gil Araujo, of Gama Filho University in Rio de Janeiro, Brazil, was among the doctors who originally developed the sitting rising test (SRT) to quickly assess the flexibility of athletes, but he now uses it to persuade his patients that they need to stay active to maintain their muscle and balance, and live longer, Discover Magazine reported. As we age, our muscles tend to become weaker and a loss of balance means we are increasingly likely to fall. Current ways to test frailty can be time-consuming, impractical and inaccurate for small doctors' surgeries, but experts are keen to keep older people moving. Dr Araujo says that anyone can take the SRT because no equipment is needed. In a study, published in the European Journal of Cardiology, the researchers described how 2002 adults aged between 51 and 80 took the SRT at Clinimex Exercise Medicine Clinic in Rio. They found that patients who scored fewer than eight points out of 10 on the test, were twice as likely to die within the next six years, compared with people with more perfect scores. One point was deducted each time a person used their hand or knee for support to either sit down or stand up, while half a point was deducted for losing their balance. The experts found that people who scored three points or fewer, were more than five times as likely to die within the same period. They wrote in the study: 'Musculoskeletal fitness, as assessed by SRT, was a significant predictor of _ in 51-80-year-old subjects.' The study found that every point increase in the test, was linked to a 21 per cent decrease in mortality from all causes.

Now a research by Cornell University suggests how life style and decisions about eating may affect weight. Researchers conclude that the French tend   to stop eating when they feel full. However, Americans tend to stop when their plate is empty or their favorite TV show is over. According to Dr. Joseph Mercola, a health expert, the French see eating as an important part of their life style. They enjoy food and therefore spend a fairly long time at the table, while Americans see eating as something to be squeezed   between the other daily activities. Mercola believes Americans lose the ability to sense when they are actually full. So they keep eating long after the French would have stopped. In addition, he points out that Americans drive to huge supermarkets to buy canned and frozen foods for the week. The French, instead, tend to shop daily, walking to small shops and farmers' markets where they have a choice of fresh fruits, vegetables, and eggs as well as high-quality meats for each meal. After a visit to the United States, Mireille Guiliano, author of French Women Don't Get Fat, decided to write about the importance of knowing when to stop rather than suggesting how to avoid food. Today she continues to stay slim and rarely goes to the gym. In spite of all these differences, evidence shows that recent life style changes may be affecting French eating habits. Today the rate of obesity - or extreme overweight - among adults is only 6%.

When it was sold recently in New York for $ 27000, the seller, Mr. Oliver Pitt, was asked to explain how the picture had come into his possession. Pitt said, \"I didn't know it was so valuable. I'm not an art expert. Photography is my hobby. I bought 'Fisherman' in Italy in 1970 for $140.the picture was dirty, and I couldn't see the artist's signature. But anyway it wasn't the picture that I like. I bought it because of the frame.\" \"It's most unusual frame, made of tiny, silvery sea-shells. They are set in such a way that they reflect perfect light onto the surface of a picture. I now have a photograph of my wife in that frame, and I'll never part with it.\" \"When I returned to New York I showed the painting in its frame to a customs officer. I told him that I had paid $140 for it but admitted I didn't know its actual worth. The customs man valued it at $ 140, and I was asked to pay duty on that value. I did so, there and then.\" \"Later, I took off the frame, and that uncovered Maveleone's signature. My wife suggested in fun that the painting might be a valuable one, so I cleaned it and put it up for sale.\" As a result of his explanation, Oliver Pitt had to appear in court. He was accused of   knowingly making a false statement of the value of a picture so as to cheat the Customs Department. Pitt was not happy. \"I told the truth as I knew it then,\" he said, \"What else could I say?\" And then the judge agreed with him. \"The Customs Department is to be responsible (blame),\" he said, \"for making a true valuation of goods bought into the country, so that the correct amount of duty may be charged.

Recently it has drawn huge crowds attracted by athletes swimming 1,500m, cycling 40km, and then running 10km, without stopping. But what makes an attractive 17-year-old give up everything for the doubtful pleasures it offers? Melanie Sears has not yet learnt those often-repeated phrases about personal satisfaction, mental challenge and higher targets that most athletes use when asked similar questions. \"You swim for 1,500m, then run out of the water and jump on your bike, still wet. Of course, then you freeze. When the40kmcycle ride is over, you haveto run10km, which is a long way when you're feeling exhausted. But it's great fun, and all worth it in the end,\" she says. Melanie entered her first triathlon at 14 and she won the junior section. Full of confidence, she entered the National Championships, and although she had the second fastest swim and the fastest run, she came nowhere. \"I was following this man and suddenly we came to the sea. We realized then that we had gone wrong. I ended up cycling 20 kilometers too far. I cried all the way through the running.\" But she didn't give up. \"Sometimes I wish I could stop, because then the pain would be over, but I am afraid that if I let myself stop just once, I would be tempted to do it again.\" Such _ draws admiration from Steve Trew, the sport's director of coaching. Melanie was top junior in this year's European Triathlon Championships, finishing 13th.\"I was almost as good as the top three in swimming and running, but much slower in cycling.

Leonardo O'Grady, leader of the campaign, said, \"Happiness is contagious  . The Coca-Cola Hug Machine is a simple idea to spread some happiness. We want to spread happiness in an unexpected, creative way to attract not only the people present, but the audience at large.\" He hopes that it will encourage consumers to bring positivity, optimism and fun into their lives and to open a Coke, sharing a little happiness. The machines have been such a success that there are plans to roll them out across Asia. Mr. O'Grady added, \"The reaction was amazing -- at one point we had four to five people hugging the machine at the same time as well as each other! In fact, there was a long line of people looking to give hugs.\" The passage mainly tells us that   _  .", "subject": ""}

A rain garden  is not very different from a traditional garden. It is just a far more eco-friendly garden. Usually it is built lower than the ground. Rain gardens make smart use of rain and storm water by temporarily holding water from rain and storms and letting it soak slowly into the ground before it runs into streams or enters the public drinking water supply. Thus, a rain garden keeps the water, allowing it to be used as needed by plants in the rain garden, rather than flowing immediately into nearby streams and going unused. The water will soak slowly into the ground within a day or two. This creates an advantage that the rain garden does not allow mosquitoes to breed. This is a simple, attractive, and eco-friendly \"green\" way to treat storm water. What's more, planting a rain garden helps reduce pollution and improve the environment. Without using expensive machinery and chemicals, rain gardens remove harmful chemicals in the rainwater and cut down on the amount of pollution reaching streams and rivers by up to 30%.

The sound was so loud that other boaters heard it over the roar   of their engines. The teen boy who had been driving the motorboat stepped on the gas by mistake. Kaitlin, 23, had only small cuts, but Robby, 15, had been badly cut by the propeller  . And Lexi was floating facedown in the water. When one boater swam to Lexi, she was breathing.

Bush on them last week. But this was no carnival   - it was the Republican Party's National Convention  , which attracted thousands of protestors  . It was the largest protest ever at a US political convention, with at least 120,000 people marching through Manhattan on August 29. They demanded that the US leave Iraq and a new president be chosen. The Republicans say the opposition - Democrat Party   encouraged the people on to the streets. They believe it is a democratic move to help win presidential election, to be held on November 2. The election is described as \"the decisive battle between donkey and elephant\". The two animals are the symbols of the two major political parties in the US. The elephant represents   the Republicans, whose candidate  , President George W. Bush, is trying to defeat the donkey to win his second them. The donkey represents the democrats, whose candidate, John Kerry, is trying to kick the elephant out of the White House. Republicans think the elephant is powerful and clever, but the Democrats argue it is stupid and conservative  . In return, the Republicans regard the donkey as stubborn   and silly but the Democrats say it is humble, plain, smart and courageous. The Republicans have been sending emails to Bush supporters and journalists with the heading, \"An Elephant Never Forgets\", said party spokeswoman Heather Layman.

Because she couldn't give them one by one, Levine, then a sixth-grader, decided she would use her talents  to do the next best thing. She began to knit  hats, scarves, and blankets for families staying at the Ronald McDonald House at Stanford. Her creations also went to Bundle of Joy, a program that provides newborn baby items for families in need, and to Knitting Pals by the Bay, a local organization that provides hand-knitted caps to cancer patients. \"I love to knit, and I thought it would be a great idea to make all these handmade items for kids and adults who need them. It would be like a hug for them,\" Levine explained. Levine started the project about a year ago. \"I think it's just really fun to do, and it keeps me busy,\" said Levine, now 13. Once she got started, Levine realized that her project could be much bigger than the goods she was able to produce with just her own hands. So she sent emails to her school and communities , asking for knitted donations  to the project she named \"Hannah's Warm Hugs\". She also posted advertisements at Starbucks and other locations in her area. The warm goods began to _ . \"It was amazing; more strangers than people she knew started dropping donations at our door,\" said Levine's mother, Laura Levine. \"We ended up with this huge box of items she was donating.\" The knitted items numbered in the hundreds. Levine made her first round of donations around Hanukkah (an eight-day Jewish holiday in November or December) and later received thank-you letters from the organizations.

But tens of thousands of British high school students will soon be getting up later. They're taking part in a new experiment by Oxford University to see if later classes can improve their exam results. Grades 10 students in the UK have to take the nationwide General Certificate of Secondary Education (GCSE) exams. They have to pass these exams in order to study more advanced courses, and later apply for universities. The Oxford University project means that GCSE students from more than 100 schools across England will start school at 10 am, more than one hour later than the current start time (8:50 am). The project is based on scientific evidence that teenagers are \"out of sync \" with traditional school hours, the Telegraph reported. And what they need is more sleep in the morning. \"We know that something funny happens when you're a teenager, in that you seem to be out of sync with the world,\" said professor Colin Epsie, who is leading the study. \"Your parents think it's because you are lazy and opinionated and everything will be OK if you could get to sleep earlier.

{"answer": 3, "choices": ["123-45", "1234-5", "1-234-5", "1-2345"], "question": "Sharing not only exists between humanbeings.As is often seen that some plants and anima1s live close together, and they depend on each other. They are usually very different from their partner, and yet all live easier lives because of each other. It is nature's idea of sharing.  An example of a partnership is the shark and pilot fish. The pilot fish is a little fish only about nine inches long. He would be. helpless if he hung around by himself in the mighty ocean. He makes up for his size with his smartness. He cleverly swims along beside the shark. When the shark eats, the pilot fish gets the leftovers. And the pilot fish needn't worry about his safety. The shark also gets benefits from this relationship. The pilot fish cleans food scraps and insects from the shark's hide.  Another example of depending on each other is the sea anemone  and striped clown fish. The sea anemone looks like a flower and has petals  that contain poisonous stinging cells. When small fish swim into the petals, the anemone traps and paralyzes   them. However,the striped clown fish is able to swim into the poisonous petals without being harmed. When he is in danger, he quickly swims into the sea anemone and is unable to be seen by his enemies. To pay for his safety,the clown fish brings food to the anemone. He also guides other fish into the anemone's deadly trap.  Large mammals such as the ox, antelope, rhinoceroses and African buffalo form such a relationship with the red-billed ox-peeker. They provide daily meals for the bird. In fact the bird eats insects. The various large mammals act as a restaurant with a varied menu for the ox-peeker. What do they get in return from the bird? Free beauty treatments!  Some plants live together in a beneficial relationship of symbiosis. The fungus   does not have chlorophyll   that plants need to make food. However, green algae does contain chlorophyll. It is, therefore, able to feed the fungus along with itself. But nothing is free! The fungus repays it by protecting the algae.

Seeing her shabby appearance, the pastor guessed the reason, and, taking her by the hand, took her inside and found a place for her in the Sunday School class. The child was so touched that she went to bed that night thinking of the children who have no place to worship Jesus. Some years later, this child lay dead in one of the poor buildings and the parents called for the kindhearted pastor, who had befriended their daughter, to handle the final arrangements. As her poor little body was being moved, a worn purse was found which seemed to have been picked up from some trash dump. Inside was found 57 cents and a note scribbled in childish handwriting which read, \"This is to help build the little church bigger so more children can go to Sunday School.\" For two years she had saved for this offering of love. When the pastor tearfully read that note, he knew instantly what he would do. Carrying this note, he told people the story of her unselfish love and devotion. A newspaper learned of the story and published it. It was read by a Realtor who offered them a parcel of land worth many thousands. When told that the church could not pay so much, he offered it for 57 cents. Church members made large donations. Checks came from far and wide. Within five years the little girl's gift had increased to $250,000, a huge sum for that time.

{"answer": 1, "choices": ["Children need to discuss experiences with their parents.", "Why can't we remember the events of early childhood?", "Adults can't remember things as well as children.", "What are memories of early childhood like?"], "question": "What is your earliest childhood memory? Can you remember learning to walk? Or talk? The first time you watched a television program? Adults seldom call back events much earlier than the year or so before entering school, just as children younger than three or four seldom remember any specific, personal experiences. A variety of explanations have been suggested by psychologists   for this \"childhood amnesia\". Now Annette Simms, a psychologist of Riverdale University, offers a new explanation for childhood amnesia. According to Dr. Simms, children need to learn to use someone else's spoken description of their personal experiences in order to turn their own short-term, fast forgotten impressions of them into long-term memories. In other words, children have to talk about their experiences and hear others talk about them. Without this verbal reinforcement  , children cannot form permanent memories of what they have experienced. So why should personal memories depend so heavily on hearing them described? Dr. Simms presents evidence that the human mind organizes memories in that way. Children whose mothers talk with them about the day's activities before bedtime tend to remember more of the day's special event than those whose mothers don't. Talking about an event in this way helps a child to remember it. And learning to organize memories as a continuous story is the key to a permanent mental \"autobiography  \" of important life events. Dr. Simms suggests that we humans may be biologically programmed to turn our life experiences into a novel. The key to creating this mental life story is language, says Dr. Simms. \"Children learn to talk about the past,\" she says. \"Talking to others about their short-term memories of the past leads to the establishment   of long-term memories.\" One way it does this is by helping a child to recognize that the retelling of an experience is just the experience itself, recreated in the form of words. The child learns that this \"word-description\" of an experience can then be stored in the memory and called back at any time. But a child's language skills are usually not ready for this until the age of three or four, so they have no way to remember the earliest of their experiences.

Over the years, Buddy seldom saw either of his parents. But he was happy where he was and he had many kindly  s, among whom Miss Sook was by far his best friend. Before Christmas, Buddy's father had managed to get legal custody  of him for this Christmas. So, he had a new suit, with a card pinned with his name and address and made the trip alone, by bus, to New Orleans. Several things occurred that kept me awake the whole night. First, the footfalls, the noise of my father running up and down the stairs, breathing heavily, I had to see what he was up to. So I hid and watched. There was a Christmas tree and the fireplace downstairs. Moreover, I could see my father. He was crawling around under the tree arranging a pyramid of packages. I felt dizzy, for what I saw forced me to reconsider everything. If these were presents intended for me, then obviously they had not been ordered by the Lord and delivered by Santa Claus; no, they were gifts bought and wrapped by my father. Which meant that my rotten little cousin Billy Bob and other rotten kids like him weren't lying when they laughed at me and told me there was no Santa Claus. The worst thought was: Had Sook known the truth, and lied to me? No, Sook would never lie to me. She believed. It was just that--well, though she was sixty-something, in some ways she was at least as much of a child as I was. I waited until I was sure he was in bed and sound asleep. Then I crept downstairs and examined the tags attached to each of the packages. They all said: \"For Buddy.\" I decided to open the packages: It was Christmas morning. I was awake, so why not? I won't bother to describe what was inside them: just shirts and sweaters and dull stuff like that. The only thing I appreciated was a toy gun. Somehow I got the idea it would be fun to waken my father by firing it. So I did. Bang. Bang. Bang. He raced out of his room, wild-eyed, Bang. Bang. Bang. \"Buddy--what the hell do you think you're doing? Bang. Bang. Bang. \"Stop that!\" I laughed. \" Look, Daddy. Look at all wonderful things Santa Claus brought me.\" Calm now, he walked into the room and hugged me. \"You like what Santa Claus brought you?\" I smiled at him. He smiled at me. There was a tender lingering  moment, damaged when I said: \"Yes. But what are you going to give me, Daddy?\" His smile evaporated. His eyes narrowed suspiciously--you could see that he thought I was pulling some kind of trick. But then he blushed, as though he was ashamed to be thinking what he was thinking. He patted my head, and coughed and said: \"Well, I thought I'd wait and let you pick out something you wanted. Is there anything particular you want?\" I reminded him of the airplane we had seen in the toy store on Canal Street. His face sagged. Oh, yes, he remembered the airplane and how expensive it was. Nevertheless, the next day I was sitting in that airplane dreaming I was zooming toward heaven while my father wrote out a check for a happy salesman, who promised to help ship the plane on the bus.  But I wasn't free of New Orleans yet. The problem was a large bottle of wine; maybe it was because of my departure, but anyway my father had been drinking it all day, and on the way to the bus station, he scared me by grabbing my wrist and harshly whispering: \"I'm not going to let you go. I can't let you go back to that crazy family in that crazy old house. Just look at what they've done to you. A boy six, almost seven, talking about Santa Claus! It's all their fault, all those sour old spinsters with their Bibles and their knitting needles, those drunken uncles. Listen to me, Buddy. There is no God! There is no Santa Claus.\" He was squeezing my wrist so hard that it ached. \"Kiss me. Please. Please. Kiss me. Tell your daddy that you love him.\" But I couldn't speak. I was terrified I was going to miss my bus. And I was worried about my plane, which was strapped to the top of the taxi. \"Say it: 'I love you.' Say it. Please. Buddy. Say it.\" It was lucky for me that our taxi-driver was a good-hearted man. Because if it hadn't been for his help, and the help of some efficient porters and a friendly policeman, I don't know what would have happened when we reached the station. My father was so drunk he could hardly walk, but the policeman talked to him, quieted him down, helped him to stand straight, and the taxi-man promised to take him safely home. But my father would not leave until he had seen the porters put me on the bus. Once I was on the bus, I crouched in a seat and shut my eyes. I felt the strangest pain. A crushing pain that hurt everywhere. I thought if I took off my heavy city shoes, those crucifying monsters, the agony would ease. I took them off, but the mysterious pain did not leave me. In a way it never has; never will. Twelve hours later I was home in bed. The room was dark. Sook was sitting beside me, rocking in a rocking chair, a sound as soothing as ocean waves. I had tried to tell her everything that had happened, and only stopped when I was hoarse as a howling dog. She stroked her fingers through my hair, and said: \"Of course there is a Santa Clause. It's just that no single somebody could do all he has to do. So the Lord has spread the task among us all. That's why everybody is Santa Claus. I am. You are. Even you cousin Billy Bob.

And the next day I did it. I went with Sook to the post office and bought a penny postcard. That same postcard exists today. It was found in my father's safety deposit box when he died last year. Here is what I had written him: Hello pop hope you are well I am and I am turning to pedal my plane so fast I will soon be in the sky so keep your eyes open and yes I love you Buddy.

{"answer": 2, "choices": ["old", "clever", "naughty", "trusted"], "question": "Parents divorced, little Buddy was in the care of his mother's large Alabama family. Over the years, Buddy seldom saw either of his parents. But he was happy where he was and he had many kindly  s, among whom Miss Sook was by far his best friend. Before Christmas, Buddy's father had managed to get legal custody  of him for this Christmas. So, he had a new suit, with a card pinned with his name and address and made the trip alone, by bus, to New Orleans. Several things occurred that kept me awake the whole night. First, the footfalls, the noise of my father running up and down the stairs, breathing heavily, I had to see what he was up to. So I hid and watched. There was a Christmas tree and the fireplace downstairs. Moreover, I could see my father. He was crawling around under the tree arranging a pyramid of packages. I felt dizzy, for what I saw forced me to reconsider everything. If these were presents intended for me, then obviously they had not been ordered by the Lord and delivered by Santa Claus; no, they were gifts bought and wrapped by my father. Which meant that my rotten little cousin Billy Bob and other rotten kids like him weren't lying when they laughed at me and told me there was no Santa Claus. The worst thought was: Had Sook known the truth, and lied to me? No, Sook would never lie to me. She believed. It was just that--well, though she was sixty-something, in some ways she was at least as much of a child as I was. I waited until I was sure he was in bed and sound asleep. Then I crept downstairs and examined the tags attached to each of the packages. They all said: \"For Buddy.\" I decided to open the packages: It was Christmas morning. I was awake, so why not? I won't bother to describe what was inside them: just shirts and sweaters and dull stuff like that. The only thing I appreciated was a toy gun. Somehow I got the idea it would be fun to waken my father by firing it. So I did. Bang. Bang. Bang. He raced out of his room, wild-eyed, Bang. Bang. Bang. \"Buddy--what the hell do you think you're doing? Bang. Bang. Bang. \"Stop that!\" I laughed. \" Look, Daddy. Look at all wonderful things Santa Claus brought me.\" Calm now, he walked into the room and hugged me. \"You like what Santa Claus brought you?\" I smiled at him. He smiled at me. There was a tender lingering  moment, damaged when I said: \"Yes. But what are you going to give me, Daddy?\" His smile evaporated. His eyes narrowed suspiciously--you could see that he thought I was pulling some kind of trick. But then he blushed, as though he was ashamed to be thinking what he was thinking. He patted my head, and coughed and said: \"Well, I thought I'd wait and let you pick out something you wanted. Is there anything particular you want?\" I reminded him of the airplane we had seen in the toy store on Canal Street. His face sagged. Oh, yes, he remembered the airplane and how expensive it was. Nevertheless, the next day I was sitting in that airplane dreaming I was zooming toward heaven while my father wrote out a check for a happy salesman, who promised to help ship the plane on the bus.  But I wasn't free of New Orleans yet. The problem was a large bottle of wine; maybe it was because of my departure, but anyway my father had been drinking it all day, and on the way to the bus station, he scared me by grabbing my wrist and harshly whispering: \"I'm not going to let you go. I can't let you go back to that crazy family in that crazy old house. Just look at what they've done to you. A boy six, almost seven, talking about Santa Claus! It's all their fault, all those sour old spinsters with their Bibles and their knitting needles, those drunken uncles. Listen to me, Buddy. There is no God! There is no Santa Claus.\" He was squeezing my wrist so hard that it ached. \"Kiss me. Please. Please. Kiss me. Tell your daddy that you love him.\" But I couldn't speak. I was terrified I was going to miss my bus. And I was worried about my plane, which was strapped to the top of the taxi. \"Say it: 'I love you.' Say it. Please. Buddy. Say it.\" It was lucky for me that our taxi-driver was a good-hearted man. Because if it hadn't been for his help, and the help of some efficient porters and a friendly policeman, I don't know what would have happened when we reached the station. My father was so drunk he could hardly walk, but the policeman talked to him, quieted him down, helped him to stand straight, and the taxi-man promised to take him safely home. But my father would not leave until he had seen the porters put me on the bus. Once I was on the bus, I crouched in a seat and shut my eyes. I felt the strangest pain. A crushing pain that hurt everywhere. I thought if I took off my heavy city shoes, those crucifying monsters, the agony would ease. I took them off, but the mysterious pain did not leave me. In a way it never has; never will. Twelve hours later I was home in bed. The room was dark. Sook was sitting beside me, rocking in a rocking chair, a sound as soothing as ocean waves. I had tried to tell her everything that had happened, and only stopped when I was hoarse as a howling dog. She stroked her fingers through my hair, and said: \"Of course there is a Santa Clause. It's just that no single somebody could do all he has to do. So the Lord has spread the task among us all. That's why everybody is Santa Claus. I am. You are. Even you cousin Billy Bob.

The length of the workday, for many workers, is defined by time. They leave when the clock tells them they're done. These days, the time is everywhere: not just on clocks or watches, but on cell-phones and computers. That may be a bad thing, particularly at work. New research shows that clock-based work schedules hinder morale and creativity. Clock-timers organize their day by blocks of minutes and hours. For example: a meeting from 9 am to 10 a.m., research from 10 a.m. to noon, etc. On the other hand, task-timers have a list of things they want to accomplish.

The days are long gone of the man going trembling to the girl's father and saying, \"Sir, may I have the honor of having the hand of your daughter in marriage?\" However, a wise couple always discusses their plans for marriage with their respective families, and a young man often suggests a \"financial talk\" with his future father-in-law before the latter is faced with the embarrassment of asking for  _ . Even if a young woman has supported herself and lives away from home, her parents have the right to know how her fiance proposes to handle the long-range financing of their family and home. The fiance should state his income, his savings, and his future expectations, without overstating any of them. Engagement parties are given by the parents of the bride-to-be or by a   of the bride acting for her parents, usually just before the newspaper announcement of the engagement. If the bride-to-be and her fiance live in a city other than her parents, it is better for her parents to go to the city than her to go home to them for the engagement party. She and her fiance will, after all, be partied in her parents' hometown during the wedding festivities. However, if the family home is not far away, it is proper for the engaged couple to travel there for the announcement party. The young man's family should be invited, too. If the bride's parents are no longer living, then a   or a close friend can give the party. It is usually a simple cocktail's party, champagne served for toasts to the engaged couple. If the party is very large, the engaged couple and the girl's parents might form a receiving line -- but they do not have to. The bride-to-be usually wears her engagement ring officially for the first time on this occasion. If she has a gift for the groom-to-be, she gives it to him right before or after the engagement party. For Americans, the traditional engagement ring is a diamond solitaire  . However, today anything goes -- a ring with many color1ed stones, a ring with a large semi-precious stone, an heirloom   ring reset in a modern design, or even a stone in the bride's family, simply reset in a Tiffany setting. The wedding ring will be of the same metal as the engagement ring. Some girls prefer no engagement ring but choose a wedding band that is decorated with stones instead. No one has to have an engagement ring. A girl may want her fiance to give her a pearl necklace instead, or a jeweled watch. Jeweled rings can be given as gifts on many occasions during the married lives -- such as wedding anniversaries, the birth of a child, or an important job promotion.

It was filmed in 1942, during the Second World War, and starred Humphrey Bogart as Rick, and Ingrid Bergman as Ilsa. The movie is set in Casablanca, a place the Germans hope to take from the French. Rick owns a bar there.     In the movie, the German army is coming towardsCasablanca. People who live there are trying to escape before they arrive. Rick has two tickets for the last plane out ofCasablanca. His former lover Ilsa arrives inCasablancawith her husband Victor Lazlo. Lazlo is a leader in a secret group, and his escape will help win the war againstGermany. Rick decides to give his tickets to Ilsa and Lazlo rather than use them himself. Rick really loves Ilsa, but he knows that it is more important for Lazlo to get out ofCasablanca. Rick is a very tough character but he is not selfish. He is very good to people who need his help.     Some famous lines from the movie are, \"Here's looking at you, kid.\" and  \"This could be the beginning of a beautiful friendship.\" Many people think that the line,  \"Play it again, Sam.\" is in the movie. Actually, the line is \"Play it, Sam.\"  Both Rick and Ilsa ask the piano player, Sam, to play the song,As Time Goes By.

{"answer": 0, "choices": ["The scientists are satisfied with the result of the experiment.", "Ross is a kidney expert who is involved in the experiment.", "The function of the renewed kidney is the same as a healthy kidney.", "The renewed kidney produced a great deal of urine."], "question": "Scientists at Harvard University have recycled a kidney(')-in a rat. The researchers removed a kidney from a dead rat. Later, the renewed kidney was put into a living rat. It wasn't perfect. It did, however, show signs of working like a kidney should. \"It's really beautiful work,\" Edward Ross, a kidney researcher at the University of Florida in Gainesville, told Science News. He didn't work on the new study. Kidneys are bean-shaped and act like guards in the body. They clean the blood by removing waste and extra water. Every day, an adult's kidneys filter  enough blood to fill a bathtub half full. Along the way, they produce eight cups of urine  from that waste and water. When a person's kidneys fail, all of that waste stays in the body. Such patients can quickly become very sick and die, unless they are regularly connected to a machine that filters their blood. At any given time, about 100,000 people in the United States are waiting for a replacement kidney. But healthy donated kidneys are difficult to get. Either a living person must donate one, or a kidney must be removed from someone who just died and earlier had agreed to the donation. In either case, people receiving new kidneys face the risk that their bodies will reject the donated ones. But there may be another option.  Researchers use knowledge of living things to grow or improve tissue that can aid human health. Harald Ott's team at Harvard started with a \"used\" kidney. Scientists added kidney cells from rats and blood vessel cells from people to the matrix . These cells attached themselves and began to multiply. Before long, they formed new kidney tissue. The scientists placed this renewed kidney into another rat. There it produced a small amount of urine. This experiment shows that the lab-grown kidney can do at least some of the work performed by a healthy kidney. The results are a promising first step toward helping people with serious kidney problems. \"This is still very early, but they've come a long way,\" Ross said.

They usually start with a sheet of metal, wood or other material and cut, drill   and shave it to create a desired shape. Sometimes, they use a mold   made of metal or sand, pour liquid plastic or metal into it and let it cool to create a solid part. Now, a completely different method is gaining popularity. On Oct. 9, 2013, London Science Museum kicked off its new exhibition, 3-D: Printing the Future, with over 600 3-D printed objects on display, including space probes  , toy dolls and even human organs - basically any product you can think of, reported Live Science. You might find it hard to believe that an object can actually be \"printed out\" like a picture. But it is not that hard to understand how it works. Just as a traditional printer sprays   ink onto paper line by line, modern 3-D printers spread material onto a surface layer by layer, from the bottom to the top, gradually building up a shape. Instead of ink, the materials the 3-D printer uses are mainly plastic, resin   and certain metals.

However, scientists who study the brain have learned many interesting things from studying the brains of daydreamers. Far from being a waste of time, recent research has shown that daydreaming is a healthy and useful activity for all of our brains. To study the brain, scientists use special devices that scan the brain and show pictures of which parts of the brain are active at certain times. When a person is daydreaming, the device will show a distinct pattern of activity in the brain called the \"default\" mode of thinking. In the default mode, the top or outside part of the brain is very active. Actually, several regions of the brain are interacting in this mode. Some scientists describe this mode as a time when the brain focuses on itself rather than focusing on the environment around the person. Typically, this occurs when a person is doing simple, undemanding work or performing routine actions that don't need much attention, like walking to school or cooking simple foods. People tend to daydream during such activities. The importance of daydreaming lies in developing both creative and social skills. When the mind is not engaged in dealing with one's immediate situation or problem, then it is free to wander. A time of wandering allows the mind to create things. New inventions may be imagined, or possible solutions to a problem can be planned. For example, solutions to problems in relationships with other people may spring to mind. In fact, most daydreams involve situations with others. Perhaps these are daydreams based on past memories, or daydreams of what might be in the future. In either case, daydreams help us develop the appropriate skills we can use in real interactions with others. As brain specialist Dr. Marcus Raichle of Washington University explains: \"When you don't use a muscle, that muscle really isn't doing much. But when your brain is supposedly doing nothing and daydreaming, it's really doing a great amount.\" During the so-called \"resting state\" the brain isn't resting at all!

However, scientists who study the brain have learned many interesting things from studying the brains of daydreamers. Far from being a waste of time, recent research has shown that daydreaming is a healthy and useful activity for all of our brains. To study the brain, scientists use special devices that scan the brain and show pictures of which parts of the brain are active at certain times. When a person is daydreaming, the device will show a distinct pattern of activity in the brain called the \"default\" mode of thinking. In the default mode, the top or outside part of the brain is very active. Actually, several regions of the brain are interacting in this mode. Some scientists describe this mode as a time when the brain focuses on itself rather than focusing on the environment around the person. Typically, this occurs when a person is doing simple, undemanding work or performing routine actions that don't need much attention, like walking to school or cooking simple foods. People tend to daydream during such activities. The importance of daydreaming lies in developing both creative and social skills. When the mind is not engaged in dealing with one's immediate situation or problem, then it is free to wander. A time of wandering allows the mind to create things. New inventions may be imagined, or possible solutions to a problem can be planned. For example, solutions to problems in relationships with other people may spring to mind. In fact, most daydreams involve situations with others. Perhaps these are daydreams based on past memories, or daydreams of what might be in the future. In either case, daydreams help us develop the appropriate skills we can use in real interactions with others. As brain specialist Dr. Marcus Raichle of Washington University explains: \"When you don't use a muscle, that muscle really isn't doing much. But when your brain is supposedly doing nothing and daydreaming, it's really doing a great amount.\" During the so-called \"resting state\" the brain isn't resting at all!

He said this will happen as the technology is improved. ks5u According to Richard Mason, what is the biggest challenge for driverless cars?", "subject": ""}

When people walk into a Pizza Hut in Tokyo, Rome, or Miami, they know exactly what they are getting. Through franchising, an investor   can make use of this brand power by opening a Pizza Hut of his or her own. The risk is low, and the rewards can be big. No wonder franchising is such a successful business model. Franchising had been around for more than 100 years, but its popularity took off in the 1950s. Leading the trend were fast food restaurant like McDonald's. These days, there are franchises in more than eighty-five industries, including dry cleaning, hotels and supermarkets. It's a very big business. In the US, there are some 760,000 franchises, totaling more than $1.5 trillion in yearly revenues (income). There are two sides in a franchise: the franchisor--the owner of the business system and the franchisee--the person who licenses the system. After signing a \"franchise agreement\", the franchisee pays a fee. He or she also pays for equipment, supplies, and, if necessary, building costs. The total investment usually ranges from $10,000 to $1,000,000. After the business opens, the franchisee also pays a percentage of sales revenues--called a royalty--to the franchisor.

Data on diet among 3,500 middle-aged civil servants were compared with their emotional state five years later, a British journal reported. They split the participants into two types of diet--those who ate a diet largely based on whole food,which includes lots of fruit, vegetables and fish,and those who ate a mainly processed food diet, such as sweetened desserts, fried food, processed meat,refined  grains and high fat dairy products After accounting for factors such as gender, age, education, physical activity, smoking habits and chronic  diseases, they found a significant difference in the future depression risk with the different diets. Those who ate the most wholefood  had a 26% lower risk of future depression than those who ate the least wholefood. By contrast, people with a diet high in processed food had a 58% higher risk of depression than those who ate a diet low in processed foods. Study author Dr. Archana Singh Manoux pointed out there was a chance that the finding could be explained by lifestyle factor they had not accounted for.

They split the participants into two types of diet--those who ate a diet largely based on whole food,which includes lots of fruit, vegetables and fish,and those who ate a mainly processed food diet, such as sweetened desserts, fried food, processed meat,refined  grains and high fat dairy products After accounting for factors such as gender, age, education, physical activity, smoking habits and chronic  diseases, they found a significant difference in the future depression risk with the different diets. Those who ate the most wholefood  had a 26% lower risk of future depression than those who ate the least wholefood. By contrast, people with a diet high in processed food had a 58% higher risk of depression than those who ate a diet low in processed foods. Study author Dr. Archana Singh Manoux pointed out there was a chance that the finding could be explained by lifestyle factor they had not accounted for.  He also pointed in a paper that a Mediterranean  diet was associated  with a lower risk of depression, but the problem with that is if you live in Britain, the likelihood  of you eating a Mediterranean diet is not very high. Dr.Andrew McCulloeh, chief executive of the Mental Health Foundation, said, this study adds to an existing body of solid research that shows the strong links between what we eat and our mental health.

His request came after a class trip, when he saw one boy's baggy trousers slide to his feet. He pointed out that this way of dressing is not suitable for school. But in Italy, a nation that takes fashion very seriously, the suggestion caused a debate among parents, teachers and students. The issue is whether the headmaster's request will limit students' freedom-- or whether dress in Italian schools is too casual. A parents' group praised the move in favor of good taste, while others advised schools to stop worrying about fashion and fix up old school buildings. \"We do not want to kick fashion out,\" the headmaster explained, \"but extremes of fashion like this are not right in school.\" Many other schools have now requested that their students also stop wearing such trousers.

When a person does a certain thing again, he is impelled(,)  by some unseen force to do the same thing repeatedly; thus a habit is formed. Once a habit is formed, it is difficult, and sometimes impossible, to get rid of. It is therefore very important that we should pay great attention to the formation   of habits. Children often form bad habits, some of which remain with them as long as they live. Older persons also form bad habits as long as they live, and sometimes become ruined by them.. There are other habits which, when formed in early life, are of great help. Many successful men say that much of their success has something to do with certain habits in early life, such as early rising, honesty and thoroughness . Among the habits which children should not form are laziness, lying, stealing and so on. These are all easily formed habits. Unfortunately older persons form habits which ought to have been avoided.

As a result, many sharks are caught and killed. In Palau, where more than half of tourists are drawn by diving excursions, each reef shark brings in about $179,000 in tourism revenue annually, or about $1.9 million during its lifetime. Due to overexploitation and lack of proper management, many shark species are under considerable risk of unrecoverable decline with some species having declined to near extinction in recent years. According to reports, sharks are being killed at an alarming rate of up to 273 million worldwide per year. Some experts predict that if the killing continues at the current rate many shark species will be lost forever. It can be very dangerous. Sharks are very important and they should be protected. In a study of the east coast of the United States, 11 species of sharks were eliminated from their range. Of the 14 species of ocean life that those sharks used to eat, the populations of 12 exploded and caused great damage to the ecosystem. For example, the cownose ray   population was no longer kept under control by sharks and so grew out of control. As a result, the rays destroyed the population of bay scallops  , their favorite food. The scallop fishery, which had been in good condition for over 100 years, was wiped out. Also, the removal of the scallops most likely had an effect on water quality as they were no longer there to perform their function of cleaning the water. Sharks play a vital role in the oceans in a way that the average fish does not. Most sharks serve as top predators at the pinnacle of the marine food pyramid, and so play a critical role in ocean ecosystems. Directly or indirectly they regulate the natural balance of these ecosystems. Sharks tend to eat very efficiently, going after the old, sick, or slower fish in a population, keeping that population healthy. Sharks help keep many populations of ocean life to the right size so that those prey   species don't cause harm to the ecosystem by becoming too populated. The ocean ecosystem is made up of very complex food webs. For the most part, sharks are at the top of these webs and are considered by scientists to be\"keystone\"species, meaning that removing them may cause the whole structure to fall apart, including key fisheries such as tuna and other important fish species that maintain the health of coral reefs. Therefore, we should protect sharks because doing so is to protect the whole ecosystem. What's the main reason for killing sharks in Asia?", "subject": ""}

{"answer": 2, "choices": ["Once poor, always poor?", "Why are poor people poorer?", "Poverty weakens brain power.", "Different experiments, different findings."], "question": "New research finds a link between poverty and poor decision making. The findings may explain why poor people sometimes make bad choices that continue their hardship.      Earlier studies have found the poor less likely to escape poverty. But there has been little research on why the poor make decisions that make their lives harder. Until recently, it was economists who studied poverty, not psychologists. Eldar Shafir, a psychologist in Princeton University says now scientists from both fields work together. Mr. Shafir and his team did two experiments. One took place at a shopping center in New Jersey.  Another was carried out among sugar cane farmers in rural India.       The New Jersey experiment involved individuals with low paying jobs and others belonged to the middle class. All the volunteers were asked what they would do if their cars needed repairs.      The volunteers were given two imaginary situations. In the first, the car repairs cost $ 150.  In the second,  $ 1,500.      \"And what we found is that the poor and the rich performed equally well on almost all the tests. \"       Not so when the researchers raised the repair costs to $ 1,500.      \"Now the poor performed significantly worse. \" The poorer lost about 13 IQ points on average. This is about the loss experienced when a person has not slept for one night.      The scientists then wondered if the same person reacted differently when he was rich and when he was poor.

The music makes us constantly aware of the sea's immensity, it's potential for threat, and the play of light on its waves. But the sea isn't just a special background, it weighs on the lives of the characters, offering them a living, but at a price. In the first act the laboured sound of the strings evokes   the complete heaviness of the sailor's work, as they haul  the boats up the shingle  . Then a storm gathers which rages  through the scene at the Inn, and stirs up an orchestral hurricane. Even when it's calm and favorable, the sea is inescapable. In the comfortable enclosed world of the opera house, this can only be suggested. In the production of Peter Grimes about to open at the Aldeburgh Festival, it will be really present, because the opera is taking place on the beach, the setting for much of the narrative of Britten's opera, and also the poem by the Suffolk poet George Crabbe that inspired it. This won't be the first opera production to be set in the actual landscape in which the action takes place. There's a well-known filmed production of Tosca shot in Castel Gandolfo in Rome, and a production of Donizetti's Anna Bolena was once mounted in the moat  surrounding the Tower of London. But those were manageable urban landscapes, with comfortingly solid buildings to act as wind shields and acoustic blocks. On the Aldeburgh beach there's actually nothing, apart from a few boats, some whole, some wrecked. Here anything more complicated than walking the dog is hard to solve. The wind blows away one's words, so conversation is hard, and anything not tied down tends to blow away. The sliding shingle turns one's steps into a drunken stagger. The idea of performing an opera in these conditions seems quite _ -- an accusation Aldeburgh director Jonathan Reakie takes cheerfully on the chin. Why has he done it? \"Well, Grimes is the opera of Britten's that's most associated with Aldeburgh, but it's never been produced at the Festival which he founded. There just isn't the space for it. In his anniversary year we wanted to focus on Britten's connection with Suffolk, and this seemed the boldest way to do it.\" Having had the mad idea, Reakie found his colleagues were not just accepting, but enthusiastic. \"We spent a long time thinking about ways to do it. One idea we had was to do all the scenes at the right time of day. There's one scene at dawn, another at midday, and a lot of action at night, but that was too complicated.

{"answer": 1, "choices": ["Soccer and golf.", "Skiing and skating.", "Cycling and hockey.", "Mountaineering."], "question": "Most young people enjoy some forms of physical activity. It may be walking, cycling, swimming, or in winter, skating or skiing. It may be a game of some forms--football, basketball, hockey, golf or tennis. It may be mountaineering. Those who have a _ for climbing high and difficult mountains are often looked upon with astonishment. Why are men and women willing to suffer cold and hardship, and to take risks in high mountains? This astonishment is caused, probably, by the difference between mountaineering and other forms of activity to which men give their leisure. Mountaineering is a sport and not a game. There are no man-made rules, as others, as there are for such games as golf and football. There are, of course, rules of different kinds which would be dangerous to ignore, but it is this freedom from man-made rules that makes mountaineering attractive to many people. Those who climb mountains are free to use their own methods. If we compare mountaineering with other more familiar sports, we might think that one big difference is that mountaineering is not a \"team game\". We should be mistaken in this. There are, it is true, no \"matches\" between \"teams\" of climbers, but when climbers are on a rock face linked by a rope on which their lives may depend, there is obviously teamwork.

Why do business institutions still possess this great prestige? One reason is that Americans view business as being more firmly based on the idea of competition than other organizations in society. Since competition is seen as the main source of progress and development by most Americans, competitive business organizations are respected. Competition is not only good in itself; it is the means by which other basic American values, such as individual freedom, equality of opportunity, and hard work are protected. Competition protects the individual freedom by making sure that there is no monopoly   of power. Compared with one and all-powerful government, many businesses compete against each other for benefit. If one business tries to take unfair advantage of its customers, it will lose to the competing business which treats its customers more fairly. Since there are many businesses competing for the customers' dollars, they cannot afford to treat them unfairly and the customers would lose nothing.A contrast is often made between business, which is competitive, and government, which is a monopoly. Because business is competitive, many Americans believe that it gives more support for freedom than government, even though government leaders are elected by the people while business leaders are not. Many Americans believe that competition is as important, or even more important, as democracy in protecting freedom. Competition in business is also believed to strengthen the idea of equal opportunities. Competition is seen as an open and fair race where success goes to any person regardless of his or her social class background. Competitive success is commonly seen as the American choice of the higher social position which is not based on one's family background.

It must have nooks and crannies, corners and snugs, where conversations and assignations can take place without the whole world listening in. Most pubs have at least two separate bars. The \"public bar\" which is for ordinary and women is the basic drinking shop. The \"lounge bar\" (or saloon bar) which is for traveling salesmen and \"ladies\" probably has a carpet on the floor and rather more comfortable decoration. There may be a difference of a few pence in the drink prices, although all pubs are required by law to put their price lists easily seen on display. Pubs have been changing over the past few decades. More and more of them sell good, inexpensive food and are competing strongly with restaurants. Tea and coffee are often on offer and children are being made more welcome.

The pilot's voice was heard throughout the plane: \"Sorry for the delay, ladies and gentlemen. Our engines don't work. We are going to jump-start them. Once we get them going, we'll get up in the air and see what happens.\" That was all he said. \"See what happens?\" Shouldn't we have had a better plan than that? At that point. I could only laugh nervously. One woman started crying, \"Oh no! We are going to crash!'' There were sighs of hopelessness and anxiety, and we hadn't even taken off yet. The pilot even seemed unhappy. He told us our one engine was working double time, and his plan was to get up in the air and see what happens! Then we did. We got up in the air, and what happened?

One of their chief duties is to give their children a sense of personal worth, for self-esteem is the basis of a good mental health. A youngster who is often made to feel stupid, often compared to brighter brothers, sisters, or cousins, will not feel confident and become so afraid of failing, that he (or she) won't try at all. Of course, they should be corrected when they do wrong; this is the way children learn. But the criticisms should be balanced with praises.     Parents owe their children firm guidance and consistent discipline. It is frightening for a youngster to feel that he is in charge of himself; it's like being in a car without brakes. The parent who says \"Yes\" sends a double message. He is also saying \"I love you, and I am ready to risk your anger, because I don't want you to get in trouble.\"     Parents owe their children a comfortable feeling about their body, and enough information about sex to balance the wrong information that they will surely receive from their friends.     Parents owe their children privacy and respect for their personal things. This means not borrowing things without being permitted, not reading diaries and mail, not looking through pockets. If a mother feels that she must read her daughter's dairies to know what is gong on, the communication between them must be pretty bad.     Parents owe their children a set of solid values around which to build their lives. This means teaching them to respect the rights and opinions of others; it means respecting elders, teachers, and the law. The best way to teach such values is by example.

{"answer": 1, "choices": ["It only traps the heat of the sun.", "It makes the earth neither too hot nor too cold.", "It works the same way as greenhouse gases.", "It prevents all the light from the sun shining on the earth."], "question": "Global warming is when the earth heats up, the temperature rises. It happens when greenhouse gases ---carbon dioxide, water vapor, nitrous oxide , and methane  trap heat and light from the sun in the earth's atmosphere, which increases the temperature. This is like when heat is trapped in a car. On a very hot day, the car gets hotter when it is out in the parking lot. This is because the heat and light from the sun can get into the car, by going through the windows, but it can't get back out. Once the light is inside the car, it is trapped and the heat builds up, just like it does in the earth's atmosphere. This is what the greenhouse effect does to the earth. The heat and light can get through the atmosphere, but it can't get out. As a result, the temperature rises.    Sometimes the temperature can change in a way that helps us. The greenhouse effect makes the earth appropriate for people to live on. Without it, the earth would be freezing, or on the other hand it would be burning hot. We would not get the sun's heat and light to make the night somewhat warm. During the day, especially during the summer, it would be burning because the sun would be up with no atmosphere to filter  it, so people, plants, and animals would be exposed to all the light and heat.   Although the greenhouse effect makes the earth able to have people living on it, if there gets to be too many gases, the earth can get unusually warmer, and many plants, animals, and people will die. They would die because there would be less food(plants like corn, wheat, and other vegetables and fruits). This would happen because the plants would not be able to take in the heat. This would cause us to have less food to eat, but it would also limit the food that animals have. Gradually, people, plants, and animals would all die of hunger.    People are doing many things to try stop global warming. One thing people are doing is carpooling. Carpooling is driving with someone to a place that you are both going to. This minimizes the amount of greenhouse gases put into the air by a car. Another thing that people are doing is being more careful about leaving things turned on like the television, computer, and the lights. A lot of people are taking time away from the television, and instead, they are spending more time outdoors. This helps our planet out a lot. Now, more people are even riding buses, walking to school, and riding their bikes to lower the amount of greenhouse gases in the air.    Planting trees and recycling also help. If you recycle, less trash goes to the dump, and less trash gets burned. As a result, there are fewer greenhouse gases in our atmosphere. Although adults do many things to help stop global warming, kids can do just as much. What is the effect of atmosphere?", "subject": ""}

{"answer": 1, "choices": ["Ethanol products are known to cause cancer.", "Ethanol can remove some harmful pollutants from gas.", "The production of ethanol is protected by law.", "Ethanol-fueled automobiles are cheaper than gas-fueled ones."], "question": "Many Americans concerned about pollution are demanding cleaner supplies of energy. The demand has resulted in increased research about ethanol fuel. Ethanol is an alcohol that can be mixed with gas. It burns up most of the pollutants in gas. It replaces some of the chemicals that are known to cause cancer, and it can be produced in the United States. Some experts say that in the future ethanol will replace some of the oil imported into America. Today ethanol is less than one percent of total American fuel supply. The head of the National Corn Growers Association, Kieve Hard, says ethanol will provide twenty-five percent of the fuel supply by 2030. The organization is involved in the production of ethanol because it can be made from corn. One company in the American Midwest says it is starting to produce ethanol because of demands from people and from the government. The Congress approved the Clean Air Act in 1990. The company says this means the market for ethanol will expand. The company is a major producer of corn starch that can be used to make ethanol. At Texas A and M University Professor Mark Holzapple produces ethanol from materials found in solid waste. He has developed a way to turn materials like paper into simple sugar. He then uses yeast to turn the sugar into ethanol. Professor Holzapple says two hundred liters of ethanol fuel can be produced from one ton of solid waste. A professor at the University of Arkansas, John Geddie, is exploring another way to make ethanol. He is using acids on paper material. He says a large factory could produce ethanol from waste paper at a cost about the same as the cost of producing gasoline. Environmentalists support the use of ethanol because it turns solid waste into a useful product. Professor Holzapple says law makers in industrial nations need to support the development of this clean, less expensive fuel of the future.

The organization is involved in the production of ethanol because it can be made from corn. One company in the American Midwest says it is starting to produce ethanol because of demands from people and from the government. The Congress approved the Clean Air Act in 1990. The company says this means the market for ethanol will expand. The company is a major producer of corn starch that can be used to make ethanol. At Texas A and M University Professor Mark Holzapple produces ethanol from materials found in solid waste. He has developed a way to turn materials like paper into simple sugar. He then uses yeast to turn the sugar into ethanol. Professor Holzapple says two hundred liters of ethanol fuel can be produced from one ton of solid waste. A professor at the University of Arkansas, John Geddie, is exploring another way to make ethanol. He is using acids on paper material. He says a large factory could produce ethanol from waste paper at a cost about the same as the cost of producing gasoline. Environmentalists support the use of ethanol because it turns solid waste into a useful product. Professor Holzapple says law makers in industrial nations need to support the development of this clean, less expensive fuel of the future.

The national college exam, known as the \"Gaokao\" has been used to evaluate Chinese students for three decades. The Ministry of Education has worked out a plan for reforming exams and enrollment. The Ministry will solicit  public opinions before its release. Instead, tests will be held several times a year to allow students to choose when and how often they sit the exam so as to ease study pressure and change China's once-in-a-lifetime exam system. The plan and suggestion for its implementation  will be announced in the first half of next year. It will be piloted in selected provinces and cities and promoted nationwide from 2017. A new exam and admission system will be established by 2020, according to the education ministry. The decision has aroused a heated discussion among Shanghai educators and parents who doubted the reform would reduce the burden of learning English or if the substitute test could reflect a student's English skills and help students learn English better. \"The reform shows China is learning from the West to give students more test-taking chances.

Derrius felt different from other kids. In seventh grade, Derrius went to live in a foster home  . His foster parents weren't nice to him. They told him that he'd never be anything in life. Derrius didn't do his best in school. The summer after ninth grade, that changed. Derrius had signed up for a biology class. He didn't go to class the first day. On the second day, he showed up late. His teacher took him outside. She told him he was smart, but that he was wasting his potential  . The talk inspired him and he planned to prove that he could be anything if he worked hard enough. Adults at a summer program helped Derrius find out about scholarships he could earn to pay for college. In his senior year, Derrius filled out lots of applications. He told his friends, \"You're not going to see me for a long time.\" Derrius's hard work paid off. He won more than $1 million in scholarships! He has a lot to be proud of. But he's most proud of helping others. Derrius gives speeches to teens, telling them how to find scholarships. In high school, Derrius got help buying a computer. He wanted to help others who needed them. Last year, he gave two laptops to high school students. There's a lot of work in his future. Derrius doesn't mind -- hard work has got him where he is today. He knows can take him anywhere. What does the author want to tell us?", "subject": ""}
