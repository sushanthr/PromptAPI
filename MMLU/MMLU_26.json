The company Terrafugia, based in Woburn, Massachusetts, says it plans to deliver its carplane, the Transition, so customers by the end of 2011. \"It's the next'wow'vehicle,\"said Terrafugia vice president Richard Gersh.\"Anybody can buy a Ferrari, but as we say, Ferraris don't fly.\" The carplane has wings that unfold for flying-a process the company says takes one minute-and fold back up for driving. A runway is still required to take off and land. The Transition is being marketed more as a plane that drives than a car that flies, although it is both. The company has been working with FAA to meet aircraft regulations, and with the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration to meet vehicle safety regulations. The company is aiming to sell the Transition to private pilots as a more convenient and cheaper way to fly. They say it saves you the trouble from trying to find another mode of transportation to get to and from airports: You drive the car to the airport and then you're good to go. When you land, you fold up the wings and hit the road. There are no expensive parking fees because you don't have to store it at an airport-you park it in the garage at home. The carplane is designed to fly primarily under 10,000 feet. It has a maximum takeoff weight of 1,430 pounds, including fuel and passengers. Terrafugia says the Transition reduces the potential for an accident by allowing pilots to drive under the bad weather instead of flying into marginal   conditions. The Transition's price tag:$ 194,000. But there may be additional charges for options like a radio, a transponder or a GPS. Another option is a fullplane parachute. \"If you get into a very awful situation,it is the necessary safety option,\"Gersh said. So far, the company has more than 70 orders with deposits.\"We're working very closely with them, but there are still some remaining steps,\"Brown said.

And obviously, in order to do that, it is absolutely vital that we have a strong relationship with China. So, Mr. Vice President, I hope you have a wonderful visit while you're here. I'm sure the American people welcome you. I'm glad that you're going to get an opportunity to get out of Washington. I know you'll be visiting Lowa, which you visited many years ago when you were governor. And I understand you're also going to Los Angeles and maybe even taking in   a Lakers basketball game.

In a study of British schoolchildren, it was found that children by age eight were much more familiar with characters from television shows and video games than common wildlife. Without modem technology, a small pond could be an amazing world filled with strange and beautiful plants, insects, birds, and animals. When we lack meaningful interaction with the world around us, and sometimes even with our families and friends, we seek to understand and communicate with things that exist only in our imaginations or on a computer screen. The world of make-believe is not necessarily bad, but when the world of fantasy becomes the only outlet for our sense of wonder, then we are really missing something. We are missing a connection with the living world. Other wonderful worlds exist all around us. But even more interesting is that if we look closely enough,we can see that these worlds, in a broad sense ,are really part of our own. What is the main purpose of the passage?", "subject": ""}
{"answer": 1, "choices": ["They will do homework on computers.", "They will study all by themselves.", "They will have fun with teachers.", "They will prepare for exams."], "question": "Homework will not be a concern for pupils attending a pioneering new secondary school in Norfolk. Instead, the 1,100 children will stay longer at school, doing extra study at school as part of the extended school day, which could last until about 5 pm. Rather than setting homework that pupils could struggle with at home, where there may be limited access to computers, they will do that as independent study in the day. When they go home they should enjoy quality family time. That has been really well received by parents who respect the fact that family time will be family time. But the school would still expect youngsters to study at home ahead of important exams. Independent learning at school would ensure equality because kids who get help with homework from parents might rely on others too much. Peter Devonish , a teacher at the school, said, \"Having the children at school a bit longer to strengthen their learning is a really good idea, because they can have their time with the family.\" But he warned. \"A disadvantage is that our school is in the countryside, which means it's not so perfect to get children home at that time.\" Mr. Devonish said they also set pupils project-based homework, such as looking at an energy-efficient house, which allowed them to combine independent study with working with their parents.

Some researchers consider that attitudes come from differences between beliefs and ideas; others believe that attitudes come from emotional states. Here, we focus on the effects of attitudes upon behavior, that is, upon the choices of action made by the individual. The kinds of actions taken by human beings are obviously influenced greatly by attitudes. Whether one listens to classical music or rock, whether one obeys the speed limit while driving, whether one encourages one's husband or wife to express his or her own ideas--all are influenced by attitudes. These internal states are acquired throughout life from situations one is faced with in the home, in the streets, and in the school. Of course, the course of action chosen by an individual in any situation will be largely determined by the particulars of that situation. An individual who has a strong attitude of obeying laws may drive too fast when he is in a hurry and no police cars in sight. A child who has a strong attitude of honesty may steal a penny when she thinks no one will notice. But the internal state which remains unchanged over a period of time, and which makes the individual behave regularly in a variety of situations, is what is meant by an attitude. Attitudes are learned in a variety of ways. They can result from single incidents, as when an attitude toward snakes is acquired by an experience in childhood at the sudden movement of a snake. They can result from the individual's experiences of success and pleasure, as when someone acquires a positive attitude toward doing crossword puzzles by being able to complete some of them.

Serotonin, a hormone  , passes chemical messages between nerve cells. It has been closely linked to mood. Several anti-depressant   drugs regulate serotonin levels.    Scientists had also identified three variants   of the gene. Two so-called \"short\" variants were linked to a higher risk of depression and suicide attempts. Unlike the two \"short\" variants, the \"long\" variant of 5-HTTLPR showed a clear dislike of negative images, such as fierce animals, and a clear liking for positive ones, such as flowers.    Researchers from the University of Essex in Britain showed participants a series of images, which were divided into three kinds: negative ones aimed at inspiring fear or stress such as a snake or person about to commit suicide, pleasant ones and neutral   ones.     The participants who had the long variant of the 5-HTTLPR gene \"showed a clear dislike of negative material alongside a careful attention for positive material,\" the researchers found. They paid close attention to the pretty pictures, and ignored the frightening ones. On the other hand, the short variant groups had the opposite reaction.    In January, the Australian government organized \"happiness workshops\", teaching government staff how to be happy. The department that held the \"happiness workshops\" said unhappy staff weren't productive staff.     Australian political opposition parties have argued that the \"happiness workshops\" are probably a waste of money and couldn't increase productivity as intended. However, whether the workshop will have a happy or disappointing result, we will have to wait and see. The article is mainly about   _  .", "subject": ""}

She was an unwanted child whose parents never married. She was brought up on her grandmother's farm. The possibility that she would become rich and famous was slim. Oprah's mother left her child in her mother's care, so she could go to work in Milwaukee, Wisconsin. It was a strict and difficult life for Oprah. But it also led the way for her future. She was a highly intelligent child. By the age of three, she had learned to read and write. She also made her first public appearance at that age. Oprah's intelligence was resented   by other children of her age. They called her unkind names and pushed her away. Oprah felt very isolated and unwanted. It made her feel worse that she didn't live with her mother and father. She felt that no one loved her. This made her angry and rebellious  . These feelings brought her much trouble as she was growing up. She often behaved badly, causing her grandmother to punish her. By the age of seven, she was too much for her grandmother to discipline. Then Oprah went to live with her mother, Vernita, who worked very hard as a housekeeper in Milwaukee. It was hard for her to work and take care of her bright, troublesome child. They lived in poverty in a small apartment. Oprah took out all her angry feelings on her mother. When Oprah was eight, Vernita sent her to live with her father and stepmother in Nashville, Tennessee. But she moved again a few months later when Vernita married a man with two children. Vernita wanted Oprah to be with her and her new family. Unfortunately, she felt she didn't belong with them. She believed she wasn't loved by anyone. Her angry and frustration grew stronger. She struck back by misbehaving and running away from home. Her parents found her impossible to discipline. When she was 14, they tried to send her to a special center for troubled girls. But there was no room for her. So Vernita sent Oprah back to live with her father. Vernon Winfrey was by then a successful businessman and family man. He took one look at his daughter and knew she needed love, guidance and discipline. He gave her all three. It was a turning point in Oprah's life. He was strict about his daughter's education. He gave her homework in addition to her schoolwork. She was allowed to watch only one hour of television a day. She became an A student and a popular girl in her class. Oprah watched Barbara Walters, a famous journalist, and decided that was what she wanted to be.

The area traditionally produced little wheat, while North Africa was the grain basket. Wheat production fell sharply in sub-Saharan countries during the 1980s. In the 1960s, attempts were made to grow wheat in sub-Saharan Africa, including South Africa and Zimbabwe. But those countries found it was less costly to import wheat from Europe and the United States. Another problem is that Africa's wheat farms were often far from population centers. There also were transportation issues. And some lowlands were not a good place to grow wheat. Hans Joachim Braun,one of the experts, says now is a good time to increase wheat production. In the last four years we have seen three major price hikes, where the wheat price and other staple process  exploded. And that puts a big, big bill on countries which are depending on wheat imports, and Africa is the biggest wheat importer. He also says demand for wheat in sub-Saharan Africa is growing faster than for any other crop. With higher income people would like to have more diversified food. But that is possible not the most important one. The most important one is that there is a tremendous migration of in particular male labor to the cities. And wheat products are convenient food because you can easily buy it. It's easy to process and you also can store it for a few days, which is different from some of the maize and rice products. There are three possible challenges for growing more wheat in Africa: climate change, disease and pests, like insects. Mr. Braun says rising temperatures should not have a major effect on wheat. In fact, he says, it could help wheat grow in areas with high rainfall totals. As for fighting disease and pests, experts suggest growing more resistant crops. In addition, railroads and roads would have to be improved so large amounts of wheat could be moved to large markets. Wheat price exploding indicates  _  .", "subject": ""}

But those countries found it was less costly to import wheat from Europe and the United States. Another problem is that Africa's wheat farms were often far from population centers. There also were transportation issues. And some lowlands were not a good place to grow wheat. Hans Joachim Braun,one of the experts, says now is a good time to increase wheat production. In the last four years we have seen three major price hikes, where the wheat price and other staple process  exploded. And that puts a big, big bill on countries which are depending on wheat imports, and Africa is the biggest wheat importer. He also says demand for wheat in sub-Saharan Africa is growing faster than for any other crop. With higher income people would like to have more diversified food. But that is possible not the most important one. The most important one is that there is a tremendous migration of in particular male labor to the cities. And wheat products are convenient food because you can easily buy it. It's easy to process and you also can store it for a few days, which is different from some of the maize and rice products. There are three possible challenges for growing more wheat in Africa: climate change, disease and pests, like insects. Mr. Braun says rising temperatures should not have a major effect on wheat. In fact, he says, it could help wheat grow in areas with high rainfall totals. As for fighting disease and pests, experts suggest growing more resistant crops. In addition, railroads and roads would have to be improved so large amounts of wheat could be moved to large markets. Why is there a higher demand for wheat in sub-Saharan Africa?", "subject": ""}

The study results also indicate that pessimism can be linked to increased risk for sudden death from accidents or violence, according to the report published in the March issue ofPsychological Science. Christopher Peterson of the University of Michigan and his colleagues analyzed data from the Terman Life-Cycle Study, which began by studying California public-school children with high IQs in 1921 and followed them through their life. Most of the 1,528 children were teenagers when the study began. Those still living are now in their 80s. In 1936 and 1940, participants were asked to complete a questionnaire designed to obtain information about difficult life events and their effect on overall outlook. One such question was, \"What do you regard as your most serious fault of personality or character?\" Pessimists were defined as fatalistic people who tend to blame themselves when things go wrong and who believe that one bad event can ruin the rest of their life. They also tend to expect bad things to happen to them and feel that they have little or no ability to change their situation. Males were more likely than females to be classified as pessimistic. Compared with individuals with a more cheerful and optimistic outlook, pessimists were more likely to die from accidents and violence (including suicide). A pessimistic personality may lead to poor problem-solving ability, social difficulties and risky decision-making.

Numerology is a way of using numbers to describe a person's character, and to make predictions about future life events. Numerologists use the numbers 1-9, 11 and 22 -- also known as the \"master\" numbers -- to help a person understand his or her personality, life goals, and destiny. Numerologists consider yourLife Path number to be the most significant because this number describes your character. To find this number, add together all the numbers in your date of birth. For example, a person born on April 25, 1985 would add the month (4), to the numbers of the date (2+5), plus the numbers of the birth year (1+9+8+5). In this case the total is 34, so this person's life path number is 7(3+4). Numerologists believe that people with this number are peaceful and affectionate but can also be very reserved. Your Expression numberdescribes your talents and predicts how you should use these to fulfill your destiny in life. Numerologists assign a number between 1 and 9 to each of the letters in your name. These numbers are then added together in the same way as before to find your Expression number. Numerologists can also do calculations to predict when the most challenging periods of your life will be. Numerologists also believe that the day a person is born is important. Each day of the month has a character description. People born on the fourth are said to be responsible, honest, and stubborn. People born on the fifteenth have very strong attachments to family and home. Those who celebrate their birthday on the thirtieth are artistic, creative, and imaginative, and often make good writers. If we calculate the numerical value of our name and birth date, numerologists believe that we can learn more about our personalities.

For example, a person born on April 25, 1985 would add the month (4), to the numbers of the date (2+5), plus the numbers of the birth year (1+9+8+5). In this case the total is 34, so this person's life path number is 7(3+4). Numerologists believe that people with this number are peaceful and affectionate but can also be very reserved. Your Expression numberdescribes your talents and predicts how you should use these to fulfill your destiny in life. Numerologists assign a number between 1 and 9 to each of the letters in your name. These numbers are then added together in the same way as before to find your Expression number. Numerologists can also do calculations to predict when the most challenging periods of your life will be. Numerologists also believe that the day a person is born is important. Each day of the month has a character description. People born on the fourth are said to be responsible, honest, and stubborn. People born on the fifteenth have very strong attachments to family and home. Those who celebrate their birthday on the thirtieth are artistic, creative, and imaginative, and often make good writers. If we calculate the numerical value of our name and birth date, numerologists believe that we can learn more about our personalities. They also believe that we can predict our destinies, how our lives will progress, and what challenges we may face along the way. To the numerologist, numbers can be used in many more ways than we think. The function of the passage is   _  .", "subject": ""}

{"answer": 3, "choices": ["Authority.", "Dignity.", "Liberty.", "Care."], "question": "The other morning on the subway I sat next to an attractive young blonde woman who was reading something on her iPad. She was very well-dressed, carrying a Prada bag with tastefully applied make-up indeed, she had an unmistakable air of wealth, material success and even authority. I suspected she worked as a highly-paid Wall Street lawyer or stockbroker or something of that sort. So, I was curious to see what she was so focused on. The Wall Street Journal perhaps? The Economist? Quite the contrary; rather, she was concentrating on a romance novel. Then I realized that I have known many women who love romance novels--smart, attractive, successful, \"liberated,\" modem females who nonetheless find some kind of deep satisfaction and thrill from those hyper-romantic, artificial and extremely unrealistic tales of handsome, manly heroes falling in love with virginal women, enduring a series of adventures, then no doubt having a happy ending.  _ . Yet, the genre  remains enormously popular. Consider some of these surprising statistics from the good folks at the Romance Writers of America (RWA): *More than 9,000 romance titles were released last year, with sales of about $1.44 billion (more than triple the revenues generated by classic literary fiction). *More than 90 percent of the market are women (okay, that's not at all surprising). * Readers are typically women between the ages 30 and 54 who are themselves involved in a romantic relationship (betraying the stereotype that only lonely women long for these tales of love and adventure). *Almost 40 percent of romance book consumers have an annual income of between $50,000 and $99,900 (placing them firmly in the middle class). I had thought that romance novels accounted for a very small share of the literary market, so I was quite surprised that this part has such enormous popularity. But I must wonder why so many women--forty years after the women's liberation movement continue to indulge in the fanciful tales? I'm not sure if it represents a kind of \"rejection\" of the women's liberation movement, but clearly something is missing in the lives of contemporary ladies. A romance author named Donna Hatch who focuses on the Regency period (early 19th century Britain) explained the appeal of such books this way: \"Regency men were civilized and treated women with courtesy. When a lady entered the room, gentlemen stood, doffed their hats, offered an arm, bowed, and a hundred other little things I wish men still did today. But they were also very athletic; they hunted, raced, boxed, rode horses. They were manly. Strong. Noble. Honorable. And that is why I love them!\" Mrs. Hatch may have expressed the secret desires and attitudes of untold millions of her peers---that is, in the early 21st century, have women grown tired of the burdens and expectations that the \"freedoms\" they have gained give them? Is this a rejection of modem feminism? Do women long for days of old when men were masculine gentlemen and women were feminine and protected as precious treasures and regarded as possessions? Perhaps most women (even the ones who get lost in romance novels) do not want to go all the way back but it is obvious, _ .

The death marks the passing of a controversial figure who made a major impact on international affairs during his long rule. The Cuban government declared nine days of official mourning. On Monday, thousands of Cubans lined up near Havana's Plaza of the Revolution to pay their final respects to their leader. On Wednesday,Castro's ashes will begin a three-day journey across Cuba to Santa Ifigenia cemetery in Santiago de Cuba. Castro was born into a middle-class family on August 13 1926. He spent his childhood alongside the laborers on his father's plantation  . In 1945, Castro entered the University of Havana as a law student. He later joined groups that sought to end dictatorships in Latin-American countries. On July 26. 1953,Castro staged an unsuccessful revolt  against Batista's government. He and his brother Raul were captured and imprisoned for two years. After they were freed, the brothers went into exile in Mexico, On November 25, 1956,Castro set out once again to overthrow Batista. His revolution grew in strength. On New Year s Day 1959, Batista fled from Cuba. Castro took absolute power on January 8. The U.S. viewed Castro's relationship with the Soviet Union as a threat. In 1961,President John F. Kennedy approved the invasion of Cuba by 1,500 Cuban exiles. They landed on April 17 at the Bay of Pigs, but with little U. S. military support. Cuban troops smashed the attack within a few days. In October 1962,Castro confronted Kennedy during the Cuban Missile Crisis, during which he allowed the Soviet Union to place nuclear-capable missiles in Cuba. By that time, the U. S. had cut all relations with Cuba. After the Soviet Union collapsed in 1991,Cuba lost its economic support. To fuel the economy, the Cuban government allowed outside investment in hotels and resorts, but that created inequality. Meanwhile, Castro continued to crack down on any opposition.

Then again, some people work very hard for their entire life and only are able to pay their monthly living expenses. As a matter of fact, they usually end up working until the last day they are alive. On the other hand, many people who are well off, so to speak, and through no fault of their own, experience a rapid decline of their standard of living due to an unexpected disaster, poor health and /or a severe economic depression within the country in which they live. Additionally, well-educated people usually earn more money during their active working years and thus are able to save a great deal of money in which to support themselves after they retire from the work force. People also become wealthy as a result of their own determination or they inherit wealth from elder family members, or they simply continue to work in the business that past generations of their family worked within. It is also true that a person can simply be a lucky dog who wins a lottery or some such contests that give a great deal of wealth to the winner.

An example of whom is the person who wrote the Harry Potter novels. She was just an average person who became a billionaire.

If one should travel inland across the Great Plains and the Prairie   states of America, one will mostly not experience a hurricane, but there is another kind of storm in the Midwest which is equally feared. It is called a tornado. Tornados are violent low-pressured storms with an intense updraft   near their center which is capable of lifting quite heavy objects from the ground. A tornado,therefore, is a dark, funnel-shaped cloud containing violently rotating air. It can pick up trees and cars right into the air and even uplift heavier objects such as homes and railway cars. Like a vacuum cleaner across a rug, it sucks up into anything which may lie in its path. These storms occur most often during the summer months and are noticeable by their strong wind and lack of rain. The sky turns black as dust is sucked up into the air. Tornadoes travel normally around 60 kilometers per hour and the winds can reach 800 kilometers per hour in the most violent storms. Tornados are most frequent in the United States east of the Rocky Mountains and especially in the central plains area of the Mississippi basin where about 150 occur each year.

The Montreal Jazz Fest held the 2004 Guinness World Record as the world's largest jazz festival. This year the event is scheduled to run from June 29 to July 9. Stages replace cars along busy streets. With a host of free outdoor shows, you'll be snapping your fingers to anything from Dixieland to blues, African beats to modern trip-hop, and everything in between. Are you ready? Just head east to the Newfoundland Targa Rally, which runs from September 9 to 16 this year. The 2,200-kilometre race dashes across the eastern and central parts of the province, and is the largest race of its kind in North America. On these sections you race against the clock rather than other competitors. This is a great chance to test your car's limits and your skills. Hello spring!

Most of us feel bad when we make mistakes, beat ourselves up about it, feel like failures, get mad at ourselves. And that's only natural. Most of us have been taught from a young age that mistakes are bad, and we should try to avoid mistakes. We've been scolded when we make mistakes--at home, school and work. Maybe not always, but probably enough times to make feeling bad about mistakes an unconscious reaction. Yet without mistakes, we could not learn or grow. If you think about it that way, mistakes should be cherished and celebrated for being one of the most amazing things in the world.

By trial and error--trying things, making mistakes, and learning from those mistakes--we have figured out how to make electric light, to paint the ceiling of the Sistine Chapel, to fly.

Think about how we learn:We don't just consume information about something and instantly know it or know how to do it.

That's how we learn as babies and toddlers, and how we learn as adults. Mistakes are how we learn to do something new--because if you succeed at something, it's probably something you already knew how to do. You haven't really grown much from that success--at most it's the last step on your journey, not the whole journey. Most of the journey is made up of mistakes, if it's a good journey.

So far, he and his team have not succeeded, though they have cloned two cows and a cat. They just might succeed in cloning Missy soon -- or perhaps not for another five years. Westhusin's experience with cloning animals leaves him upset by all this talk of human cloning. In three years of work on the Missy project, using hundreds upon hundreds of dog's eggs, the A&M team has produced only a dozen or so embryos carrying Missy's DNA. None have survived the transfer to a surrogate mother. The wastage of eggs and the many spontaneously aborted(,) fetuses may be acceptable when you're dealing with cats or bulls, he argues, but not with humans. \"Cloning is incredibly inefficient, and also dangerous,\" he says. Even so, dog cloning is a commercial opportunity, with a nice research payoff. Ever since Dolly the sheep was cloned in 1997, Westhusin's phone has been ringing with people calling in hopes of duplicating their cats and dogs, cattle and horses. \"A lot of people want to clone pets, especially if the price is right,\" says Westhusin. Cost is no obstacle for Missy's mysterious billionaire owner; he's put up $3.7 million so far to fund A&M's research. Contrary to some media reports, Missy is not dead. The owner wants a twin to carry on Missy's fine qualities after she does die. The prototype(;)is, by all accounts, athletic, good-natured and supersmart. Missy's master does not expect an exact copy of her. He knows her clone may not have her temperament(, ). In a statement of purpose, Missy's owner and the A&M team say they are \"both looking forward to studying the ways that her clones differ from Missy.\" Besides cloning a great dog, the project may contribute insight into the old question of nature vs. nurture.

Paper cards are seen as wasteful and, for some people, going card-free is another way of going green. They also argue that in a world of e-mail, Skype, Facebook and Twitter, people are in touch all the time anyway; they no longer need the yearly card that connects them with long lost friends. If you want to send Christmas greetings, there are free e-cards, which get the job done with no postage or wasted paper. However, especially for people who didn't grow up with e-mail, there is something missing from a Christmas e-mail. The first Christmas cards appeared in London in 1843 and were designed by the same man who had introduced the world's first postage stamp three years earlier. His name was Sir Henry Cole. They rose in popularity throughout the 20th century. Many people sent cards that were sold for charity. The most famous of these are the ones sold for UNICEF. In the UK this year, in the three weeks before Christmas, the post office expects to handle 100 million cards every day. Environmental awareness also means that nowadays many people recycle their cards; this helps raise money to plant more trees, as well as recreating more paper. When we think of trees at Christmas, there is one that immediately springs mind---the evergreen tree that people decorate with ornaments and place their presents under. The custom dates back almost a thousand years to Germany. Nowadays 33 to 36 million Christmas trees are produced in America and 50 to 60 million in Europe each year.

The quake was felt strongly in Chengdu. Fortunately, all of the pandas here were out on the grounds when the earthquake hit, so they were very safe. Although no deaths or injuries have been reported among the Baoxing panda population so far, they've been badly frightened by the earthquake. Several days has passed and the earthquake seems to have made no discernible negative impact on the pandas. These two baby pandas Chengshuang and Chengdui are play fighting with each other and climbing trees. When they climbed too high, the breeders have to rescue them from the trees.  The visitors are amused by the scenes and think it's like a fantastic acrobatics show.  The quake zone is not only the home of these pandas, it's also the source of their food. Fortunately, enough bamboo has been stored away in five bamboo storehouses for the pandas, so there are no worries with regard to food supplies.  Wu Kongju, Breeder, Chengdu Panda Breeding Base, said, \"When the Wenchuan earthquake happened in 2008, we were unprepared and had a shortage of bamboo. But we've been able to handle this earthquake event more smoothly. There are no problems with the food supply. \"Apart from the pandas' favorite Baijia Bamboo, breeders also give them bamboo shoots, which are very rich in nutrients.  Wu Kongju said, \"Bamboo shoots contain more protein than ordinary bamboo, and they're also very succulent because they contain more water. \" What's the author's attitude towards the reaction of Chengdu Panda Breeding Base?", "subject": ""}

I never heard any noise from the children, but the parents were always yelling at the kids.     We often met in the hallway when we were coming or going. I always spoke, but the only answer I got was a \"Hello\" from the four-year-old girl.     One afternoon when I returned, they were just coming out of their apartment and the little girl was holding the door open for the others. I remained in the car doing unnecessary things. But when I looked up I saw the little girl was still holding the door open, waiting for me. I hurried as much as I could and thanked her.     I was really touched by her act of kindness. That afternoon I was at the K-Mart and I bought a white Teddy bear for her. The next day, there was a knock on the door and it was the little girl and her father. She was very proud of the bear and thanked me like I had never been thanked before.     Now when we meet in the hall, we all speak in a friendly manner. As time passes, I don't hear that yelling as often as before.     Last night we had about four inches of snow. I looked out at my car and wondered how I was going to keep my doctor's appointment.

Facebook's chief operating officer is going to speak about how the social web has transformed people's friendships and relationships. The survey found that there was a clear link between people's age and the number of online friends they have.The researchers found that those aged 13 to 16, have an average of 450 friends on social networks, with girls having slightly more friends that boys.People in their thirties tend to have between 100 and 200 friends, while those in their forties have between 50 and 100. However, those using sites such as Facebook over the age of 50, tended to have 20 or less friends.The oldest person surveyed was 70 years old. Paul Hudson, Intersperience's chief executive, said: \"Our research underlines fundamental  changes taking place in British society as a result of finally entering the digital age.Half of the UK population are on Facebook now.In a social media context, a 'friend' means something different to a 20 year old than to a 50 year old.\" He added: \"Social networking activity is just one example of how different groups are adapting to the digital age at different paces.In this case, age is the determining factor - however in other instances it is not.\" According to the passage, the following statements are True except  _  .", "subject": ""}

Orange and blue are also recommended colors for companies to use, because orange is the color of communication and blue suggests safety. So this could be a particularly good combination. Companies have found that certain colors \"speak\" to specific age groups.

In order to be able to develop the equivalent of a periodic table of the elements, Thomson had to be able to classify knots -- find out which different knots were possible. This sparked a great interest in the mathematical theory of knots. A mathematical knot looks very much like a familiar knot in a string, only with the string's ends joined. In Thomson's theory, knots could, in principle at least, model atoms of increasing complexity, such as the hydrogen, carbon, and oxygen atoms, respectively. For knots to be truly useful in a mathematical theory, however, mathematicians searched for some precise way of proving that what appeared to be different knots were really different -- the couldn't be transformed one into the other by some simple manipulation . Towards the end of the nineteenth century, the Scottish mathematician Peter Guthrie Tait and the University of Nebraska professor Charles Newton Little published complete tables of knots with up to ten crossings. Unfortunately, by the time that this heroic effort was completed, Kelvin's theory had already been totally discarded as a model for atomic structure. Nevertheless, even without any other application in sight, the mathematical interest in knot theory continued at _ point for its own sake. In fact, mathematical became even more fascinated by knots. The only difference was that, as the British mathematician Sir Michael Atiyah has put it, \"the study of knots became a special branch of pure mathematics. \" Two major breakthroughs in knot theory occurred in 1928 and in 1984. In 1928, the American mathematician James Waddell Alexander discovered an algebraic expression that uses the arrangement of crossings to label the knot. For example, t2-t+1 or t2-3t+1, or else. Decades of work in the theory of knots finally produced the second breakthrough in 1984. The New Zealander-American mathematician Vaughan Jones noticed an unexpected relation between knots and another abstract branch of mathematics, which led to the discovery of a more sensitive invariant known as the Jones polynomial.

Knots, enjoy a long history of tales and fanciful names such as \"Englishman's tie, \" \"and \"cat's paw. \" Knots became the subject of serious scientific investigation when in the 1860s the English physicist William Thomson (known today as Lord Kelvin) proposed that atoms were in fact knotted tubes of ether . In order to be able to develop the equivalent of a periodic table of the elements, Thomson had to be able to classify knots -- find out which different knots were possible.

Seeds and plants accidentally brought to Antarctica by tourists and scientists may introduce alien plant species which could threaten the survival of native plants in the finely balanced ecosystem. \"The people that were carrying the most had lots and lots of seeds. They really were real threats,\" said Dana Bergstrom, from the Australian Antarctic Division. \"When we take things in through hitchhiking  then we get species which are competitive. The plants and animals there are not necessarily competitive, so we'd start losing various precious biodiversity  on the (Antarctic) continent\", Bergstrom told Reuters. Amongst the alien species discovered were the Iceland Poppy, and Annual Winter Grass -- all from cold climates and capable of growing in Antarctica. The Antarctic Peninsula, where most tourists travel, is now considered a \"hot spot\" on the frozen continent and the warmer the climate, the easier for seeds to grow. \"The peninsula  is warming at some of the greatest rates on the planet,\" said Bergstrom.

The earthquakes keep coming hard and fast this year, causing people to wonder if something evil   is happening underfoot. It's not. While it may seem as if there are more earthquakes occurring, there really aren't. The problem is what's happening above ground, not underground, experts say. More people are moving into big cities that happen to be built in quake zones, and they're rapidly putting up buildings that can't withstand   earthquakes, scientists believe. And around-the-clock news coverage   and better earthquake monitoring  make it seem as if earthquakes are ever-present. \"I can definitely tell you that the world is not coming to an end,\" said Bob Holdsworth, an expert in tectonics   at Durharn University in the UK. A 7.0 magnitude quake in January killed more than 230,000 people in Haiti. Last month, an 8.8 magnitude quake--- the fifth-strongest since 1900--killed more than 900 people in Chile. And two weeks ago, a 6.0 magnitude quake struck rural eastern Turkey, killing at least 57 people. On average, there are 134 earthquakes a year that have a magnitude between 6.0 and 6.9, according to the US Geological Survey. This year is off to a fast start with 40 so far--more than in most years for that time period. But that's because the 8.8 quake in Chile generated a large number of strong aftershocks, and so many quakes early this year skews   the picture, said Paul Earle, a US seismologist  . Also, it's not the number of quakes, but their devastating impacts  that gain attention, with the death tolls   largely due to construction standards (building standard) and crowding, Earle added. \"The standard mantra   is earthquakes don't kill people, buildings do, \" he said.

But that's because the 8.8 quake in Chile generated a large number of strong aftershocks, and so many quakes early this year skews   the picture, said Paul Earle, a US seismologist  . Also, it's not the number of quakes, but their devastating impacts  that gain attention, with the death tolls   largely due to construction standards (building standard) and crowding, Earle added. \"The standard mantra   is earthquakes don't kill people, buildings do, \" he said. Ks*5*u There have been more deaths over the past decades from earthquakes, said University of Colorado geologist Roger Bilham. In an opinion column last month in the journal Nature, Bilham called for better construction standards in the world's big cities. Of the 130 cities worldwide with populations of more than 1 million, more than half are prone   to earthquakes, Bilham said. Developing nations, where populations are growing, don't pay attention to earthquake preparedness, Bilham said.\" If you have a problem feeding yourself, you're not really going to worry about earthquakes.\" Another reason quakes seem worse is that we're paying attention more. The Haiti earthquake quickly followed by the 8.8 in Chile made everyone start to think. But it won't last, said US disaster researcher Deniis Mileti. \"People are paying attention to the violent planet we've always lived on,\" Mileti said.\" Come back in another six months if there has been no earthquakes, most people will have forgotten it again. \" According to the article, the greater damage of earthquakes this year can be mainly caused by   _  .", "subject": ""}

It's absolutely true that kids should learn about how a credit card works and how to use it responsibly. But the idea that they need a card of their own to practise this is questionable. Yes, credit cards are a teaching tool, but it's the time you spend educating them about money management that does the teaching, not the piece of plastic. Sit down with your child--here we are referring to teens and walk them through your credit card statements. Point out important things like the due date, late fee warning, and APR  . If you have good credit, adding a child as an authorized user onto one of your credit cards also provides teachable moments. Allow kids to use the card to make specific purchases and require their participation in payment. Since the card is still in your name, you can take them off it at any point and cut off their access if they're not able to handle the responsibility. Another option is to set them up with an account at a local bank that offers free use of a debit card  . Unlike credit card, the debit card has no overdraft   function. Children can only use the card to pay for things and the money is taken directly from their bank account. If the account is empty, the worst that will happen is the card being declined at a cash register. What is the purpose of adding kids as credit card authorized users?", "subject": ""}

{"answer": 2, "choices": ["They are too young to tell right from wrong.", "They are eager to challenge themselves.", "They care a lot about what their peers think of them.", "Their brains are more sensitive to thrilling events."], "question": "Sometimes having a teenager at home can be a real headache. Many teenagers smoke, drink, wear strange hairdos and even fight. Basically, they are often taking risks. Earlier studies have shown that teenagers are more likely to make _ decisions than people from any other age group, including children and adults. Is it that teenagers are too young to tell right from wrong? Not really. So what explains their risky behavior? According to Laurence Steinberg, a professor at Temple University, US, the reason is that teens care a lot about how their peers   view them - that's the effect of \"peer influence\", reported Science Daily. As children enter their teenage years, they spend more time with their friends and classmates and also become more sensitive to their feedback  . This sensitivity drives teenagers to concentrate on the short-term benefits of making risky choices and overlook the costs. In a test, a group of teenagers were asked to play a video driving game. When they played with their friends watching, they took more chances and drove more carelessly because that would increase their possibility of winning. But when they played alone, they tended to drive more safely. Why does pressure from peers have such a big influence on teens' behavior? As Steinberg sees it, a teenager's brain is like a car with a good accelerator   but a weak brake  . The \"accelerator\", the brain's ability to notice the benefits of things, is fully developed by teenage years while the \"brake\", the brain part related to controlling impulses   and long-term thinking, is still immature . When teens are under the pressure of being judged by their peers, they tend to push hard on the accelerator. Given how weak the brake is, it is likely that they are going to end up in a crash. But the good news here, according to Steinberg, is that a violent teenager doesn't necessarily become a violent adult. About two-thirds to three-quarters of violent youth grow out of it. \"They get more self-controlled,\" Steinberg told Live Science. Also, people who haven't committed a violent crime by age 19 are less likely to start doing it later, added Steinberg. Why are teenagers likely to take risks according to the text?", "subject": ""}

It all depends on the quality of work you do. Not on the quantity. Here's how I did it yesterday. You should never forget your warm-up.

Do you have nomophobia ? * You never turn your phone off * You obsessively check for texts, missed calls and emails* You always take your phone to the bathroom with you* You never let the battery run out It's funny to think that around 20 years ago the only people with mobile phones would be businessperson carrying their large, plastic 'bricks'.   Of course, these days, mobile phones are everywhere. A UN study from this year said mobile phone subscriptions would outnumber people across the world by the end of 2014. And when there are more phones than people in the world, maybe it's time to ask who really is in charge? Are you in control of your phone, or does your phone control you? So, what happened with my university friend? When I arrived a few minutes late he just laughed and said: \"You haven't changed at all - still always late!\" And we had a great afternoon catching up, full of jokes and stories, with no interruptions and no nagging  desire to check my phone. Not having it with me felt strangely liberating. Maybe I'll leave it at home on purpose next time. What's the author's attitude towards the using mobiles ?", "subject": ""}

If you're a parent who spends long hours on the job, you probably feel sorry for spending so much time away from your kids. But the results of a new study show that a mother's voice alone can be just as comforting to an anxious   child as physical contact  . In an experiment, researchers from the University of Wisconsin-Madison asked a group of girls between the age of 7 and 12 to solve math problems in front of judges --- a stressful   situation for anyone. Before the girls were set to solve math problems, the researchers measured their levels of two hormones  : cortisol, which goes up during stressful periods, and oxytocin, the \"love\" hormone. After they were finished, some of the girls got to meet up with their mothers right away. The mums came in and hugged the girls. Another group of the girls didn't see their mothers, but received phone calls from them, in which their mothers told them how well they'd done. The final group had no contact with their mothers, but watched an animal movie, March of the Penguins instead. Finally, the girls' hormone levels were measured again. Although the movie was interesting, it did nothing to ease   the children's anxiety   ---- but, surprisingly, both the physical contact and phone calls from their mothers had the same effect on easing the girls' stress levels.

The rules are as follows:    RULE 1: Appreciate the Person. Most Americans like to be recognized as individuals as someone special with unique characteristics and personalities. Therefore, never say, \" You're from America so I want to be your friend.\" Also don't imply that the reason why you approached them is because you wanted someone to practice your English with. That turns people off. Instead try saying,\" You seem like a real nice and interesting person and I would like to get to know you better.\" This way, they are much more inclined to be friendly because you see them as a three dimensional person and appreciate them for who they are in the inside. And by doing so, you not only learn about America and practice your English, but also gain a real friend in the process.    RULE 2:Quit Calling Us Foreigners. Please refrain from calling a foreigner a foreigner especially in his face. The word makes people feel like an outsider, and even unwelcome, suggesting separation and insurmountable differences, widening an already existing gap in the situation.    When Americans travel, they rarely say, \"I'm foreign to your place.\" They tend to say, \"I'm new in town. I'm new here.\" The reason is because new and unfamiliar things can become old and familiar. But can foreign things become native? Aha? You catch my drift.    RULE 3: Just Do It. Some students like to be told about American culture but are less interested in spending the time and the effort to actually experience it. As Americans always say, \"Get your hands dirty.\" Until you have first hand and hands on experience, you'll never really know anything. Right?    So whenever you have the opportunity to participate in American culture, don't just sit there and watch. Get up and get involved!    RULE 4: Find that Common Language.

By that I don't mean English, Chinese, German, French, etc. I mean finding something you have in common with another person on a spiritual and philosophical level: likes, dislikes, worldviews, ways of thinking, and attitudes toward life.

The shock waves from the financial crisis   that started in the United States have spread across the entire world, sending developed nations, including Japan and those of Europe, into serious recession . The world is now holding out hope that China, with its massive potential, will serve as the engine to fuel global economic growth. But China's real economic growth slowed sharply to 6.8 percent in the October-December quarter. For China, this rate of economic expansion must be as disappointing as negative growth is for Japan. Beijing has set an official goal of achieving a minimum annual growth rate of 8 percent -- a pace it regards as important to ensuring job security. The Chinese government is apparently confident the nation will achieve the minimum growth target of 8 percent in 2009. At the World Economic Forum's annual meeting of political and business leaders in Davos, Switzerland, Chinese Premier Wen Jiabao stressed the Chinese economy began to show signs of recovery late last year. Last week, however, the International Monetary Fund predicted that China's economic growth in 2009 will be 6.7 percent. China's economic outlook is likely to keep both hope and anxiety for the time being. China's impressive economic growth has been fueled by swelling exports and massive investment  in equipment to produce goods for overseas. But the US, Japanese and European economies, which have absorbed the bulk  of China's exports, are expected to shrink simultaneous in 2009, for the first time since the end of World War II. For the first time since it started serious efforts to turn itself into a market economy in the 1990s, China is facing the challenge of maintaining healthy economic growth without depending on external demand. Expansion of domestic   demand holds a key to China's success in tackling this challenge. Consumer spending accounts for only 35 percent of China's gross  ) domestic product. The ratio  is considerably lower than the 70 percent for the United States and the nearly 60 percent for Japan. That is because the middle class - the group that should lead consumer spending - is still relatively small in China, where the benefits of the nation's strong economic growth in recent years have mostly eluded rural villages and low-income earners.

Empathy is the ability to understand and share the feelings of another person, and the two types investigated were cognitive   empathy and affective   empathy. \"Every day people use empathy with, and without, their knowledge to get around in the social world,\" said Robert Eres from Monash University's School of Psychological Sciences. \"We use it for communication, to build relationships, and to increase our understanding of others.\" \"People who are high on affective empathy are often those who get quite fearful when watching a scary movie, or start crying during a sad scene.

This is according to a study in which researchers played voice recordings to wild African elephants. The animals showed more fear when they heard the voices of adult Masai men. Livestock-herding Masai people do come into conflict with elephants, and this suggests that animals have adapted to specifically listen for and avoid them. The study is published in Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences. Prof Karen McComb and Dr Graeme Shannon from the University of Sussex led the study. They explained that in previous research they had used similar playback experiments to show that elephants could tell --- from the sound of a lion's roar --- whether the animal was a female or a more dangerous male. Prof McComb wanted to find out if the animals used their very sharp sense of hearing to identify a potential danger from humans. The scientists recorded Masai men, women and children saying, in their own language, \"Look, look over there, a group of elephants is coming\". They also recorded Kamba men saying this phrase. While cattle-herding Masai people often come across free-ranging elephants, which can result in violent conflict, the Kamba people's more agricultural lifestyle does not generally bring them into aggressive touch with the animals. When the team played recordings of these different voices through a hidden loudspeaker, they found that elephant family groups reacted more fearfully in response to the voice of a Masai man, than to a Kamba man's voice.

Work the stairs You can complete an excellent, effective -- and very brief -- workout in an office stairwell, says Martin Gibala, a professor of kinesiology at McMaster University in Canada and an expert on interval training. For a study that he and his colleagues presented earlier this year, they asked 12 out-of-shape women in their 20s to warm up for two minutes by slowly walking up and down stairs in a campus office building. They completed three of these abbreviated stair workouts per week for six weeks. By the end, their aerobic fitness had improved substantially, the researchers reported, by about as much as if they had been running or cycling each week for hours. Fidget your way to fitness. Parents and teachers may once have urged you to sit still, but wiggling, tapping your toes, standing briefly, and otherwise fidgeting as much as possible at your desk is in fact good for your body.

Eight hours in the office plus three hours in front of the TV after work is the norm for many people.     You probably don't need an expert to tell you that sitting too much is not good for your health--from an increased risk of heart disease and obesity in the long term,to reduced cholesterol maintenance in the short term,not to mention the strain on your neck and spine.     To make matters worse,many researches show a good diet and regular exercise call't reduce the negative effects of sitting too much.     A 2010 study of nearly 9,000 Australians found that for each additional hour of television a person watched per day,the risk of dying rose by 11 percent.Another study tracked the health of 123,000 Americans between 1992 and 2006.The death rate for men who spent six hours or more per day sitting was about 20 percent higher than for men who sat for three hours or less.     So what can we do about it? Health experts suggest we break up those many hours spent sitting with more hours spent standing.     The BBC conducted a simple experiment with a group of 10 volunteers who usually spent most of the day sitting.They were asked to stand for at least three hours a day.The researchers took measurements Oil days when the volunteers stood,and when they sat around.When they looked at the data there were some striking differences,the BBC reported. Blood sugar leveled off much quicker on the days when the study subjects stood compared with the days they spent in a chair.Standing also burned more calories----about 50 calories an hour.A member said although doing exercise offers many proven benefits,our bodies also need the increase in muscle activity that standing provides.

While one of the intruders pointed a gun at the group, the other two scooped up $4,400 worth of laptops, cell phones, video games and cash. Once they had what they wanted, the trio fled into the night. Furious, the students chased down and tackled one of the burglars -- the one with the gun. In the struggle, it went off, and a bullet grazed a student's leg. His friends piled on the gunman and held him until police showed up. By the next day, the injured young man was back in his apartment, and the suspect was in jail, charged with burglary, felonious assault and receiving stolen property. But how did the men manage to storm into an on-campus residence that November night in the first place? Simple: Students told police the building's main doors hadn't latched properly for days.

Usually, the polar researchers have good meals. Some even have feasts on holidays like Christmas and New Year's Day. Vegetables are always welcome and usually finished the quickest. Life on the ice means living with other researchers in tight living space. Most people sleep in dorm style rooms. More remote field camps use separate tents. So, at least some researchers don't have to _ annoying snorers . But what do they do for fun in their spare time?  There are actually a lot of things they can do. They watch movies, read tons of books, listen to music, have saunas ,paint and ski. Some female researchers might even do some knitting. It is important for a polar researcher to be in good physical condition. They can be required to climb to heights of more than 3, 000 meters. And the Antarctic atmosphere has less oxygen than that of any other continent. The best title of the passage is   _  .", "subject": ""}

Why is it a crime to take certain drugs but it's acceptable to take others? Why is it wrong to create human embryos   to cure diseases suffered by millions? Often, we follow rules that bring little benefit and can even be positively harmful. But the rules are not set in stone, so there is nothing to stop us getting rid of those that don't work and putting better ones in their place. Now an experiment suggests that morality isn't entirely about benefits to individuals. We also tend to make and obey arbitrary moral rules, probably as a way of promoting social consolidation  . A classic psychology experiment called \"trolley   experiment\" suggests that our minds have two moral systems, and they don't always agree. In the trolley experiment, participants are told that an out-of-control trolley could kill five people on the tracks. They must decide whether to turn it onto a second track with only one person on it. Almost everyone does it, sacrificing one to save five. But if instead you have to push one person off a bridge onto the track to stop the trolley, most people say no. That suggests most of us have a strict rule against killing people directly, even for the greater good. How are such rules formed? Although people with morality appear to  _ the act of killing in the bridge experiment, most moral behavior in animals appears focused on outcomes--the death of an individual, say--rather than the death of the majority. When an animal experiences harm to help a  , biologists view this as increasing the chances that the animal's genes will survive. Many psychologists think that human moral rules are an extension of this \"kin   selection\". Kurzban of the University of Pennsylvania did the experiment further. Kurzban's team gave volunteers changes of the bridge situation. Volunteers were asked what they would do and whether their actions were morally right. 85% of them said it would be morally wrong to push one person off to save five, whether these people are brothers or strangers, confirming the idea that there is a rule against killing. However, despite thinking it wrong, 28% said they would still push a stranger off to save five, while 47% said they would push a brother off to save five brothers. \"They're more likely to do this 'less moral1thing if it's to save a  ,\" Kurzban says, suggesting kin selection is at work as well as the basic \"moral rule\" against killing.

In this essay I will examine what turns individuals into a community, and discuss some different types. I will also look at what all communities have in common, the benefits they offer and draw conclusions about their increasing importance. The word \"community\" may make you think of traditional communities in the developing world, where large families live together. We may also imagine the neighbours as people who are happy to help out whenever it is needed. The stereotypical  view is that of a village, where people have little but can feel very rich because everyone takes responsibility for the welfare of the others. On the other hand, there are other types of communities: ultramodern  ones, where the community members are unlikely to have actually met each other. These are online communities, where people blog or chat about particular issues that are important to them. They come across others on websites and may develop a relationship there with like-minded people, discussing the same topics. The view is often that these are artificial connections between people who are, in fact, still isolated  strangers. In reality, the connections are real. Moreover, there are many types of communities in between these extremes: people who join clubs, who sign up with voluntary, political or other organizations, or who take part in group discussions in their local area. They may be campaigning about issues or simply getting together for companionship and support. Human beings are social by nature, so it should not be a surprise that we organize ourselves in groups.

With help from their parents, children can learn techniques  to improve their reading skills. \"A lot of parents think after their child learns to read, they should stop reading to them,\" Donna George said. \"They are sadly mistaken.\" George offers her services to parents at the Title I Learning Centers. She said reading aloud to children may be the most valuable  thing parents can do. \"It is better for children to hear things at a higher level than where they are,\" George said. \"Parents are their child's first teacher.\" Parents help their children build listening, phonics , comprehension  and vocabulary skills when they read aloud to them. Before parents can identify reading problems, they should escape the enemy----television and limit the time their children spend watching television. George suggested not allowing kids to have a TV in their bedrooms, setting a schedule of when kids can watch or keeping a list of how many programs children watch.

With help from their parents, children can learn techniques  to improve their reading skills. \"A lot of parents think after their child learns to read, they should stop reading to them,\" Donna George said. \"They are sadly mistaken.\" George offers her services to parents at the Title I Learning Centers. She said reading aloud to children may be the most valuable  thing parents can do. \"It is better for children to hear things at a higher level than where they are,\" George said. \"Parents are their child's first teacher.\" Parents help their children build listening, phonics , comprehension  and vocabulary skills when they read aloud to them. Before parents can identify reading problems, they should escape the enemy----television and limit the time their children spend watching television. George suggested not allowing kids to have a TV in their bedrooms, setting a schedule of when kids can watch or keeping a list of how many programs children watch.

It's not clear whether those lost students this year will return next year, or if it's a storm warming of a worrying trend.\" But the commission's report says there does not seem to be an impact on poorer communities. The commission found there was no significant change in the application rate to the key universities, such as Oxford or Cambridge. The decline  in England has not been mirrored  in other parts of the UK where fees have not been raised, and the drop can only partly be explained by falling numbers of young people in the population. Students from Scotland attending Scottish universities do not pay fees, while the Welsh Assembly says it will pay fees above PS3,465 for Welsh students attending UK institutions.

{"answer": 1, "choices": ["Faithful and brave", "Diligent and adventurous", "Polite but naughty", "Imaginative but proud"], "question": "Retold by Laura E.Richards All day long the little boy had worked hard, in the field and barn and shed, for his parents were poor farmers, and could not pay a workman.But at sunset there came an hour that was all his own, for his father had given it to him.Then the boy would go up to the top of a hill and look across at another hill that rose some miles away.On that far hill stood a house with windows of clear gold and diamonds.They shone so brightly that it made the boy squint at them,  but after a while the people in the house put up shutters, as it seemed, and then it looked like any common farmhouse.The boy supposed they did this because it was suppertime; and then he would go into the house and have his supper of bread and milk, and go to bed. One day the boy's father called him and said: \"You have been a good boy, and have earned a holiday.Take this day for your own, and try to learn some good things.\" The boy thanked his father and kissed his mother.Then he put a piece of bread in his pocket, and started off to find the house with the golden windows. It was a pleasant walk.His bare feet made marks in the white dust, and when he looked back, the footprints seemed to be following him, and keeping him company.His shadow, too, kept beside him, and would dance or run with him as he pleased; so it was very cheerful.By and by he felt hungry, and he sat down by a brown stream that ran through the alder hedge by the roadside, ate his bread, and drank the clear water.Then he scattered the small pieces of bread for the birds as his mother had taught him to do, and went on his way. After a long time he came to a high green hill, and when he had climbed the hill, there was the house on the top.But it seemed that the shutters were up, for he could not see the golden windows.He came up to the house, and then he could well have wept, for the windows were of clear glass, like any others, and there was no gold anywhere about them. A woman came to the door, looked kindly at the boy, and asked him what he wanted. \"I saw the golden windows from our hilltop,\" he said, \"and I came to see them, but now they are only of clear glass.\" The woman shook her head and laughed. \"We are poor farmers,\" she said, \"and are not likely to have gold about our windows.But glass is better to see through.\" She let the boy sit down on the broad stone step at the door, and brought him a cup of milk and a cake, and asked him to take a break.Then she called her daughter, a child of his own age, nodded kindly at the two, and went back to her work. The little girl was barefooted like him, and wore a brown cotton dress, but her hair was golden like the windows he had seen, and her eyes were blue like the sky at noon.She showed the boy about the farm, and showed him her black calf with a white star on its forehead, and he told her about his own at home, which was red like a chestnut with four white feet.They became friends after they ate an apple together.However, when the boy asked her about the golden windows, the little girl nodded, and said she knew all about them; only he had mistaken the house. \"You have come quite the wrong way!\" she said.\"Come with me, and I will show you the house with the golden windows, and then you will see for yourself.\" They went to a knoll that rose behind the farmhouse, and the little girl told him that the golden windows could only be seen at a certain hour, about sunset. \"Yes, I know that!\" said the boy. When they reached the top of the knoll, the girl turned and pointed;there on a hill far away stood a house with windows of clear gold and diamond, just as he had seen them.And when they looked again, the boy saw that it was his own home. Then he told the little girl that he must go.He gave her his best pebble , the white one with the red band, that he had carried for a year in his pocket, and she gave him three horse-chestnuts, one red like satin, one spotted, and one white like milk.He promised to come again, but he did not tell her what he had learned.He went back down the hill, and the little girl stood in the sunset light and watched him away. The way home was long, and it was dark before the boy reached his house, but the lamplight and firelight shone through the windows, making them almost as bright as he had seen them from the hilltop.When he opened the door, his mother came to kiss him, and his little sister ran to throw her arms about his neck, and his father looked up and smiled from his seat by the fire. \"Have you had a good day?\" asked his mother.

After a long time he came to a high green hill, and when he had climbed the hill, there was the house on the top.But it seemed that the shutters were up, for he could not see the golden windows.He came up to the house, and then he could well have wept, for the windows were of clear glass, like any others, and there was no gold anywhere about them. A woman came to the door, looked kindly at the boy, and asked him what he wanted. \"I saw the golden windows from our hilltop,\" he said, \"and I came to see them, but now they are only of clear glass.\" The woman shook her head and laughed. \"We are poor farmers,\" she said, \"and are not likely to have gold about our windows.But glass is better to see through.\" She let the boy sit down on the broad stone step at the door, and brought him a cup of milk and a cake, and asked him to take a break.Then she called her daughter, a child of his own age, nodded kindly at the two, and went back to her work. The little girl was barefooted like him, and wore a brown cotton dress, but her hair was golden like the windows he had seen, and her eyes were blue like the sky at noon.She showed the boy about the farm, and showed him her black calf with a white star on its forehead, and he told her about his own at home, which was red like a chestnut with four white feet.They became friends after they ate an apple together.However, when the boy asked her about the golden windows, the little girl nodded, and said she knew all about them; only he had mistaken the house. \"You have come quite the wrong way!\" she said.\"Come with me, and I will show you the house with the golden windows, and then you will see for yourself.\" They went to a knoll that rose behind the farmhouse, and the little girl told him that the golden windows could only be seen at a certain hour, about sunset. \"Yes, I know that!\" said the boy. When they reached the top of the knoll, the girl turned and pointed;there on a hill far away stood a house with windows of clear gold and diamond, just as he had seen them.And when they looked again, the boy saw that it was his own home. Then he told the little girl that he must go.He gave her his best pebble , the white one with the red band, that he had carried for a year in his pocket, and she gave him three horse-chestnuts, one red like satin, one spotted, and one white like milk.He promised to come again, but he did not tell her what he had learned.He went back down the hill, and the little girl stood in the sunset light and watched him away. The way home was long, and it was dark before the boy reached his house, but the lamplight and firelight shone through the windows, making them almost as bright as he had seen them from the hilltop.When he opened the door, his mother came to kiss him, and his little sister ran to throw her arms about his neck, and his father looked up and smiled from his seat by the fire. \"Have you had a good day?\" asked his mother. Yes, the boy had had a very good day. \"And have you learned anything?\" asked his father. \"Yes!\" said the boy.\"I have learned that our house has windows of gold and diamond.\" The author's main purpose in including the character of the girl in this story is   _  .", "subject": ""}

But a growing body of research is raising questions about how a child's lie is different from an adult's lie, and how the way we _ changes as we grow. \"Parents and teachers who catch their children lying should not be alarmed. Their children are not going to turn out to be abnormal liars,\" says Dr. Lee, a professor at the University of Toronto and director of the Institute of Child Study. He has spent the last 15 years studying how lying changes as kids get older, why some people lie more than others as well as which factors can reduce lying. The fact that children tell lies is a sign that they have reached a new developmental stage. Dr. Lee conducted a series of studies in which they bring children into a lab with hidden cameras. Children and young adults aged 2 to 17 are likely to lie while being told not to look at a toy, which is put behind the child's back. Whether or not the child takes a secret look is caught on tape. For young kids, the desire to cheat is big and 90% take a secret look in these experiments. When the test-giver returns to the room, the child is asked if he or she looked secretly. At age 2, about a quarter of children will lie and say they didn't. By 3, half of kids will lie, and by 4, that figure is 90%, studies show. Researchers have found that it's kids with better understanding abilities who lie more. That's because to lie you also have to keep the truth in mind, which includes many brain processes, such as combining several sources of information and faking that information. The ability to lie -- and lie successfully  -- is thought to be related to development of brain regions that allow so called \"executive functioning\", or higher order thinking and reasoning abilities. Kids who perform better on tests that involve executive functioning also lie more. What's the purpose of children telling lies?", "subject": ""}

He also worked diligently as a factory laborer and country pastor. He was a good neighbor and well-respected for honoring his word. When harvest time came, he'd piece together his old one-row corn picker and oil it up for the season. All his life he worked hard, helped others, and you could count on him to keep his promises. He had promised to harvest a few ribbons of corn on a friend's farm, but after harvesting his own corn, Grandpa's little corn picker coughed and quit. It would be out of commission until a particular part could be ordered, but that would take far too long to help this year. The factory where Grandpa worked began to require overtime. In order to keep his job there he had to leave the farm before dawn and get home until well after sunset.  One autumn night, while harvest time was running out, he and his wife sat at the kitchen table and trying to figure a way out of their dilemma. \"There's nothing you can do,\" said my grandma. \"You'll just have to tell him that you can't help with the corn this year.\" \"Well that just doesn't sit well with me,\" said my grandpa. \"My friend is depending on me.

The weather was cold but clear, and the moon was brilliant. He worked through the night to keep his word.

American researchers say the disease will affect more than one hundred million people worldwide by the year twenty fifty. That would be four times the current number. Researchers and doctors have been studying Alzheimer's patients for a century. Yet the cause and the cure for the mental sickness are still unknown. However, some researchers have made important steps towards understanding it. Several early signs of the disease involve memory and thought processes. At first, patients have trouble remembering little things. Later, they have trouble remembering more important things, such as the names of their children. There are also some physical tests that might show who is at risk of developing Alzheimer's disease. The tests look for proteins in brain and spinal cord  fluid. The proteins appear to be found only in people with the disease. The protein tests correctly identify the presence of the disease in about ninety percent of patients. Now, a much simpler physical test to predict Alzheimer's risk has been developed. Researchers found that trouble with the sense of smell can be one of the first signs of Alzheimer's. Using this information, they developed a test in which people were asked to identify twelve familiar smells. These smells included cinnamon, black pepper, chocolate, paint thinner, and smoke. The study continued for five years. During this period, the same people were asked to take several tests measuring their memory and thought abilities. Fifty percent of those who could not identify at least four of the smells in the first test had trouble with their memory and thinking in the next five years. Another study has shown a possible way to reduce a person's chances of developing Alzheimer's disease in old age. Researchers in Chicago found that people who use their brains more often are less likely to develop Alzheimer's disease. Those who read a newspaper, or play chess or word games are about three times less likely to develop the condition. Researchers say they still do not know what causes Alzheimer's disease.

In some homes, they were behind a curtain or screen, in a separate part of the house or even outside.   A lot of men used macassar oil to slick back their hair. In order to stop this grease from sticking to the furniture, pieces of material called antimacassars were placed over the backs of chairs.   For a lady, to show her ankles was considered taboo . ks5u   Many people kept a hedgehog  in the basement so it could eat insects.

Soon the benefits may be more widespread.  A 25-year-old man unable to move from the neck down recently did what many assumed impossible. After a knife attack that had left him paralyzed, all he could move was his head, which he used to push a switch and call for a nurse. And he could turn his wheelchair by blowing into a straw near his face. That was it.  Then last June, a Foxborough (Mass.) company called Cyber Kinetics opened the man's skull and inserted a special chip no larger than a baby aspirin. That insert has given him a few additional and precious abilities. When connected to a special computer via a cable, the chip translates the young man's thoughts into commands that let him move a cursor across a PC screen and open e-mail. He can draw a circle with a computer painting program. And he can use a robotic hook  to perform simple tasks like picking up a candy and sliding it across a table. All he has to do is to think.  Several new studies have begun or been completed in the past year. In fact, more than half of the scientific papers in this field, called brain-to-computer interaction (BCI), have been published in the past two years, notes Jonathan Wolpaw, a research physician at Wadsworth Center, the New York State Health Dept.'s research laboratory.  Brain surgeries   are no longer rare: Thousands of Parkinson's disease patients have had special devices inserted in their brains to ease uncontrollable shaking and other symptoms. The inserts themselves have improved, so the body doesn't reject them as furiously . And significant development has been achieved in software used to interpret the brain's signals and change them into commands understood by computers.  But increased demand for thought technology remains the biggest reason for the field's progress. Today, 4 million Americans live with paralysis according to the Christopher Reeve Paralysis Foundation.  Scientists hope that thought technology will reduce the impact of such disabilities. People with spinal-cord injuries, for example, often lose their ability to walk because the communications network between their brain and their legs has been interrupted. The brain still commands the leg muscles to move, but they don't hear its orders.  Thought technology, scientists hope, will bridge this communications gap. \"Our goal is for you to see paralyzed people eating at a restaurant and for you not to know that they are paralyzed,\" says John Donoghue, founder and chief scientific officer at Cyber Kinetics.

But increased demand for thought technology remains the biggest reason for the field's progress. Today, 4 million Americans live with paralysis according to the Christopher Reeve Paralysis Foundation.  Scientists hope that thought technology will reduce the impact of such disabilities. People with spinal-cord injuries, for example, often lose their ability to walk because the communications network between their brain and their legs has been interrupted. The brain still commands the leg muscles to move, but they don't hear its orders.  Thought technology, scientists hope, will bridge this communications gap. \"Our goal is for you to see paralyzed people eating at a restaurant and for you not to know that they are paralyzed,\" says John Donoghue, founder and chief scientific officer at Cyber Kinetics.

{"answer": 1, "choices": ["Communications gap", "Thought technology", "Brain surgeries", "Human brains"], "question": "A chip inserted in a young quadriplegic's   brain is already improving his quality of life. Soon the benefits may be more widespread.  A 25-year-old man unable to move from the neck down recently did what many assumed impossible. After a knife attack that had left him paralyzed, all he could move was his head, which he used to push a switch and call for a nurse. And he could turn his wheelchair by blowing into a straw near his face. That was it.  Then last June, a Foxborough (Mass.) company called Cyber Kinetics opened the man's skull and inserted a special chip no larger than a baby aspirin. That insert has given him a few additional and precious abilities. When connected to a special computer via a cable, the chip translates the young man's thoughts into commands that let him move a cursor across a PC screen and open e-mail. He can draw a circle with a computer painting program. And he can use a robotic hook  to perform simple tasks like picking up a candy and sliding it across a table. All he has to do is to think.  Several new studies have begun or been completed in the past year. In fact, more than half of the scientific papers in this field, called brain-to-computer interaction (BCI), have been published in the past two years, notes Jonathan Wolpaw, a research physician at Wadsworth Center, the New York State Health Dept.'s research laboratory.  Brain surgeries   are no longer rare: Thousands of Parkinson's disease patients have had special devices inserted in their brains to ease uncontrollable shaking and other symptoms. The inserts themselves have improved, so the body doesn't reject them as furiously .

Social networking has been in existence for at least 150 years, and probably longer than that. In the times before the invention of the computer and the World Wide Web (WWW), social networking was done in person. People who had similar likes and interests would gather together to share experiences, make new friends, and improve their businesses. On the Internet, social networking websites made their first appearances during the late 1990s. The first major social networking website in the United States was MySpace. MySpace allowed its users to exchange messages, share pictures, and make new friends in a way that was never thought of in the past. With MySpace, people who did not go out much could reach out to others from their own homes. In 2004, Facebook was created. It was first a website created for use by Harvard University's students and teachers, but it soon expanded to include just about everyone. It is now larger than some of the largest companies in the world. It is a website that is changing all the time. Facebook has completely changed the way people stay connected with each other and the rest of the world. The way it works is simple. Users can set up a new account   easily.

She felt alone and hopeless. Then she went into the kitchen and grabbed what she needed before going back up to her room quietly. She switched on the TV and started eating...and eating...for hours, until it was all gone. What Emily didn't know at the time was that she was suffering from an illness called binge-eating disorder(BED) . For years, Emily didn't tell anyone what she was doing. She felt ashamed, alone, and out of control. Why don't famous people confess   to BED, as they do to _ ? It's simple: There's a stigma involved. \"Overeating is seen as very bad, but dieting to be skinny is seen as positive and even associated with determination,\" says Charles Sophy, a doctor in Beverly Hills , California. \"Some parents or friends may look at a teen with BED and think, 'Oh, a good diet and some will-power will do the trick.' But that's not true,\" says Dr.Ovidio Bermudez , a baby doctor at the Eating Recovery Center in Denver. \"Eating disorders are real physical and mental health issues; it's not about willpower.\" The focus in treating BED shouldn't be on weight, because as with all eating disorders, the behaviors with food are a symptom of something deeper. Like most other diseases, genetics may play a big part in who gets BED and who doesn't. If you have a close relative with an eating disorder, that means you're more likely to develop an eating disorder of your own. Besides, many people with BED have tried at some point or another to control it by going on a diet, but paying more attention to food doesn't help. And it might even make things worse, like it did for Carla, who's 15 now and is recovering from BED. \"My parents would always tease me about my weight, so when I was 14, I went on a very restrictive diet,\" she says.

They call be surprisingly vivid and real,or fragmented and weird.They can be comforting or frightening.Our dreams can tell us a lot about what we are really thinking.Dreams give us an x-ray of our unconsciousness .They tell us,particularly when we are at life's passages or turning points. Lisa Oppenheim had the same dream whenever she was about to move to a new home or a new city.It's always just a feeling of needing to stay safe.Experts say disturbing dreams often occur around major life events.For Lisa,it was moving.For others,it can be marriage or divorce,the death of a loved one or pressure at work. Doctor Siegel has studied the meaning of dream for nearly 30 years.He believes stressful or upsetting dreams can be a sign of what's buried deep inside our minds. He said.\"Dreams are important to survival.They are crucial to the balance of our psyche .They help us work out problems that we're having every single day.They go to the cutting edge of what's stressful,what's bothering us and what we're working out in our lives.Dreams can guide us and in order to find that guidance,to find that deep source of wisdom that's in our dreams every night,we need to pay attention to our dreams.\" But many dreams are scary and horrible.How can we understand these nightmares? Doctor Siegel says they are reflecting especially intense emotion or unresolved conflict.The stronger the emotion in the dream,whether it's pleasure or fear,the likelier the dream is to be important. Knowing what your recurring dreams or nightmares mean can be liberating.Some nightmares can be a sign of serious psychological problems,such as post-dramatic stress disorder.If they are extremely disturbing or violent or the cause of severe anxiety,you should see a professional therapist .

Deluca was managing the store and to the University of Bridgeport at the same time. Buck was working at his day job as a nuclear physicist in New York. They'd meet Monday evenings and brainstorm ideas for keeping the business running. \"We convinced ourselves to open a second store. We figured we could tell the public, 'We are so successful; we are opening a second store.'\" And they did--in the spring of 1966. Still, it was a lot of learning by trial and error.

They have seasonal migration   routes. As human populations rise, elephant land is being cleared for agriculture and other kinds of development.  When animals are effectively trapped on small areas of land, it restricts the gene pool and also results in a shortage of food. Where elephant reserves   border agricultural areas, elephants are often attracted to leave parks to attack crops and barns. Only the strongest walls will stop an adult elephant (males can weigh 6,000kg), so farmers have great difficulty protecting their fields. In prefix = st1 /India, elephants don't only attack for food.

Gregory began his life as a sculptor.But he often felt that his sculptures.Which just stood in rich people's houses for years,lacked a meaningful purpose.So in 201l he decided to put his artistic energies into creating homes to sell--not ordinary homes but small structures built entirely from recycled materials. The thought of creating homes for the homeless didn't occur to him until the year 2013,when a homeless couple asked him for a tarp .Instead of a tarp,Gregory offered them something better:a small home with a water tank, a kitchen and a trap for waste.They were so grateful that Gregory decided to focus his efforts on helping house the homeless population in his city.And soon his\"Homeless Homes Project\"was started. Before starting a new home,Gregory,goes hunting for materials by digging through dustbins.Everything he finds is usable--refrigerator doors become house doors;washing machine doors often serve as windows,and the tops of cars become strong roofs.He put wheels at the bottom for users to move their homes around easily.Each home takes two to three days to make. So far Gregory has donated dozens of homes to the city's most needy.While his small low- cost mobile homes are not the final solution to the problem of homelessness,they are really practical and do provide a warm and safe place for the homeless to stay in.They are simply a way for one man to do something nice for those in need of some help. Gregory has written a book titled Homeless Architecture,where he explains techniques to build those homes and he is now working on weekend workshops.\"A lot of people who hear about what I'm doing want to get involved,\"he said.\"Maybe we can meet someplace and put a couple of homes together.\" Why did Gregory turn from making sculptures to creating homes?", "subject": ""}

With babies, even a little movement can show big results. Margaret Barnes, a pediatrician  , believes in the importance of exercise. She thinks that many learning disabilities that children have in elementary school or high school can be traced back to a lack of movement as babies. \"Babies need movement that stimulates their five senses.

I seek friends whose qualities illuminate   me and train me up for love. It is for these people that I reserve the glowing hours, too good not to share. When I was in the eighth grade, I had a friend. We were shy and \"too serious\" about our studies when it was becoming fashionable with our classmates to learn acceptable social behaviors. We said little at school, but she would come to my house and we would sit down with pencils and paper, and one of us would say: \"Let's start with a train whistle today.\" We would sit quietly together and write separate poems or stories that grew out of a train whistle. Then we would read them aloud. At the end of that school year, we, too, were changing into social creatures and the stories and poems stopped. When I lived for a time in London, I had a friend. He was in despair and I was in despair. But our friendship was based on the idea in each of us that we would be sorry later if we did not explore this great city because we had felt bad at the time.

{"answer": 0, "choices": ["were free from depression", "were fond of using the media", "attached much importance to their health", "could afford the time for the long-term survey"], "question": "A new study suggests that the more teenagers watch television, the more likely they are to develop depression   as young adults.But the extent to how much TV may be to blame is a question that the study leaves unanswered. The researchers used a national long-term survey of adolescent health to look into the relationship between media use and depression.They based their findings on more than 4,000 adolescents who were not depressed when the survey began in 1995. As part of the survey, the young people were asked how many hours of television or videos they watched daily.They were also asked how often they played computer games and listened to the radio. Media use totaled an average of 5 and one half hours a day.More than 2 hours of that was spent watching TV. 7 years later, in 2002, more than 7 percent of the young people had signs of depression.The average age at that time was 21. Brian Primack at the University of Pittsburgh medical school was the lead author of the new study.He says every extra hour of television meant an 8 percent increase in the chances of developing signs of depression. The researchers say they did not find any such relationship with the use of other media such as movies, video games or radio.But the study did find that young men were more likely than young women to develop depression given the same amount of media use.

The researchers used a national long-term survey of adolescent health to look into the relationship between media use and depression.They based their findings on more than 4,000 adolescents who were not depressed when the survey began in 1995. As part of the survey, the young people were asked how many hours of television or videos they watched daily.They were also asked how often they played computer games and listened to the radio. Media use totaled an average of 5 and one half hours a day.More than 2 hours of that was spent watching TV. 7 years later, in 2002, more than 7 percent of the young people had signs of depression.The average age at that time was 21. Brian Primack at the University of Pittsburgh medical school was the lead author of the new study.He says every extra hour of television meant an 8 percent increase in the chances of developing signs of depression. The researchers say they did not find any such relationship with the use of other media such as movies, video games or radio.But the study did find that young men were more likely than young women to develop depression given the same amount of media use.

Let me first refresh your memory: You, a group of fit, young men, were playing soccer on the field across from my apartment building. I, a better-than-average looking young woman, was walking along the sidewalk with my groceries. That's when your ball came flying over the fence and landed in front of me. One of you approached and asked politely if I would throw the ball back to you. Fighting the urge to drop my bags and run screaming down the street, I reluctantly   agreed. Before I continue, let me explain something that I didn't have a chance to mention last night: I hate sports. More specifically, I hate sports involving balls. This results from my lack of natural ability when it comes to throwing, catching and hitting. I'm bad at aiming too.

Trying to act casually, I said something about being out of practice, and then picked up the ball again. If you'll remember, at your command, I agreed to try throwing underhand. While outwardly I was smiling, in my head, I was praying, oh God, oh please oh please oh please. I threw the ball upward with all my strength, terrified by what happened next. The ball hit slightly higher up on the fence and bounced back to me. This is the point where I start to take issue with you.

Although a sense of happiness remains a luxury for many of our countrymen because of poverty, we agree wealth is not the only factor of happiness. For most of us, except the extremely rich and naturally born optimists, there simply are too many variables   that may kill the feeling of happiness.

Of course, it is possible. You can communicate your moods and intentions to one another without words, because all human beings share a lot of common visual signals. These signals are as effective as words during communication. The gestures of the head play a key role in body language. The movements of eyes and eyebrows are as important as head movements in body language. Besides the gestures of the head or the movements of the eyes and eyebrows, the action of arms, hands and legs is also a large part of body language. Extending one's arm and shaking hands with others is a greeting in both formal and informal cases. This part of body language might date back to primary tribes . Like handshaking, there are still many other forms of body language presented by hands. Raising one's hand and making a circle with his thumb and for finger signals, that something is OK. Clasped hands raised above the head, a traditional picture accepted by sportsmen after winning a fight, is a display of triumph that grows out of a kind of feeling following a victory. Waving one's hands, a speaker can make his words more powerful and vigorous . Besides hand gestures, there are times when a person says something with his legs as well as with his head and eyes. The leg gestures often reflect one's attitude towards something or someone that person is with.

The larger the number of workers in an industry who are women, the lower the average wages. Why do women earn less than men? Are the differences explained by the fact that women are looked down upon? If so, the government has to intervene, to force the employers to pay equal wages to equal jobs. however, there is no agreement among economists about the causes of the gap. One view argues that women on the average have chosen low-paying jobs in which workers enjoy the freedom of entering and leaving the labor force, which reduces their years of experience relative to men.

Star programmer Howard Warshaw created it with consultation from the film director Steven Spielberg. It was July 27th, 1982. Howard Warshaw was hot off the success of his most recent game, Raiders of the Lost Ark. He received a call from Atari C.E.O, Ray Kassar. Atari had bought the rights to make a video game version of Spilberg's Movie, E.T., which had just been released  in June. Kassar told Warshaw that Spielberg had specifically asked for Warshaw to make the game Warshaw was honored, but there was one huge problem. Atari needed the game finished by September 1stin order to start selling it during the Christmas season. It had taken Warshaw six months to create Raiders of the Lost Ark. The game he made prior to that took him seven months. He was expected to create E.T. in around five weeks. Warshaw accepted the challenge anyway and production began. Spielberg wanted Warshaw to create a simple maze game similar to Pac-man, but V had a bigger vision. He wanted players to explore different environments in 3D world. Usually companies like Atari have people test games before releasing them, but they decided to skip testing due to time limitations. The game was a hot holiday item at first. Unfortunately, Atari overestimated how many they would sell. They made 5 million copies and they only sold 1.5 million. Most people who played the game hated it. The graphics were bad. Game play was awkward. Players got stuck in holes that they couldn't escape. Some people who stuck with the game grew to like it, but it wasn't the mainstream success that Atari had hoped it would be. Too many copies of the game sat on store shelves. One employee remembers the game being discounted five times, from $49.95 to less than a dollar. A newspaper in New Mexico reported that between 10 and 20 semitrailer truckloads of Atari products were crushed and buried at landfill in Alamogordo. Atari lost over $100 million on E.T..

{"answer": 0, "choices": ["Different kinds of allergy tests.", "A new allergy test that works very well.", "When children should be tested for allergies.", "How allergy tests have changed over time."], "question": "Just one bite of cake that is made with eggs is enough to make John feel very sick. Susan gets a terrible rash whenever she eats anything containing seafood, and David nearly died when he first ate a cookie that included peanuts. David had trouble breathing after he ate the cookie, but his mother knew what to do and she quickly gave him medicine that helped him feel better almost right away. The body's reaction to certain foods can be quite severe, resulting in breathing problems, as in David's case, or loss of consciousness for some. There are many things we eat may cause our bodies to react badly if we have a food allergy . The most common food allergies seem to be related to milk, soy, eggs, wheat flour, peanuts, nuts, and seafood. In fact, these kinds of foods account for 90% of food allergies. According to some studies, the number of children who have a food allergy is growing. But some people now argue that test results might not actually be accurate, so food allergies are not really as common as they may appear. There are three typical ways that doctors test for food allergies. Probably the most accurate way is for a doctor to give a child a  food challenge\", For this, the doctor watches the child eat small amounts of certain foods to see if the child has an allergic reaction or not. This method is very time consuming so it is used less often than the other two methods: skin tests and blood tests. In a skin test, a doctor puts very small amounts of the parts of the foods that the child may be allergic to under the child's skin, then watches to see if the child's skin reacts to the allergens . In a blood test, doctors take some of the child's blood and add possible allergens to it and then look for chemicals in the blood that indicate a possible allergic reaction. A problem with both the skin test and the blood test is that neither will show how severe an allergic reaction might be. If a test result is positive, the child may have a severe reaction by eating this food, but the child might just as likely only have a slight rash. The test will not show which of these might be the case. Dr. Jennifer Chafen of Stanford University studied 10 years' worth of allergy research to check how accurate the tests are. She found a surprising fact. Skin tests or blood tests given to patients who visited their doctors for treatment of rashes or stomachaches showed that these patients were allergic to certain foods. However, later tests showed that although these patients tested positive, fewer than 50 percent of them actually had blood allergies. So were the results false and can we rely on these test results?  The problem might be food intolerance rather than a food allergy. While foodallergies are mainly related to a person's immune system, food intolerance is related to a person's digestive system and the reaction is usually less severe. One of the most common kinds of food intolerance is related to people who have trouble digesting the sugar in products like milk, cheese, and ice cream. Doctors are not sure why the number of cases of food allergies is rising. One factor that may explain part of the problem is our cleaner environment. Most children are exposed to fewer germs these days and some researchers think that for some people, their body's immune system makes work for itself by reacting as if certain foods are harmful. While allergy test results may show false positive results, the tests are still useful and can save lives. Some children lose their food allergies as they get older, so even though doctors do not have a cure for food allergies, sometimes the body finds its own cure.

Starting in early 2011, visitors to NYTimes.com will get a certain number of articles free every month before being asked to pay a standard and fixed fee for unlimited access. Subscribers to the newspaper's print edition will receive full access to the site. But executives of The New York Times Company said they could not yet answer fundamental questions about the plan, like how much it would cost or what the limit would be on free reading. They stressed that the amount of free access could change with time, in response to economic conditions and reader demand. Still, publishers fear that money from digital subscriptions would not make up for the resulting loss of audience and advertising income. NYTimes.com is by far the most popular newspaper site in the country, with more than 17 million readers a month in the United States, according to Nielsen Online, and analysts say it is the leader in advertising income, as well. That may make it better positioned than other general-interest papers to charge--and also gives The Times more to lose if the move produces an opposed result. The Times Company has been studying the matter for almost a year, searching for common ground between pro-and-anti pay campaigns--a debate mirrored in dozens of media-watching blogs-- and the system will not go into effect until January 2011.

Recent research from Germany and Italy shows that heart attacks are more common on Monday mornings and doctors blame the stress of returning to work after the weekend break. The risk of having a heart attack on any given day should be one in seven, but a six-year study helped by researchers at the Free University of Berlin of more than 2,600 Germans showed that the average person had a 20 per cent higher chance of having a heart attack on a Monday than on any other day. Working Germans are particularly not protected against attack, with a 33 per cent higher risk at the beginning of the working week. Non-workers, by comparison, appear to be no more at risk on a Monday than any other day. A study of 11,000 Italians proved 8 am on a Monday morning as the most stressful time for the heart, and both studies showed that Sunday is the least stressful day, with fewer heart attacks in both countries. The findings could lead to a better understanding of what is the immediate cause of heart attacks, according to Dr Stefan Willich of the Free University. \"We know a lot about long-term risk factors such as smoking and cholesterol but we don't know what actually causes heart attacks, so we can't give clear advice on how to prevent them,\" he said. Monday mornings have a double helping of stress for the working body as it makes a rapid change from sleep to activity, and from the relaxing weekend to the pressures of work. \"When people get up, their blood pressure and heart rate go up and there are hormonal changes in their bodies,\" Willich explained. \"All these things can have an unfavourable effect in the blood system and increase the risk of a clot in the arteries which will cause a heart attack.\" \"When people return to work after a weekend off, the pace of their life changes.

A study of 11,000 Italians proved 8 am on a Monday morning as the most stressful time for the heart, and both studies showed that Sunday is the least stressful day, with fewer heart attacks in both countries. The findings could lead to a better understanding of what is the immediate cause of heart attacks, according to Dr Stefan Willich of the Free University. \"We know a lot about long-term risk factors such as smoking and cholesterol but we don't know what actually causes heart attacks, so we can't give clear advice on how to prevent them,\" he said. Monday mornings have a double helping of stress for the working body as it makes a rapid change from sleep to activity, and from the relaxing weekend to the pressures of work. \"When people get up, their blood pressure and heart rate go up and there are hormonal changes in their bodies,\" Willich explained. \"All these things can have an unfavourable effect in the blood system and increase the risk of a clot in the arteries which will cause a heart attack.\" \"When people return to work after a weekend off, the pace of their life changes.

Innocent times spent sharing documents and executable files without a care in the world. Okay, every month or so you might encounter a boot sector virus -- but they were easy to deal with even if the anti-virus software didn't pick them up.     But those long lazy summers disappeared too fast. Macro viruses made Information Technology (IT) administrators grow up fast as they realized there was a type of virus which could spread very quickly throughout an organization. It wasn't unusual to find hundreds of computers within personal company infected by viruses transmitted via email attachments. The IT staff were amongst the fittest departments in your company, running from Personal Computer (PC) to the next cleaning them up.         There had to be a better way. Companies now realize that viruses aren't \"urban myths\", and can have a serious impact on their operations. They invest in anti-virus software on the desktops, servers and email gateways and even put in place procedures to ensure their anti-virus is up-to-date with the very latest detection routines.     It sounds like companies have put in place adequate defenses to protect against viruses. But have they? Anti-virus software detects most of the viruses your users are likely to encounter -- often without the user even knowing. However, the software must be updated regularly, preferably daily in any large company. Even then, a very new virus can infect your users. With the rapid transmission of files through networks and the Internet, a virus can spread a considerable distance before it can be identified and protected against. Fortunately, only a few viruses ever do this but the likes of Melissa and the Love Bug can inflict serious damage before their progress is stopped. While employees become suddenly aware during the ensuing media excitement, they soon forget about the virus threat as the stories disappear from the news headlines.        This is the danger. Complacency can set in when there is no perceived \"action\" on the virus front with no global crisis, and the importance of being vigilant about viruses recedes in your users' minds. They forget what the big deal was in the first place -- after all, anti-virus software deals with the viruses, doesn't it? And isn't it the IT department's job to look after this sort of thing?         Before you know it your users are opening unsolicited attachments once more, downloading unauthorized software, and putting your company's data and credibility at risk. All because the users think that they are working in a safe environment. Employees see anti-virus software, firewalls and IT departments as guarantees that their computers will work and be safe. Of course, there aren't any guarantees. Anti-virus software plays one, albeit important, part in the defense of your company from malicious attack but the security of your computer system is only as strong as the weakest link. And that, more often than not, is the human factor.         No employer wants to come across as a killjoy or an ogre. Most will willingly accept that the happiest employees are those who feel that they are respected and trusted by their employer. Many companies accept that employees will send and receive a certain amount of personal email and make the odd personal telephone call.         However, the worry comes when employees start risking company security in pursuit of personal amusement. Funny screensavers and games downloaded from the Internet can seem harmless enough but they could easily be harboring a dangerous virus.     Software downloaded from the net is often unlicensed and unsupported, and may cause conflicts with existing software in use at your company. Unlicensed, pirated software is an ideal vector for a computer virus. Virus writers and hackers often use such software as the ideal \"kick-start\" for their virus distribution. It is vitally important that employees be educated about the virus threat but this cannot be a one-off event. The potential threat should always be in the back of an employee's mind and precautionary measures should be taken as a matter of course. There is no harm in reminding people about what could happen if they let their guard down. In the end, education is the key to a virus-free environment and this is a continual process. It may not be the most exciting thing on the agenda but it works.         The lesson is simple.

A couple of years later, I was living in Jordan. I had just moved into a modern flat and was unpacking plates when I saw something move out of the corner of my eye.

It took me three days before I found the courage to open the bathroom door to see if he was still alive. He wasn't. Why did I react so violently to one lone insect when a closer encounter with hundreds of ants hardly affected me? The answer is easy: because cockroaches are creepy  crawlies and ants aren't. Creepy crawlies are those little bugs which cause feelings such as anxiety - they make your skin crawl. Did you know that some people feel such a fear of bugs that it becomes a phobia ? Psychologists have offered many explanations. Some say we associate them with dirt and disease. Or that these are life forms that are so alien to us, that we find them disgusting for their dissimilarity.

{"answer": 2, "choices": ["were difficult to separate", "could be split into 6 pieces", "were fitted with solid tyres", "were hard to carry on a train"], "question": "Andrew Ritchie, inventor of the Brompton folding bicycle, once said that the perfect portable bike would be \"like a magic carpet...You could fold it up and put it into your pocket or handbag\". Then he paused: \"But you'll always be limited by the size of the wheels. And so far no one has invented a folding wheel.\" It was a rare -- indeed unique -- occasion when I was able to put Ritchie right. A 19th-century inventor, William Henry James Grout, did in fact design a folding wheel. His bike, predictably named the Grout Portable, had a frame that split into two and a larger wheel that could be separated into four pieces. All the bits fitted into Grout's Wonderful Bag, a leather case. Grout's aim: to solve the problems of carrying a bike on a train. Now doesn't that sound familiar? Grout intended to find a way of making a bike small enough for train travel: his bike was a huge beast. And importantly, the design of early bicycles gave him an advantage: in Grout's day, tyres were solid, which made the business of splitting a wheel into four separate parts relatively simple. You couldn't do the same with a wheel fitted with a one-piece inflated   tyre. So, in a 21st-century context, is the idea of the folding wheel dead? It is not. A British design engineer, Duncan Fitzsimons, has developed a wheel that can be squashed into something like a slender ellipse  . Throughout, the tyre remains inflated. Will the young Fitzsimons's folding wheel make it into production? I haven't the foggiest idea. But his inventiveness shows two things. First, people have been saying for more than a century that bike design has reached its limit, except for gradual advances. It's as silly a concept now as it was 100 years ago: there's plenty still to go for. Second, it is in the field of folding bikes that we are seeing the most interesting inventions. You can buy a folding bike for less than PS1,000 that can be knocked down so small that it can be carried on a plane -- minus wheels, of course -- as hand baggage.

{"answer": 1, "choices": ["Running away from the school.", "Losing long-term friendship.", "A specific person's marriage.", "A company's closing down."], "question": "In modern society loneliness can be seen as a social phenomenon and people can experience loneliness for many reasons. It is a very common, though normally temporary, consequence of a breakup, divorce, or loss of any important long-term relationship. In these cases, loneliness may result both from the loss of a specific person or from dropping out of social circles. The loss of a significant person in one's life will typically lead to a grief response; in this situation, one might feel lonely, even while in the company of others. There are many different ways used to treat loneliness. The first step that most doctors recommend to patients is treatment. Short term treatment typically occurs over a period of ten to twenty weeks. During treatment, emphasis is put on understanding the cause of the problem, thoroughly changing the negative thoughts, feelings, and attitudes resulting from the problem, and exploring ways to help the patient feel connected. Some doctors also recommend group treatment a means to connect with other sufferers and establish a support system. Another treatment is animal-assisted treatment. Studies and surveys indicate that the presence of animal companions such as dogs, cats, rabbits, and guinea pigs can ease feelings of loneliness or depression among some sufferers. Beyond the companionship the animal itself provides there may also be increased opportunities for socializing with other pet owners. Results of a study also suggest that correcting improper social cognition   offers the best chance of reducing loneliness. However, loneliness can sometimes play an important role in the creative process. In some people, temporary or prolonged loneliness can lead to remarkable artistic and creative expression, for example, as was the case with poet Emily Dickinson, and many musicians. This is not to imply that loneliness itself ensures this creativity, rather, it may have an influence on the subject matter of the artist and more likely be present in individuals engaged in creative activities.

To be exact, thoughts of the future have kept me up countless nights and made me worry enough to do poorly on more than one test. Because of this, words of wisdom are a source of comfort. Steve Jobs gave a speech to Stanford's graduating class in 2005 and his words resound repeatedly in my mind whenever I think about my future. It wasn't always like that, though. It started when I became a junior, when college came into view. It's the first big step to making your life your own. So when Jobs discussed his life as a student, some fears were eased. He, too, felt the need to attend college to make something of himself. He faced what many are extremely afraid of: uncertainty. His lack of understanding caused him to stop attending college and focus on what he felt was important. His story had a happy ending, of course, since he certainly turned out well. This doesn't mean that students shouldn't attend college, but rather that they shouldn't worry so much. You'll get where you need to go, even if your path is a bit more winding than you'd like. Jobs talked about the hardships in his work. His love of his work helped him carry on and he got where he was meant to be, which restates the point: don't panic.

Phipps found that worriers,those who stress the most,tend to sleep in the fetal position.He found that this is the most common bedtime position,with nearly 58 percent of people sleeping on their side with knees up and head down.The more we curl up ,the more comfort we are seeking,according to Phipps. The second most common position is the log.Sleeping with a straight body,with arms at each side,as if they are standing guard at Buckingham Palace,indicates stubbornness,and these people(the 28 percent who sleep this way)often wake up stiffer than when they went to sleep. \"The longer you sleep like this,the more _ your thinking is and you can become inflexible,which means you make things harder for yourself,\"according to Phipps. Yearner sleepers are next on the list.About 25 percent of people sleep in this style--on their side with arms stretched out in front,looking as if they are either chasing a dream or perhaps being chased themselves.Yearners are typically their own worst critics,always expecting the best results,explained Phipps.These people often wake up refreshed and eager to face the challenges of the day ahead. Perhaps the most peculiar of sleep styles is the freefaller position.This sleep style makes up 17 percent of the population.They sleep face down with arms stretched out.These people,according to Phipps,feel like they have little control over their life.Not only is this the strangest of sleep styles,but also the least comfortable,and people may wake up feeling tired and have no energy. In conclusion,Phipps has only one more thing to add:\"A good night's sleep sets you up for the following day and our sleeping positions can determine how we feel when we wake.\" Which of the following is the best title of the passage?", "subject": ""}

So I opened it up and figured I'd look through it for ten minutes and see what would hit me. Well, 10 minutes turned into 20, 20 into 30 and 30 into a valuable resource that sits on my desk. Not only are the lessons within brief, but they are very easy to understand, well presented and very easy to understand for the beginner. Each lesson comes with tips to point out shortcuts, cautions to help you avoid common mistakes and notes to additional infomation. This book can be used in two ways, as a reference or as a complete tutorial on PHP basics. That alone is something that is very rare in teaching type books these days. Some of the more valuable and informative lessons will take you into the areas of: --Strings and variables --Processing HTML forms --Controlling and filtering data --User authentication --Cookies and sessions --Security practices --Configuring PHP and more!!! The book is pretty basic for experienced PHP coders, but for new or intermediate users this book is worth more than the small $19.99 CAN suggested price.

Tolstoy's Napoleon could be any man wandering in the streets and putting a little of powdered tobacco up his nose-and that is the point. It is a way the novelist uses to show the moral nature of a character. And it turns out that, as Tolstoy has it, Napoleon is a crazy man. In a scene in Book Three of War and Peace, the wars having reached the critical year of 1812,Napoleon receives a representative from the Tsar   ,who has come with peace terms. Napoleon is very angry: doesn't he have more army? He, not the Tsar, is the one to make the terms. He will destroy all of Europe if his army is stopped. \"That is what you will have gained by engaging me in the war!\" he shouts. And then, Tolstoy writes, Napoleon \"walked silently several times up and down the room, his fat shoulders moving quickly\". Still later, after reviewing his army amid cheering crowds, Napoleon invites the shaken Russian to dinner. \"He raised his hand to the Russian's face,\" Tolstoy writes, and \"taking him by the ear pulled it gently. . . \". To have one's ear pulled by the Emperor was considered the greatest honor and mark of favor at the French court. \"Well, well, why don't you say anything?\" said he, as if it was ridiculous in his presence to respect any one but himself, Napoleon.

It is a way the novelist uses to show the moral nature of a character. And it turns out that, as Tolstoy has it, Napoleon is a crazy man. In a scene in Book Three of War and Peace, the wars having reached the critical year of 1812,Napoleon receives a representative from the Tsar   ,who has come with peace terms. Napoleon is very angry: doesn't he have more army? He, not the Tsar, is the one to make the terms. He will destroy all of Europe if his army is stopped. \"That is what you will have gained by engaging me in the war!\" he shouts. And then, Tolstoy writes, Napoleon \"walked silently several times up and down the room, his fat shoulders moving quickly\".

The issue here is not the accuracy of Tolstoy's description-it seems not that far off from historical accounts but his choice of facts: other things that could be said of the man are not said.
