Some of Kipling's earliest and fondest memories are of his and sister Alice's trips to the fruit market with their woman servant, or walking with his parents alongside the sea at night. The beautiful days were to end when in 1871 Rudyard and Alice were sent to school in Southsea, England, to live with Captain Holloway and his wife. She ruled the boarding house with punishment and Kipling was often beaten by her and her son. \"Then the old Captain died, and I was sorry, for he was the only person in that house as far as I can remember who ever threw me a kind word.\" So he wrote in his later books. Kipling soon learned to read and found comfort in literature and poetry. Freedom from the Holloway household was gained when he spent one month a year in London with his mother's kind sister Aunt Georgie and her husband, pre-Raphaelite painter Edward Burne Jones and their children. _  In 1877 Kipling's mother returned to England and collected him so that he could attend the United Services College in Devon.

The carps' presence in such numbers is also harming water quality and killing off sensitive species. Asian carp are strong to jump over barriers such as low dams. They lay hundreds of thousands of eggs at a time and spread into new habitat quickly and easily. Also, flooding has helped the fish expand into previously unattainable water bodies.

A disabled man with no hands who ordered a meal at Cinco cle Mayo Mexican Grill in Douglasville on Sunday afternoon hoped someone might be able to help him eat his lunch. Server Alex Ruiz, 22, was more than happy to help as he sat opposite from the man and helped him enjoy his meal. The heartwarming moment was captured in a photo by one of Ruiz's workmates, Crystal Figueroa. She posted it on the restaurant's Facebook page. \"He's a great person,\" Figuero, 24, whose father manages the restaurant, said. \"He's always so nice, and the fact that he just came out of nowhere and helped a man he doesn't even know have a meal says everything. That just shows the person that he is. One of Figueroa's friends, Reginald Widener, also witnessed the moment and posted the photo on his Facebook page. \"This seriously hit me right in the soul,\" Widener wrote. The waiters did not get the name of the man. He had never eaten in the restaurant before, according to Figueroa.

A woman's place, under normal circumstances, is within the protective environment of the home. Nature has determined that women play caretaker roles, such as wife and mother and homemaker.

The boy seldom talked only feeling excited as she felt looking at her silently. When the girl was talking, a not big or small stone fell down from the building toward the girl's head! At that moment the boy took the girl in his arms so suddenly and so strongly that the girl let out a scream. He meant to protect the gift with his body. But the boy turned over to make his own body downward before they dropped on the ground. As a result, only the girl's hand was smashed by the stone and _  The girl came back to earth and cried with pain, tears weeping up. She thought the saying that \"The husband and the wife are birds in the same forest essentially, but when serious tragedy comes, they will fly separately\" was really not wrong! With this, she straggled and stood up from. the boy's body keeping from the pains and slowly ran away without glancing at the boy. At the time, the boy was calling the girl's name in a weak voice, his lips were already white. He took out his mobile phone and dialed the girl's number, but the girl didn't answer. He dialed again she didn't answer again. For several times, he gave up. But his fingers pressed something on the mobile. At that time, beside the boy, the blood spread slowly, his hand hung and the mobile phone lay in the blood, he had no strength to press the \"SENT\" key yet. The next day, when the girl heard of the news that the boy was being rescued, she ran to the hospital without considering her anger. When she hurried to the hospital, the doctor had already declared his death; the cause of his death was that his lung had lost too much blood. It was because, when the boy meant to protect the girl with his body he found that there was a steel stick under them, so he turned over to make it inset(=\"put\" into) his own body. The boy's mother passed the boy's mobile phone on to the gift. The girl read the message that hadn't been sent: \"Honey, I'm sorry, I still couldn't protect you and made you wound... \"Upon this, the girl couldn't help crying... Please treasure the one you love and believe his or her LOVE! From this passage we can conclude that  _", "subject": ""}

But children, and adults, also care about a very different sort of (un)fairness, namely cheating.Think how many games of snakes and ladders have ended in arguments when one child \"accidentally\" miscounts her moves and another child objects.But this sense of fairness isn't about equality of outcome: games inevitably have winners and losers.Here, fairness is about playing by the rules. Both fairness-as-equality and fairness-as-no-cheating matter.Which is more important: equality or no-cheating? I think the answer is neither.The national lottery , like other lotteries, certainly doesn't make the world more equal: a few people get rich and most people get nothing.Nevertheless, we hope, it is fair --- but what does this mean? The fairness-as-no-cheating viewpoint has a ready answer: a lottery is fair if it is conducted according to the \"rules\".But which rules? None of us has the slightest idea, I suspect.Suppose that buried in the small print at lottery HQ is a rule that forbids people with a particular surname (let's say, Moriarty).So a Ms Moriarty could buy a ticket each week for years without any chance of success.

She'd reasonably feel unfairly treated because  _ . To protest  against unfairness, then, is to make an accusation of bad faith.From this viewpoint, an equal split between the crocodile and the bear seems fair because (normally, at least), it is the only split they would both agree to.But were the girl to learn that the crocodile doesn't like biscuits or that the bear isn't hungry, I suspect she'd think it perfectly fair for one toy to take the whole.Inequality of biscuits (or anything else) isn't necessarily unfair, if both parties are happy.And the unfairness of cheating comes from the same source: we'd never accept that someone else can unilaterally  violate agreements that we have all signed up to. So perhaps the four-year-old's intuitions  about fairness is the beginnings of an understanding of negotiation.With a sense of fairness, people will have to make us acceptable offers (or we'll reject their ultimatums) and stick by the (reasonable) rules, or we'll be on the warpath.So a sense of fairness is crucial to effective negotiation; and negotiation, over toys, treats etc, is part of life.

{"answer": 1, "choices": ["declare the importance of fairness", "suggest how to achieve fairness", "present different attitudes to fairness", "explain why we love fairness"], "question": "A four-year-old girl sees three biscuits divided between a stuffed crocodile and a teddy bear.The crocodile gets two; the bear one.\"Is that fair?\" asks the experimenter.The girl judges that it is not.\"How about now?\" asks the experimenter, breaking the bear's single biscuit in half.The girl cheers up: \"Oh yes, now it's fair.They both have two.\" Strangely, children feel very strongly about fairness, even when they hardly understand it. Adults care about fairness too --- but how much? One way to find out is by using the ultimatum   game, created by economist Werner Guth.Jack is given a pile of money and proposes how it should be divided with Jill.Jill can accept Jack's \"ultimatum\", otherwise the deal is off, and neither gets anything. Suppose Jack and Jill don't care about fairness, just about accumulating cash.Then Jack can offer Jill as little as he likes and Jill will still accept.After all, a little money is more than no money.But imagine, instead, that Jack and Jill both care only about fairness and that the fairest outcome is equality.Then Jack would offer Jill half the money; and Jill wouldn't accept otherwise.

But the younger generation--those aged 18-24--think highly of kindness rules. They choose kindness by 10% over honesty as the most important quality to teach kids. The question of whether kindness is learned or taught--or somewhere in between --causes different opinions. According to the study, Americans have different opinions on whether kindness in something one is born with or needs to be learned and _ over time. Slightly more than half(52%) of the participants believe that all of us are born with the ability to show kindness, while 48% believe kindness must be developed. Parenthood  makes a difference to your thoughts on the causes of kindness. Those without kids(56%) are more likely to think that people are born to be kind, while 50% of the participants with kids think kindness is developed. Also, 51% of dads and 54% of men with no kids believe kindness is something time is born with. Slightly more than half of the moms say kindness must be learned, while 48% believe it is what one is born with. What is the test mainly about?", "subject": ""}

Amphibians, animals such as frogs that can live both on land and in water, have long been known to be capable of breathing through their skin. In fact, the first known lungless frog that breathes only through its skin was discovered recently in the rivers of Borneo. Now the same oxygen sensors found in frog skins and in the lungs of mammals   have unexpectedly been discovered in the skin of mice. \"No one had ever looked,\" explained Randall Johnson, a biologist researcher. Mice and frogs are quite distant relatives, so the fact they have these molecules   in common in their skin suggests they might well be found in the skin of other mammals, such as humans. \"We have no reason to think that they are not in the skin of people too,\" Johnson said. These molecules not only detect oxygen, but help increase levels of vital red blood cells, which carry oxygen around the body. Normal mice breathing in air that is 10 percent oxygen--a dangerously low level similar to conditions at the top of Mount Everest, and about half that of air at sea level. However, mice that had the oxygen sensor HIF-1a genetically removed from their skin failed to produce this hormone   even after hours of such low oxygen. These findings, if they hold true in humans, suggest one could raise the level of oxygen circulating inside the body. This could help treat lung diseases and disorders such as anemia   without injecting drugs, which make up a multibillion-dollar market, Johnson said. Athletes also often try to get more oxygen delivered to their muscles in order to improve their performance. They often do this by training at high altitudes or in low-oxygen tents. The new study suggests they might want to expose their skin as well as breathing in low-oxygen air to improve their performance. \"It's hard to say what exactly might be done, however--there's a lot we don't know yet,\" Johnson explained.

Philip Davis,an English professor who has worked on the study with the university,will  tell a conference  this  week:\"Serious  literature  acts  like  a rocketbooster   to the brain.\" \"The research shows the power of classical literature to shift mental pathways,to create new thoughts,shapes and connections in the young and the old alike.\" What might be the author's purpose in writing the text?", "subject": ""}

Only after a week's leave---- during which he read novels, listened to music and walked with his wife on a beach---- was Rudenstine able to return to work. In our modern life, we have lost the rhythm between action and rest.

The busier we are, the more important we seem to ourselves and, we imagine, to others. To be unavailable to our friends and family, and to be unable to find time to relax---- this has become the model of a successful life. Because we do not rest, we lose our way.

Construction of the Taj Mahal took around 20 years. The building, which was made from white marble from the quarries  of Rajasthan, appears pink in the morning, white in the day and golden in the moonlight. Akashi Kaikyo Bridge, Japan It took 10 years to construct the Akashi Kaikyo Bridge. It connects the city of Kobe, on Japan's mainland, with Iwaya on Awaji Island. Before it opened, the only way to get between the two cities was ferry. However, the waterway was prone to   severe storms and when two ferries capsized   in 1955, killing 168 people, public anger convinced   the government of the need for a bridge. It's the longest suspension   bridge in the world, with a length of 1,991 meters. Panama Canal, Panama More than 4.5 million cubic yards of concrete were used in the construction of this canal's locks and dams. The Panama Canal is a 77-kilometer (47-mile) long waterway that connects the Atlantic and Pacific Oceans. The earth and rubble excavated   to make way for it was enough to bury Manhattan to a depth of four meters. A series of locks allow ships to pass through the water; each of the moveable lock doors weighs 750 tons and each of the locks fills with 52 million gallons of water to accommodate the 15,000 ships that use the canal every year.

The other lesson is that rare risks do hide and can spring up with little or no warning, and few of us are prepared for those. Remember the East Coast earthquake last week?

Though most of us didn't lose power, we know that 7 million people did. Though most of us did not suffer property damage, we know that millions did. Most of us did not lose loved ones, but we know that at least 21 families did. We know hurricanes can be dangerous, even if for many of us this one wasn't. The other lesson is that rare risks do hide and can spring up with little or no warning, and few of us are prepared for those. Remember the East Coast earthquake last week?   It might have been annoying to wait in line for hours for those extra D batteries or food supplies, but it was careful to do so, and it's a good idea to keep them on hand. Just because a risk might not be staring us in the face or feel all that scary, it doesn't mean that it doesn't make sense to be ready. Just in case.

At first, young children may spend all of their allowance soon after they receive it. If they do this, they will learn the hard way that spending must be done within a budget. Parents are usually advised not to offer more money until the next allowance. The object is to show young people that a budget demands choices between spending and saving. Older children may be responsible enough to save money for larger costs, like clothing or electronics. Allowances give children a chance to experience the things they can do with money. They can share it in the form of gifts or giving to a good cause. They can spend it by buying things they want. Or they can save and maybe even invest   it. Saving helps children understand that costly goals require sacrifice: you have to cut costs and plan for the future. Requiring children to save part of their allowance can also open the door to future saving and investing. Many banks offer services to help children and teenagers learn about personal finance.

Parents are usually advised not to offer more money until the next allowance. The object is to show young people that a budget demands choices between spending and saving. Older children may be responsible enough to save money for larger costs, like clothing or electronics. Allowances give children a chance to experience the things they can do with money. They can share it in the form of gifts or giving to a good cause. They can spend it by buying things they want. Or they can save and maybe even invest   it. Saving helps children understand that costly goals require sacrifice: you have to cut costs and plan for the future.

Although my house was already full of cats and dogs, I still couldn't resist an occasional visit to the shelter. This time as I was walking down the row of pens full of barking dogs I noticed a small boy looking into one of them.  He had a malnourished  looking body and a bony face with a big nose sticking out of the middle of it. He was looking at a small, golden dog. Its bony ribs were showing and its thin tail was folded between its legs. It wasn't begging for attention like the other puppies but was hiding in the corner instead. The boy looked up at me with sad eyes and asked what was wrong with it. \"It was probably abused and abandoned\", I said. \"That is why it is so scared.\" The boy immediately turned to an older lady and said, \"Grandma, I want this one.\" The old woman smiled and walked to the front desk to fill out the adoption forms. I followed and asked about the boy. I found out that he'd had a rough start in life too. She had just gotten custody  of him after the state had taken him from his parents. She had hoped getting a dog would make it easier on him. I looked back at him, holding his scared puppy, and said a prayer for them both. It was yesterday. I was driving down the road enjoying a gloriously sunny, spring day. Then in a green front yard I saw the boy. His teenage body was tall and strong. His nose no longer seemed big but fit well into his smiling face. He was throwing a ball to a healthy, happy dog with shining golden hair.

That might be a bit hot for humans, but it was just right for the giant dinosaurs that wandered about the earth during the Mesozoic   era. A new study found that planteating dinosaurs may have contributed to the warming of the earthby releasing significant amounts of methane  . The study, published in science journal Current Biology, focused on sauropods, longnecked herbivores   that munched   on the top of trees. They  were the largest of the dinosaurs; food broke down in their  stomachs for long periods of time.  The researchers estimate that a sauropoda released 2,675 liters of methane per  day--adding up to a large amount of the greenhouse gas  being pumped from dinosaur's gut into the atmosphere. Plant eaters naturally release methane as part of their   digestive process. The larger the animal, the more methane  it produces. Methane, a greenhouse gas, traps heat and remains in the atmosphere for approximately 915 years,  which warms the atmosphere. Today,  some  animals,  such  as  cattle,  goats  and  sheep, produce large amounts of methane as a byproduct  to their food digestion. Methane is also released from human--influenced sources such as landfill, agricultural activities, coal mining and other industrial practices--which all contribute to today's climate change, according to the  Environmental Protection Agency. The researchers estimate that earth's sauropods would  have produced about 520 million tons of methane per  year--similar to the total amount of methane produced today by natural and manmade sources.  However, the researchers warn that their numbers are estimates based on  multiple assumptions about the digestive systems and populations of dinosaurs. The author of the study David Wilkinson says the  emission of methane from dinosaurs would have been just  one of the causes of warm climate during the Mesozoic era.

Before 1950, most people lived in towns or cities and either walked to work or took public transportation. Only very wealthy people had automobiles. Farmers lived in rural areas or isolated villages and came into town only when they needed things they couldn't produce themselves.

Now ambitious workers could live in the suburbs, the areas just outside cities, which started to grow rapidly.

Only in recent years have people come to mourn the old way of life as they have developed insight into the problems. Now people realize that urban sprawl has come with serious environmental problems. The negative aspects of sprawl include air and water pollution, loss of agricultural land, traffic jams, and the death of businesses in the old town centers.

His social worker assured me that he would be a good, reliable busboy. But I had never had a mentally handicapped employee. He was short, a little fat, with the smooth facial features and thick-togued speech of Down's Syndrome . I thought most of my customers would be uncomfortable around Stevie, so I closely watched him for the first few weeks. I shouldn't have worried. After the first week, Stevie had my staff wrapped around his stubby little finger, and within a month my regular trucker customers had adopted him as their official truck stop mascot. After that, I really didn't care what the rest of the customers thought of him. He was like a 21-year-old in blue jeans and Nikes, eager to laugh and eager to please, but fierce in his attention to his duties. Every salt and pepper shaker was exactly in its place, not a bread crumb or coffee spill was visible when Stevie got done with the table. Our only problem was persuading him to wait to clean a table until after the customers were finished. Over time, we learned that he lived with his mother, a widow who was disabled. Money was tight, and _ . That's why the restaurant was a gloomy place that morning last August, the first morning in three years that Stevie missed work. He was at the Mayo Clinic in Rochester getting a heart surgery. His social worker said that people with Downs Syndrome often had heart problems at an early age and there was a good chance he would come through the surgery in good shape and be back at work in a few months. A ripple of excitement ran through the staff later that morning when word came that he was out of surgery, in recovery, and doing fine. Frannie, my head waitress, did a little dance when she heard the good news. Belle Ringer, one of our regular trucker customers, stared at her and asked, \"Okay, Frannie, what was that all about?\" \"We just got word that Stevie is out of surgery and going to be okay.\" \"I was wondering where he was. I had a new joke to tell him. What was the surgery about?\" Frannie quickly told Belle Ringer and the other two drivers sitting at his booth about Stevie's surgery, then sighed: \"Yeah, I'm glad he is going to be OK,\" she said. \"But I don't know how he and his Mom are going to handle all the bills. From what I hear, they're barely getting by as it is.\" Belle Ringer nodded thoughtfully, and Frannie hurried off to wait on the rest of her tables. After the morning rush, Frannie walked into my office. She had a couple of paper napkins in her hand. \"What's up?\" I asked. \"I cleared off that table where Belle Ringer and his friends were sitting after they left, and I found this. This was folded and tucked under a coffee cup.\" She handed the napkin to me, and three $20 bills fell onto my desk when I opened it. On the outside, in big, bold letters, was printed \"Something For Stevie\". That was three months ago. Today is New Year's day , the first day Stevie is supposed to be back to work. His placement worker said he had been counting the days until the doctor said he could work, I arranged to have his mother bring him to work, met them in the parking lot and invited them both to celebrate his day back. I took him and his mother by their arms. \"To celebrate you coming back, breakfast for you and your mother is on me.\" I led them toward a large corner booth. I could feel and hear truck customers and the rest of the staff following behind as we marched through the dining room. We stopped in front of the big table. Its surface was covered with coffee cups and dinner plates, all sitting slightly on dozens of folded paper napkins. \"First thing you have to do, Stevie, is clean up this mess,\" I said. Stevie looked at me, and then pulled out one of the napkins. It had \"Something for Stevie\" printed on the outside. As he picked it up, two $10 bills fell onto the table. Stevie stared at the money, then at all the napkins peeking from beneath the tableware, each with his name printed on it. I turned to his mother. \"There's more than $10,000 in cash and checks on that table, all from truckers and trucking companies that heard about your problems. Happy Thanksgiving!\" While everybody else was busy shaking hands and hugging each other, Stevie, with a big, big smile on his face, was busy clearing all the cups and dishes from the table.

He was at the Mayo Clinic in Rochester getting a heart surgery.

A ripple of excitement ran through the staff later that morning when word came that he was out of surgery, in recovery, and doing fine. Frannie, my head waitress, did a little dance when she heard the good news. Belle Ringer, one of our regular trucker customers, stared at her and asked, \"Okay, Frannie, what was that all about?\" \"We just got word that Stevie is out of surgery and going to be okay.\" \"I was wondering where he was. I had a new joke to tell him. What was the surgery about?\" Frannie quickly told Belle Ringer and the other two drivers sitting at his booth about Stevie's surgery, then sighed: \"Yeah, I'm glad he is going to be OK,\" she said. \"But I don't know how he and his Mom are going to handle all the bills. From what I hear, they're barely getting by as it is.\" Belle Ringer nodded thoughtfully, and Frannie hurried off to wait on the rest of her tables. After the morning rush, Frannie walked into my office. She had a couple of paper napkins in her hand. \"What's up?\" I asked. \"I cleared off that table where Belle Ringer and his friends were sitting after they left, and I found this.

His placement worker said he had been counting the days until the doctor said he could work, I arranged to have his mother bring him to work, met them in the parking lot and invited them both to celebrate his day back. I took him and his mother by their arms. \"To celebrate you coming back, breakfast for you and your mother is on me.\" I led them toward a large corner booth. I could feel and hear truck customers and the rest of the staff following behind as we marched through the dining room. We stopped in front of the big table. Its surface was covered with coffee cups and dinner plates, all sitting slightly on dozens of folded paper napkins. \"First thing you have to do, Stevie, is clean up this mess,\" I said. Stevie looked at me, and then pulled out one of the napkins. It had \"Something for Stevie\" printed on the outside. As he picked it up, two $10 bills fell onto the table.

{"answer": 3, "choices": ["2", "3", "4", "5"], "question": "For many students in the UK today, deciding whether or not to go to university can be as much about affordability as it is about ambition and aspiration. In the past, students in the UK could apply to a university or college. They were sure that even if they came from a low income family, their tuition fees and some of their living (or maintenance) costs would be covered by a local authority grant . A university education was, in a financial sense, open to all and the number of students attending university grew yearly. Sadly, it seems, those days are long gone. The turning point came in 1998, when the Labour Government introduced tuition fees of PS1,000 a year and, instead of giving students a maintenance grant, asked them to cover their own living expenses with a repayable student loan. Only students on the lowest incomes were entitled to a grant. The flood gates had been opened. As time passed, the ceiling on tuition fees rose, and although applicants from Scotland, Northern Ireland and Wales still qualified for varying levels of subsidy , by 2009/10 students in England often found themselves facing tuition fees overPS3,000 a year. In 2011 the Government announced that, from 2012, universities could charge fees of up to PS9,000 a year. Although the Government by stating that postgraduates did not have to begin repaying their student loans until they were earning more than PS21,000 a year, the news created over-dissatisfaction. Many students argued that it was unfair that students should have to begin their work life loaded with huge debt, while others complained that the changes would bring back a class divide to university education. These views were reflected in the number of students applying for a university place, which by January 2012 fell by more than 22,000. The Universities Minister, David Willetts, stood by the decision to increase tuition fees, saying that they would not \"put universities' finance on a bearable footing\" and that they would accelerate \"a stronger focus on high quality teaching.\" We can put the sentence \"But the biggest change was still to come\" at the beginning of Paragraph    _   .", "subject": ""}

The researchers at Kanazawa Medical University, Japan and American company Johnson conducted the study together. They looked at the effects of light reflection on newly fallen snow on a ski trail (a rough path) in Ishikawa District, northern Japan. They compared the results with the levels of UV rays on a sand beach in southern Japan's Okinawa District. They found that on the beach, eyes are exposed to a daily 260 kilojoules   of UV a square meter compared to 658 kilojoules in snow-covered areas. The findings are supported by the Japan Meteorological Agency. According to the agency, the reflection rate of UV light on beaches is often between 10 and 25 percent, compared to 80 percent in the new snow areas. The amount of light increased 4 percent with a 300-meter rise in height. Most of us know that UV rays can harm the skin. That's why we wear sunscreen on our skin before we get out in the sun. But many of us may not realize that UV rays are also harmful to the eyes. If your eyes are exposed to large amounts of UV radiation over a short period of time, you may experience a kind of sunburn of the eye, which is harmful. Your eyes will become red and feel a strange feeling. They may be sensitive to light. Fortunately, this is usually temporary and seldom causes permanent damage to the eyes.

Besides the names and numbers that you've programmed into it, traces of your DNA remain on it, according to a new study. DNA is genetic material that appears in every cell. Like your fingerprint, your DNA is unique to you --- unless you have an identical twin. Scientists today usually analyze DNA in blood,saliva , or hair left behind at the scene of a crime. The results often help detectives identify criminals and their victims. Meghan J. McFadden, a biologist at McMaster University in Hamilton, Ontario, heard about a crime in which the suspect bled onto a cell phone and later dropped the device. This made her wonder whether traces of DNA remained on cell phones --- even when no blood was involved. To find out, she and a colleague collectedflip-style  phones from 10 volunteers. They collected invisible traces of the users from two parts of the phone: the outside, where the user holds it, and the speaker, which is placed at the user's ear.

When he was 14,Austin and a friend began uploading pop songs to musical websites.\"I was just doing it because we had nothing to do, living in a small town.\" \"I'd check different websites for the hottest songs, and I'd record my own videos,\" he explains. \"That's how people began to find me online.\"His videos got millions of hits and he signed with a record company. The result was the release of Austin's first album,Junior Year. While it seems like a sudden rise for the teenager, Austin admits the early days were not always fun. He says a lot of people thought badly of him for posting his videos online. Yet _ didn't put him off.\"I kept working hard. \"And the hits on his videos kept coming. Austin's achievement and spirit make him a perfect fit for the message of We Day. After all, Free the Children, the creator of the event, was founded to \"enable youth to make changes.\" Even Austin's unusual rise by way of the Internet fits with the way Free The children works and raises money. Because of Austin, his four million followers will learn about Free the Children. While Austin's presence certainly helps We Day, it's good for him, too.

There are three stages of culture shock, say the experts. In the first stage, the newcomers like their new environment. Then, when the fresh experience dies, they begin to hate the city, the country, the people and everything else. In the last stage, the newcomers begin to adjust to their surroundings and, as a result, enjoy their life more. There are some obvious factors in culture shock. The weather may be unpleasant. The customs may be different. The public service systems---the telephone, post office ,or transportation --may be difficult to work out. The simplest things seem to be big problems. The language may be difficult. Who feels culture shock? Everyone does in this way or that. But culture shock surprises most people. Very often the people having the worst culture shock are those who never had any difficulties in their home countries and were successful in their community. Coming to a new country, these people find they do not have the same established positions. They find themselves without a role, almost without an identity. They have to build a new self-image. Culture shock causes a feeling of disorientation  . This feeling may be homesickness. When homesick, people feel like staying inside all the time. They want to protect themselves from the strange environment, and create an escape inside their room for a sense of security.

If I had wanted to, I could have bought my book through dozens of e-book apps   in the Apple App Store. Most are free and offer access to thousands of free e-books or paid versions. But the big downside for many is that you can read them only on Apple devices. Both iPads 1&2 offer an immersive reading experience. I found myself jumping back and forth between my book and the Web, looking up old facts and pictures of New York City. I also found myself being sucked into the wormhole of the Internet and a few games of Angry Birds rather than reading my book. For the last chapters of the book, I read the paperback, which is still my favourite choice. Since we are comparing devices so I guess I need to choose one. In the end it might come down to Kindle. But if money is tight, go for print. My used paperback cost only$4 from Amazon. A possible customer would not buy iPads 1 & 2 for reading because   _  .", "subject": ""}

For example, riding a bike, running or just walking, etc. We simply have to change our way of thinking if we want to change the world. So comes the idea of solar roadways. Are they the road of future? Why use roads just for driving and collecting tolls  ? Why don't we use them for collecting energy?

The Solar Road Panels will contain embedded   LEDs which \"paint\" the road lines from beneath to provide safer nighttime driving as well as to give drivers instant instructions such as detour   ahead. The road will be able to sense wildlife on the road and can warn drivers to \"slow down\". There will also be embedded heating elements in the surface to prevent snow and ice buildup, providing safer winter driving. Replacing asphalt   roads and parking lots with Solar Roadway Panels will be a major step toward stopping climate change.

She lived a simple life. She seldom travelled. She never married and she died from illness when she was only 41. However, people all over the world remember her. Why? It is because Jane Austen is the author of some of the best-loved novels in the English language. These novels include Emma, Pride and Prejudice, Sense and Sensibility and Persuasion. Jane completed her last novel Persuasion in 1816, but it was not published until after her death. Persuasion is partly based on Jane's naval brother. Anne, the daughter of Sir Walter Elliot, falls in love with Captain Wentworth, a person of a lower social position. But she breaks off the engagement when persuaded by her friend Lady Russell that such a match is unworthy. The breakup produces in Anne a deep and long-lasting regret. Eight years later, Wentworth returns from sea a rich and successful captain. He finds Anne's family on the edge of financial ruin. Anne and the captain rediscover their love and get married. Jane Austen once compared her writing to painting on a little bit of ivory , two inches square. Readers of Persuasion will see that neither her skill of delicate, ironic  observations on social custom, love, and marriage nor her ability to apply a sharp focus to English manners and morals has abandoned her in her final finished work. Persuasion has produced three film adaptations: a 1995 version starring Amanda Root and Ciaran Hinds, a 2007 TV miniseries with Sally Hawkins and Rupert Penry-Jones, and a 1971 miniseries with Ann Firbank and Bryan Marshall. People who are interested in Jane Austen can still visit many of the places she visited and lived. These places include the village of Steventon, although her family house is now gone.

But it's hardly possible to completely stay out of it  scientists are now 95 percent sure that humans have been the \" cause\" of global warming trends since the 1950s. One of the conclusions of a report released on Sept 27 by the United Nations says that human activities have caused global temperatures to rise by 0.89 0C between 1901 and 2012. That might not seem like a lot, but the truth is that a major part of that heat has been absorbed into the oceans, which is not surprising given that they cover two thirds of Earth's surface. Also, water has a much greater capacity   to absorb heat than the air does, according to The Economist. While many greenhouse gases occur naturally and are needed to keep the Earth warm enough to support life, humans' use of fossil fuels is the main source of excess   greenhouse gases. According to CNN, by driving cars, using electricity produced by burning coal and oil or heating our homes with coal or natural gas, we release a large amount of greenhouse gases into the atmosphere. Your body can barely feel a difference of 0.89 0C, but the Earth's ecosystems are so sensitive that even small changes can disturb them. It often starts with the smallest creatures at the bottom of the food chain, eventually affecting bigger animals, many of which could end up becoming extinct. Global warming is also linked to an increase in extreme weather. A larger amount of carbon dioxide traps more energy inside the atmosphere. This changes the patterns of storms and rainfall in many regions and can lead to droughts and floods. Worse still, melting sea ice in warmer oceans is causing sea levels to rise at a speed of more than three millimeters per year, according to The Guardian, which also increases the risk of flooding. \"The report should serve as another wakeup call that our activities today have a profound impact on society, not only for us, but for many generations to come,\" French Michel Jarraud, secretarygeneral of the World Meteorological Organization, said at a news conference.

It often starts with the smallest creatures at the bottom of the food chain, eventually affecting bigger animals, many of which could end up becoming extinct. Global warming is also linked to an increase in extreme weather. A larger amount of carbon dioxide traps more energy inside the atmosphere. This changes the patterns of storms and rainfall in many regions and can lead to droughts and floods. Worse still, melting sea ice in warmer oceans is causing sea levels to rise at a speed of more than three millimeters per year, according to The Guardian, which also increases the risk of flooding. \"The report should serve as another wakeup call that our activities today have a profound impact on society, not only for us, but for many generations to come,\" French Michel Jarraud, secretarygeneral of the World Meteorological Organization, said at a news conference.

But it's hardly possible to completely stay out of it  scientists are now 95 percent sure that humans have been the \" cause\" of global warming trends since the 1950s. One of the conclusions of a report released on Sept 27 by the United Nations says that human activities have caused global temperatures to rise by 0.89 0C between 1901 and 2012. That might not seem like a lot, but the truth is that a major part of that heat has been absorbed into the oceans, which is not surprising given that they cover two thirds of Earth's surface. Also, water has a much greater capacity   to absorb heat than the air does, according to The Economist. While many greenhouse gases occur naturally and are needed to keep the Earth warm enough to support life, humans' use of fossil fuels is the main source of excess   greenhouse gases.

Scientists at the Medical Research Council found that elderly people who could still give a firm handshake and walk at a quick pace were likely to outlive their slower peers. They found simple measures of physical capability like shaking hands, walking, getting up from a chair and balancing on one leg were related to the life expectancy, even after accounting for age, sex and body size. The study is the first to provide a comprehensive   view of the existing data from 33 studies. \"These measures have been used in population-based research for quite a long time,\" said Rachel Cooper of the Medical Research Council's Unit for Lifelong Health and Aging. \"They may be useful indicators for subsequent health.\" Cooper, whose study appears in the British Medical Journal, said more studies are needed to clarify whether the measures would be helpful to doctors as a screening tool. \"I wouldn't suggest that we roll them out into clinical practice tomorrow, but it is possible that they could be used in the future,\" she told the media. The researchers examined 33 studies involving tens of thousands of people, most of whom were aged over 60 but living in the community rather than in hospital or care homes. The researchers found that those with the strongest hand grasps tended to live longer than those with weak grips. The death rate over the period of the studies for people with weak handshakes was 67 percent higher than for people with a firm grip. The slowest walkers were nearly three times more likely to die during the study period than swifter walkers.

In it the majority of students will have conformed to   the standard model of the time: male, middle class and Western. Walk into a class today, however, and you'll get a completely different impression. For a start, you will now see plenty more women--the University of Pennsylvania's Wharton School, for example, boasts that 40% of its new enrolment is female. You will also see a wide range of ethnic groups and nationals of practically every country. It might be tempting, therefore, to think that the old barriers have been broken down and equal opportunity achieved. But, increasingly, this apparent diversity   is becoming a mask for a new type of conformity. Behind the differences in sex, skin tones and mother tongues, there are common attitudes, expectations and ambitions which risk creating a set of clones among the business leaders of the future. Diversity, it seems, has not helped to address fundamental weaknesses in business leadership. So what can be done to create more effective managers of the commercial world? According to Valerie Gauthier, associate dean at HEC Paris, the key lies in the process by which MBA programmes recruit   their students. At the moment candidates are selected on a fairly narrow set of criteria such as prior   academic and career performance, and analytical and problem solving abilities. This is then coupled to a school's picture of what a diverse class should look like, with the result that passport, ethnic origin and sex can all become influencing factors. But schools rarely dig down to find out what really makes an applicant succeed, to create a class which also contains diversity of attitude and approach--arguably the only diversity that, in a business context, really matters. Professor Gauthier believes schools should not just be selecting candidates from traditional sectors such as banking, consultancy and industry. They should also be seeking individuals who have backgrounds in areas such as political science, the creative arts, history or philosophy, which will allow them to put business decisions into a wider context. Indeed, there does seem to be a demand for the more rounded leaders such diversity might create. A study by Mannaz, a leadership development company, suggests that, while the bully-boy chief executive of old may not have been eradicated   completely, there is a definite shift in emphasis towards less tough styles of management--at least in America and Europe.

Suppose the pitch is a ball. \"Nothing happened,\" you say. The skeptic and the innocent must play the game. And this involvement in the stands is no more intellectual than listening to music is. Watch the third baseman. Smooth the dirt in front of you with one foot; smooth the pocket in your glove; watch the eyes of the batter, the speed of the bat, the sound of ball on wood. If football is a symphony of movement and theatre, baseball is chamber music, a spacious interlocking  of notes, chorus and responses. The author admits that    _    .", "subject": ""}
{"answer": 0, "choices": ["Privacy", "Income", "Age", "Marriage"], "question": "Living in a culture that is different from your own can be both an exciting and challenging experience. The following are six cultural differences between China and the US to help promote mutual understanding.                Chinese people do not have the same concept of privacy as Americans do. They talk about topics such as ages, income or marital status, which Americans think is annoying and disturbing. Family  In China, elders are traditionally treated with great respect while the young are cared for. In America, the goal of the family is to encourage independence, particularly that of the children. Unlike the Chinese, older Americans seldom live with their children. Friends Chinese people have different meanings to define friends. Just hanging out together time to time is not friendship. Friendship means lifelong friends who feel it deeply necessary to give each other whatever help might seem required. Americans always call people they meet friends, so the definition of friends is general and different. There are work friends, playing friends, school friends and drinking friends. Money As is well known,the Chinese like to save. They are always conservative when they are planning to spend money. It is different in the US, where far fewer families are saving money for emergencies and education than their Chinese counterparts  Education Chinese people value education and career more than Americans, who in turn put more emphasis on good character and faith. Team VS Individual Basically China values the community and the US values the individual. If you achieve something in the US, it's because you are great. While in China, if you achieve something it's because the team, or family, or company is great. Everything you do gets attributed to the greater whole, while in America individual merits  are celebrated. Which is the most appropriate word to show the first cultural difference ?", "subject": ""}

When I'm writing a book, I always try to create something strange or puzzling in each picture. By using artistic strategies, I can give the drawing a kind of mysterious quality. All of my books are picture books, so they are generally thought of as books for children. But when I make them, I think of the books as being for everybody -- for people of all ages.

But my interest in drawing wasn't encouraged very much. Growing up in the 1950s, in Grand Rapids, Michigan, boys were supposed to be athletic. Certain peer pressures encouraged little fingers to learn how to hold footballs rather than crayons. My early love for drawing developed into a love for telling stories through pictures. Stories began as fragments   of pictures in my mind. I created a story by posing questions to myself. I called it the \"what if\" and \"what then\" approach.

This means that the plant has changed something in its \"body\" or \"habits\" to make it easier to survive in difficult conditions. There are several conditions they have had to adapted to. First, the soil of the forest floor is shallow. Also, the soil of the rainforest is not very rich, or easy to grow in. Next is the problem of very heavy rain which continues over a large part of the year. Finally, many plants of the rainforest are food for animals that live there. The biggest problem that rainforest plants have to adapt to is the lack of sunlight in the rainforest's lower levels. Plants have adapted to this problem in several ways. Many plants have very large leaves. The large leaf is helpful because it has a bigger surface area. The bigger surface area a leaf has, the more sunlight it can absorb. The canopy trees  adapt by growing to be 100 feet tall so that their leaves can grab all available sunlight. Other plants called lianas   have adapted by rooting themselves in the soil of the forest floor and growing up the trees until they reach the canopy layer. Still other plants, such as epiphytes, have adapted by growing directly on the trees' trunks and branches in the canopy and understory layers of the rainforest. An adaptation to the large amounts of rainfall that many rainforest plants have is called \"drip tips\". Their leaves are tapered  to a sharp point at the end.

When they opened the door, the Greens saw a dirty, tired dog with very hurting feet. The animal looked a little bit like Sam, but no one could believe that Sam could have walked 840 miles on his own. The tired dog spent the night under the family car. The next day, when he was more rested, he performed some of his old tricks. The Greens knew they had their own dog back.

She picks it up, unfolds it and finds a child's sketch   of a tear-stained face with a speech bubble saying: \"I'm sorry I was naughty--I'm a bad person.\" Sally, 42, draws a big smiley face on the back of the paper with \"I love you, Rose, and we're always going to look after you.\" Then she folds it up and launches the plane back into the living room where her nine-year-old daughter is watching TV with brother Jamie, 13 and dad Rod, 40. Jamie often makes pictures for his parents too--like the one showing a swift river with them on one side and him trapped on the other side. It's one of the many unusual ways that Sally and Rob have learned to communicate emotionally with their abused children in an astonishing eight-year journey of hope, healing and love. Jamie was just four and half--sister Rose one when they were adopted by the Donovans in 2005. The youngsters had been taken from their natural mother and placed in foster care after a series of cruelty and neglect. They were left alone, hungry, and witnessed home violence on a regular basis. Sally and Rob spent three years trying for a baby before deciding to adopt, and were well aware of the youngsters' poor background. But they were still unprepared for raising a child permanently scared by abuse or the lack of support on offer. But now Sally has written a brilliant and heart-touching account of their family struggle in a book called \"No Matter What\".  Sally said: \"These kids come to you with a story that what happened to them was their fault--because they are bad and unlovable. To show them they are loveable and none of it was their fault takes a lot of time. They both still say \"I'm bad\".

But it wasn't an ordinary bike. As he pedaled, the President stayed in place, while the energy from his pedaling powered a water filtration   system. He was testing an invention created by a team of 14 students from Northeast High School, in Oakland Park, Florida. Payton Karr, 16, and Kiona Elliot, 18, attended the fair as representatives of the project.\"We were hoping President Obama would ride the bike, but we didn't actually expect him to,\" Payton told TFK. \" It really meant a lot.\" Kiona agreed. \"It was pretty awesome to see the invention, which was invented by a group of 14 high school students and one teacher, along with the help of community members, got the interest of the leader of our nation,\" she said. The project was an idea that came about after one of the Northeast students, Kalie Hoke, visited Haiti after the terrible 2010 earthquake and saw how difficult it was to find clean water. The students invented a portable , bicycle-powered emergency water filtration system, which can provide 20-30 people with drinking water in a 15-hour period.

The way not to fall asleep at work is to take naps when you need them. \"We have to totally change our attitude toward napping,\" says Dr. William Dement of Stanford University, the godfather of sleep research. Last year a national commission led by Dement identified an \" _ \" which one member said was as important as the national debt. The commission was concerned about the dangers of sleepiness: people causing industrial accidents or falling asleep while driving. This may be why we have a new sleep policy in the White House. According to recent reports, President Clinton is trying to take a ha1f-hour snooze   every afternoon. About 60 percent of American adults nap when given the opportunity.

People and animals have been doing what they always do to prepare for the colder months. Squirrels  , for example, have been busy gathering nuts from trees. Well, scientists have been busy gathering information about what the squirrels do with the food they collect. They examined differences between red squirrels and gray squirrels in the American state of Indiana. The scientists wanted to know how these differences could affect the growth of black walnut   trees. The black walnut is the nut of choice for both kinds of squirrels. The black walnut tree is also a central part of some hardwood forests. Rob Swihart of Purdue University did the study with Jake Goheen, a former Purdue student now at the University of New Mexico. The two researchers estimate that several times as many walnuts grow when gathered by gray squirrels as compared to red squirrels. Gray squirrels and red squirrels do not store nuts and seeds in the same way. Gray squirrels bury nuts one at a time in a number of places. But they seldom remember where they buried every nut. So some nuts remain in the ground. Conditions are right for them to develop and grow the following spring. Red squirrels, however, store large groups of nuts above ground.

Visiting language exchange cafes - where international and German students meet to improve their European language - was a great way to practice in a relaxed space and meet a wide range of people. Not being afraid to make mistakes is important to learn a language.

By studying for a double major, although you will be studying for only one degree, you will be focusing on two related and integrated subjects that complement   each other.

Believe it or not, a touch of nervousness can sharpen your mind, allowing you to perform more quickly. This is because under stress, the body releases   the hormone adrenaline  , which prepares it for something important that will happen. However, too much anxiety can result in sleeplessness, loss of appetite before tests, and poor performance. Some people might feel hot and tired. With great anger they often shout or complain for no reason. If you worry a lot or are a perfectionist, you are more likely to have trouble with test anxiety. Those who have prepared poorly for a test or have had negative experiences taking tests may also experience test anxiety. When you feel a storm of anxiety coming on, stop what you're doing and make your mind a blank. If possible, actually tell yourself to 'STOP!' This will get your mind off the stress. Then think of being at a place of comfort and let your body relax. As you continue the test, find questions you know the answers to and answer them first. This will help restore your confidence.

{"answer": 1, "choices": ["Parents.", "Children.", "Teachers.", "Critics."], "question": "Winnie-the-Pooh By A. A. Milne Winnie-the-Pooh has been introduced and reintroduced to generation after generation as a model of a child's best friend. However, not everyone has found Pooh is lovely. This classic has been banned in a variety of countries at one point. So why would anyone ever want to keep children from the joy of Milne's classic? In the case of Russia, Winnie-the-Pooh was banned in 2009 because of alleged Nazi   ties. The Wonderful Wizard of Oz By Frank Baum Originally published in the year 1900, The Wonderful Wizard of Oz is one of the foundations of the fairytale genre. Who, then, would seek to ban a book that has become so important to the American experience? America is that who. The Detroit Library banned The Wonderful Wizard of Oz in 1957 for having no value for children. Charlotte's Web By E. B. White White's tale of the relationship between two unexpected creatures, a spider and a pig, has been drawing children in for over half a century. Published in 1952, this classic has been readily available on most library shelves for children to read. However, some people would like to make this book never see the light of day. In one extreme case, a school in England banned Charlotte's Web for fear that the pig Wilbur might be offensive   to Muslim students. Fortunately, the Muslim Council of Britain saw the foolishness of this ban, so the book was quickly restored to its right place on the shelves.

If you plan to visit the Shanghai Expo this summer, China Pavilion is a must-see area for you. China Pavilion, which is called Oriental Crown , is located at the center of the Expo site. Standing 63 meters tall, the China Pavilion takes the shape of an emperor's crown, with the upper layers larger than the lower ones. Covering 160,000 square meters in floor space, the pavilion consists of a national hall and a regional hall. Construction on the China Pavilion began on December 18, 2007. The design of the China Pavilion was picked from a total of 344 designs put forward by Chinese from around the world. The pavilion possesses both traditional and modern features, which helps develop the theme of the 2010 Expo: \" Better City, Better Life\". For example, it is red in appearance, which contains the elements of traditional Chinese culture, and it is green indoors, with the use of energy-saving techniques.

How to accommodate so many people in the pavilion remains a tough task. Luckily, the China Pavilion is built as a permanent landmark. During the Expo, the main structure will be used for an exhibition based on the theme of \" Chinese wisdom in urban development\" by explaining the values of harmony, nature and spirit. The three-story pavilion has three sections. The top floor's \"Footprint of the East\" will show some of the changes in Chinese cities. There, you can see a film which shows how Chinese cities have changed, especially in the past 30 years.

{"answer": 1, "choices": ["A journalist.", "A story-writer.", "An interviewer.", "An interviewee."], "question": "*Ms Tan, you've referred to your new novel as your eighth book. That's because it took me six or seven attempts at a second novel before I started and completed this one. *Why do you think you had so many false starts? I would say that my reasons were wrong. I was trying to prove that I wasn't just a mother-daughter storyteller, or I was trying to prove that I didn't just have to write about things that were strictly Chinese or Chinese-American. Those were never the right reasons for writing those early stories. And I could never come up with other better reasons for continuing them. *What kept you going on this book? This book was different because it was based on my mother's real life. The reason for writing it became more personal and emotional. AfterThe Joy Luck Clubcame out, my mother was always explaining to people that she wasn't any of the mothers in that book. And at one point she said to me, \"Next book tells my true story.\" And then she started telling me things I never knew before. She also told me many, many stories, because my mother doesn't generalize . The book really grew out of that. *Have you ever visited China? Yes. I've been there twice: about three years ago and then again last November, both times with my mother and my husband. *Was it difficult to understand the Chinese-American dialect  without sounding like a parody ? No, because it's the language I've heard all my life from my mother. She speaks English as it's direct translation from Chinese. But it's more than that. Her language also has more imagery than English. *Can you think of an example? Somebody might say to me, \"Don't work so hard. You'll kill yourself.\" My mother will say to me,\"Why do you press all your brains out on this page for someone else?\" So it's very vivid. That's the way she talks. *Have many readers told you that the Chinese mother in your book reminded them of the typical Jewish   mother? Many people have told me that. I think the mother-daughter relationship is very intense  in both cases. Culturally there is an acceptance that mothers have the power to tell their children, especially their daughters, how to conduct their lives --- not simply up until the time they are 18, but for the rest of their lives. However, when children grow up in a different culture from their parents',they tend to keep more secrets from their parents. The children think, \"They just wouldn't understand that I had to do this.\" And that can really create a gap, and it can grow as the number of secrets grows.

That's because it took me six or seven attempts at a second novel before I started and completed this one. *Why do you think you had so many false starts? I would say that my reasons were wrong. I was trying to prove that I wasn't just a mother-daughter storyteller, or I was trying to prove that I didn't just have to write about things that were strictly Chinese or Chinese-American. Those were never the right reasons for writing those early stories. And I could never come up with other better reasons for continuing them. *What kept you going on this book? This book was different because it was based on my mother's real life. The reason for writing it became more personal and emotional. AfterThe Joy Luck Clubcame out, my mother was always explaining to people that she wasn't any of the mothers in that book. And at one point she said to me, \"Next book tells my true story.\" And then she started telling me things I never knew before. She also told me many, many stories, because my mother doesn't generalize . The book really grew out of that. *Have you ever visited China? Yes. I've been there twice: about three years ago and then again last November, both times with my mother and my husband. *Was it difficult to understand the Chinese-American dialect  without sounding like a parody ? No, because it's the language I've heard all my life from my mother. She speaks English as it's direct translation from Chinese. But it's more than that. Her language also has more imagery than English. *Can you think of an example? Somebody might say to me, \"Don't work so hard. You'll kill yourself.\" My mother will say to me,\"Why do you press all your brains out on this page for someone else?\" So it's very vivid. That's the way she talks. *Have many readers told you that the Chinese mother in your book reminded them of the typical Jewish   mother? Many people have told me that. I think the mother-daughter relationship is very intense  in both cases. Culturally there is an acceptance that mothers have the power to tell their children, especially their daughters, how to conduct their lives --- not simply up until the time they are 18, but for the rest of their lives. However, when children grow up in a different culture from their parents',they tend to keep more secrets from their parents. The children think, \"They just wouldn't understand that I had to do this.\" And that can really create a gap, and it can grow as the number of secrets grows.

English people are always known to be well-mannered and cold, but we are not cold - we don't _ your situation. If we are heartbroken, we don't scream in your face with tears - we go home and cry on our own. It's completely to do with your comfort - we don't intrude on your space. That's very English.\" A BBC reader noted that the perceived coldness of British people is actually their way of dealing with hardship. Remembering the terrorist attacks in London on July 7, 2005, Stuart Colley, who lived in the capital at the time, said: \"It seemed to me that most people's response was a 'cruel' determination to carry on and not to 'fall' into an over-emotional outpouring of grief or anger - despite what many of us felt inside. Our stiff upper lip seems to be something that gives us strength as a society when we most need it.\" With the example of the terrorist attacks in London on July 7, 2005, the author intends to   _  .", "subject": ""}

I feel a lot of pressure to do well and I will certainly do my best.\" Zhu was elected to the post a month ago. She spent all her free time collecting requests and suggestions from fellow migrant workers. Zhu Xueqin said, \"We've held at least ten meetings to discuss the problems of restaurant staff and construction and factory workers.\" Since her election to be an NPC deputy, Zhu has received numerous requests from other migrant workers, who want her to help solve their problems. She is aiming for a paid holiday system so migrant workers can decide for themselves when they go back home to see their families. And she is also calling for maternity insurance for the migrants. China's workers from rural areas are estimated to a number around 200 million. And these migrants have become a main part of the country's work force. In March last year, the NPC annual session approved a draft resolution   on the elections. The draft stated that provinces and municipalities with a large population of rural migrant workers should have a quota for NPC deputies. Who or what does Zhu Xueqin represent?", "subject": ""}

Now a new University of Pennsylvania study shows that muttering can actually help people find lost objects--in other words, saying the name of an object helps you find it more quickly. Previous work has suggested that speaking aloud while performing step-by-step tasks, like tying shoelaces  ,can help kids guide their behavior and let them focus on the job in hand. However, scientists were not sure if speaking aloud when performing tasks could help adults in the same way, especially when looking for particular objects. Professor Gary Lupan and Daniel Swingley, writing for the Quarterly Journal of Experimental Psychology, carried out some experiments. They hoped to give the fact that next time you lose your keys, muttering \" keys,keys,keys\"can in fact help you find them. Inspired by viewing people muttering to themselves as they try to find things like peanut butter in a supermarket, the researchers conducted two experiments to see if this actually worked. In the first, participants were shown 20 pictures of various objects and were asked to find a certain one, with some seeing a text label  telling them what they were looking for. These participants were then asked to search for the object again while saying the word to themselves, with results showing that saying it aloud helped people find the object more quickly. The second experiment saw participants performing a shopping task, where they were shown photographs of items  commonly found on supermarket shelves.

{"answer": 3, "choices": ["The test was devised in the 1920's.", "7,752 identical and non-identical twins took part in it.", "The test was set to assess children's intelligence.", "The children took the test at four."], "question": "LONDON, Aug. 19 (Xinhua) -- A four-year-old child's ability to draw could be an indicator of intelligence at age 14, according to a study published on Tuesday in the British journal Psychological Science. The researchers from King's College London (KCL) studied 7,752 pairs of identical and non-identical twins, and found that the link between drawing and later intelligence was influenced by genes. At the age of 4, children were asked by their parents to complete a 'Draw-a-Child' test. Their drawings were rated from 0 to 12, based on the presence and correct number of body-parts, like arms, legs, head, eyes and nose. The children were also given verbal and non-verbal intelligence tests at ages 4 and 14. According to researchers, the test was devised in the 1920's to assess children's intelligence, so it's not surprising that the test correlated with intelligence at age 4.However, they found that higher scores on the test were also moderately associated with higher scores of intelligence at 14. The researchers also measured the heritability of figure drawing. Identical twins share all their genes, whereas non-identical twins only share about 50 percent. Overall, at age 4, drawings from identical twin pairs were more similar to one another than drawings from non-identical twin pairs. Therefore, the researchers concluded that differences in children's drawings have an important genetic link. They also found that drawing at age 4 and intelligence at age 14 had a strong genetic link. \"Drawing is an ancient behaviour, dating back beyond 15,000 years ago,\" Dr. Rosalind Arden, lead author of the paper from KCL, said that: \"This capacity to reproduce figures is a uniquely human ability and a sign of cognitive ability, in a similar way to writing, which transformed the human species' ability to store information, and build a civilisation.\" According to the passage, which of the following statement about 'Draw-a-Child' test is true?", "subject": ""}

{"answer": 2, "choices": ["dieting to lose weight", "releasing emotions", "getting enough sleep", "exercising the mind"], "question": "Let Children Roam  Free Everyone agrees that playing outside keeps children thinner. The loss of opportunities for outdoor play is one of the main causes of childhood obesity. What is more remarkable is the growing evidence that children's mental health and emotional well-being are enhanced by contact with the outdoors, and that the restorative  effect appears to be strongest in natural settings. Researchers are convinced of the depth of the connection between children's well-being and the environment, claiming that contact with nature may be as important to children as good nutrition and adequate sleep. But now children seem to get less touch with outdoor activities. The root causes of the dramatic loss of children's freedom lie in changes to the very fabric of their lives over the last 30 years or so. The growth in road traffic, alongside poor town planning and shifts in the make-up and daily rhythms of families and communities, have left children with fewer outdoor places to go. These changes coincided with the \"culture of fear\": a generalized anxiety about all imaginary kinds of threats, even though children are statistically safer from harm now than at any point in human history. These physical, economic and social changes and fears have been made use of by manufactures and advertisers, whose products and messages both reinforce the logic of keeping children virtual prisoners, and force us to compensate them in the only way our cash-rich, time-poor society seems to know: by spending money on them. Government must bear some of the blame for keeping children prisoners indoor, through their promotion of planning policies that favour cars over communities and profit over people. The real planning crimes lie in housing companies occupying attractive parks and green spaces, and in town plans that force families to depend largely on their cars. There is no doubt that traffic danger, unlike stranger danger, is a real threat to children and a constant worry for parents.  Around 100 child pedestrians  are killed every year, a figure that puts the UK near the bottom of Europe's child road safety league. It is no surprise that figures show a steady fall in children walking or cycling over the last twenty years, to the extent that while over 90% of children own a bicycle, just 2% cycle to school. Also, 30% of children aged eight to ten never play outside without an adult watching over them. In a single generation, the \"home habitat\" of a typical eight-year-old----the area in which children are able to travel on their own- has shrunk to one-ninth of its former size. Health experts have even created a new word, \"obesogenic\", to describe those aspects of our lives that make us fat, and top of the list is the design of streets, towns and cities.

The root causes of the dramatic loss of children's freedom lie in changes to the very fabric of their lives over the last 30 years or so. The growth in road traffic, alongside poor town planning and shifts in the make-up and daily rhythms of families and communities, have left children with fewer outdoor places to go. These changes coincided with the \"culture of fear\": a generalized anxiety about all imaginary kinds of threats, even though children are statistically safer from harm now than at any point in human history. These physical, economic and social changes and fears have been made use of by manufactures and advertisers, whose products and messages both reinforce the logic of keeping children virtual prisoners, and force us to compensate them in the only way our cash-rich, time-poor society seems to know: by spending money on them.

All parents want smart children. Avoiding spanking and correcting misbehavior in other ways can help that happen. A new research by Professor Murray Straus found that children in the United States who were spanked had lower IQs four years later than those who weren't spanked. Straus and Mallie Paschall, a senior research scientist, studied nationally examples of 806 children aged 2 to 4, and 704 aged 5 to 9. Both groups were retested four years later. The IQs of children IQs aged 2 to 4 who weren't spanked were 5 points higher four year later than the IQs of those who were spanked. The IQs of children aged 5 to 9 who weren't spanked were 2.8 points higher four years later than the IQs of children at the same age who were spanked. How often parents spanked made a difference. The more spanking, the slower the development of children's mental ability. But even small amounts of spanking made a difference. Straus also found a lower national average IQ in nations in which spanking was more popular. His analysis shows the strongest link between physical punishment and IQ is for those whose parents continue to use physical punishment even when they are teenagers. Straus also found a lower national average IQ in nations in which spanking was more popular. His analysis shows the strongest link between physical punishment and IQ is for those whose parents continue to use physical punishment even when they are teenagers. Straus and colleagues in 32 nations used data on physical punishment experienced by 17,404 university students when they were children. According to Straus, there're two explanations for the relation of physical punishment to lower IQ. First, physical punishment is extremely stressful and can become a long-lasting stressor for young children, who typically experience punishment three or more times a week. For many it continues for years. The stress of physical punishment often leads to being fearful that terrible things are about to happen and being easily shocked. They're associated with lower IQ. Second, a higher national level of economic development leads to both fewer parents using physical punishment and a higher national IQ. The good news is that the use of physical punishment has been decreasing worldwide, which may signal future gains in IQ across the globe. The United Nations has called on all member nations to forbid physical punishment by parents. Nevertheless, there's evidence that attitude favoring physical punishment and actual use of physical punishment have been declining even in nations which haven't forbidden physical punishment.

Recently more and more hospitals and clinics have been _ the power of music -not only to comfort patients, but to help cure them as well. Welcome to the world of music therapy . After each of the two world wars, musicians visited hospitals and played instruments for injured soldiers suffering from emotional and physical pain. Today's music therapists continue this practice, playing instruments such as guitars and harps to bring comfort to their audiences. Therapist Eric Mammen encourages his patients at a children's hospital to participate with him as he plays. During visits with 13-year-old cancer patient Lawrence Garcia, Mammen encourages Garcia to beat on electric drums while he plays the guitar. The therapy won't cure his cancer, but it does, according to Garcia's mom, take away much of the boy's depression . Music therapy can put patients in better moods and ease the symptoms of depression according to the American Music Therapy Association. Other benefits include relieving pain, calming tension, aiding sleep, reducing worry or fear, and easing muscle tension. Jose Haro personally experienced the benefits of music therapy when he was recovering from heart surgery. During his recovery, he played a piano whose keys lit up, indicating which keys to touch to play along with the background music. Soon he was playing tunes and noticing something strange. \"I was searching for my pain.\" He says of his experience, \"but it was gone.\" While Haro's experience provides an evidence of the power of music to relieve pain, scientific research has proven music also helps patients with Alzheimer's disease and arthritis. In addition, music therapy helps premature babies. Doctors are tapping into a powerful way to teach premature babies that haven't yet learned how to suck. Doctors use a device that comforts the babies by playing music when they suck on a pacifier . Soon the babies learn to suck in return for music, gaining weight faster and going home earlier than those who do not use the device. Even perfectly healthy people are discovering the power of music to calm and heal. Drum circles attract people who find stress relief in beating out rhythms. While music is not a cure-all, it does make life a little easier. What is the best title for this passage?", "subject": ""}

The law is known as COOL -- Country of Origin Labeling . American congress first passed the law in 2002. Stores have had to label seafood by country of origin since 2005. But industry pressure delayed other requirements until last week. Products that must now be labeled include fresh fruits and vegetables, muscle meats and some kinds of nuts. But the rules are complex, and many foods are not included. For example, organ meats are free to be labeled. So are processed foods, including cooked or smoked foods. The same food may sometimes have to be labeled and other times not. Fresh or frozen peas, for example, have to be labeled but not canned peas. Foods that are mixed with other foods are also excluded. Mixed nuts, for example, do not need to be labeled. The same is true of a salad mix that contains different things like lettuce and carrots. Or a fruit cup that combines different fruits. Also, the law doesn't include restaurants and other food service organizations. Department of Agriculture officials say the law is really meant for larger grocery stores. The United States has imported more and more food in recent years to save money and expand choices. Country-of-origin labeling has become more common lately but has still been limited in many stores. Food safety is one reason why some shoppers pay close attention to where foods came from. For example, when a large number of people recently got sick from salmonella , officials blamed peppers from Mexico. Yet the last big food scare involved spinach grown in California. But labeling is also a way for people to know they are getting what they want. Some want to buy local foods or foods from a particular country. The country-of-origin labeling law gives stores 30 days to correct any violations  that are found. Stores and suppliers that are found to be deliberately violating the law could be fined 1,000 dollars per violation. Federal inspectors are not to take action to enforce the law for six months to give time for an education campaign. Some food safety activists say they are generally pleased with the law.

In order to reduce global warming we need to make our carbon footprints smaller. But how much CO2are we responsible for? A new book by Mike Berners Lee, an expert, might be able to help. The carbon footprint looks at the different things we do and buy, and calculates the amount of CO2all of the following created: the ingredients, the electricity, the equipment, the travel and commuting of the beer, and the packaging. It's amazing how many different things need to be included in each calculation. And it's frightening how much carbon dioxide everything produces. This can help us decide which beer to drink. From Berners Lee's calculations, it's clear that a pint (568ml) of locally _ beer has a smaller carbon footprint than a bottle of imported beer. This is because the imported beer has been transported from far away, and it uses more packaging. The local beer only produces 300g of CO2, but the imported beer produces 900g! So, one pint of local beer is better for the environment. Berners Lee has even calculated the carbon footprint of cycling to work. Nothing is more environmentally friendly than riding a bike, surely? Well, it depends on what you've had to eat before. To ride a bike we need energy and for energy we need food. So if we eat a banana and then ride a kilometer, our footprint is 65g of CO2. However, if we eat bacon before the ride, it's 200g. In fact, bananas are good because they don't need packaging, they can be transported by boat and they grow in natural sunlight. So, does this mean that cycling is bad for the environment? Absolutely not, for a start, if you cycle, you don't use your car, and the fewer cars on the road, the fewer traffic jams. And cars in traffic jams produce three times more CO2than cars traveling at speed. Cycling also makes you healthy and less likely to go to hospital.

A new study used a computer model to predict how just three grams less a day would affect heart disease in the United States. The result: thirteen percent fewer heart attacks. Eight percent fewer strokes. Four percent fewer deaths. Eleven percent fewer new cases of heart disease. And two hundred forty billion dollars in health care savings.  Researchers found it could prevent one hundred thousand heart attacks and ninety-two thousand deaths every year. The study is in the New England Journal of Medicine. Kirsten, at the University of California, was the lead author. She says people would not even notice a difference in taste with three grams, or one-half teaspoon, less salt per day. The team also included researchers at Stanford and Columbia University. Each gram of salt contains four hundred milligrams of sodium, which is how foods may list their salt content. The government says the average American man eats ten grams of salt a day. The American Heart Association advises no more than three grams for healthy people. It says salt in the American diet has increased fifty percent since the nineteen seventies, while blood pressures have also risen. Less salt can mean a lower blood pressure. New York City Mayor Michael Bloomberg is leading an effort called the National Salt Reduction Initiative. The idea is to put pressure on food companies and restaurants.

Work, in this small community, was as slow as his broken Pontiac. But he never quit looking. Since the factory closed, he'd been unemployed. And with winter approaching, the cold days had finally hit home. It was a lonely road. Very few people had a reason to be on it, unless they were leaving. Most of his friends had left. But he stayed on. After all, he had his root here. It was getting dark, and snow was coming down. He'd better get a move on. Suddenly he saw an old lady on the roadside and obviously needed help. So he pulled up in front of her Mercedes and got out. She was worried. No one had stopped to help for the last hour or so. Was he going to hurt her? He looked poor, hungry, and ... dangerous. He could see that she was frightened, standing out there in the cold. He said, \"I'm here to help you, Ma'am. Why don't you wait in the car where it's warm? By the way, my name is Joe.\" The car had a flat tire. Joe crawled under the car and soon he was able to change the tire. But he had to get dirty and his hands hurt. As he was turning the screws ,she rolled down her window and began talking to him and said she couldn't thank him enough for coming to her aid.  She asked him how much she owed him. Any amount would have been alright with her. She had already imagined all the terrible things that could have happened had he not stopped. Joe never thought twice about the money. This was simply helping someone in need, and God knows there were plenty who had lent him a hand before. He had lived his whole life that way, and it never occurred to him to act any other way. He told her that if she really wanted to pay him back, the next time she saw someone who needed help, she could give that person the assistance they needed, and Joe added \"... and think of me.\" A few miles down the road the lady saw a small cafe. She went in to grab a bite to eat, and take the chill off. It was a dirty-looking restaurant. Outside were two old gas pumps. The whole scene was unfamiliar to her. The waitress came over and brought a clean towel to wipe her wet hair. She had a sweet smile, one that even being on her feet for the whole day couldn't erase.

If you need anything, just wave at me!\" After he had finished a hearty meal of pancakes, bacon, and lemon tea, Mary brought him the change, helping him up from his chair and out from behind the table.

As we were turning into the rest area, we heard a loud banging sound again, and all I could do was get this car pulled over and stopped. Once we got stopped, and tire pulled off, we found that the bolt  ,which is necessary for the brake to work, had been missing. Had I hit the brake with any more speed, I am sure the car would have turned over and we could have all been killed. The first thing we needed to do was get a new bolt, so my husband went to get a cup of coffee and to ask whether there would be an auto parts store. They told him where, and then he came back to find we had no way to get there. _ One of the coffee volunteers was getting off her shift and offered to take him to the auto parts store. So this angel took him to Ellensburg to get the part, only to find out that it was the wrong part. So she came back to see if everything fit and sure enough, she offered to take him to the hardware store in town to see if they could find this bolt! She spent well over 4 hours with us, driving us around to help fix our car and protect us until we were safe. She even followed us for a short time on the freeway until she knew we were well on our way safely.

Yao finished with 2,342,738 votes; Bryant had 2,271,631 in the closest finish among the top two players in All-Star balloting since Vince Carter, then of Toronto, edged Miami's Alonzo Mourning by 33,385 votes in 2000.

On the other hand, there are many persons who cannot afford to buy books, because some of them are quite expensive, but they usually go to libraries and spend hours reading something that interests them a lot, or just borrow books to read at home. From my point of view, literature is very important in our lives from several points of view. For e xample, reading is a means of gaining culture and enriching our knowledge in different areas of activities. It can help us have a great imagination and it makes things easier when it comes to making compositions on different themes. It gives you the possibility to speak about science, even if you don't work in this field, or you can express your opinion about a political aspect, just because you have read something conne cted to that. Secondly, literature offers us the possibility to enter the world of imagination, and to leave apart the real one for a couple of hours.

{"answer": 1, "choices": ["The Development of Autopilot", "Technology of Future Travel", "A New Driving System", "Computerized Cars"], "question": "Did you know that there are actually people who have paid for a flight to the moon? In the future, there will be a lot more opportunities to travel to faraway places than now... perhaps even as far as the moon. As people adventure further and further away and as planes, trains, cars, and rocket ships become faster, is it safer to have these vehicles controlled by humans or by computers? While many flights by plane are controlled automatically by machines, most people today wouldn't let their car drive itself. That's because currently the autopilot function on your car can only keep it on the same course you are travelling on. It won't turn the car right or left. It won't stop if an animal jumps in the way. However, cars today can sense when something is too close and warn the driver with flashing lights and alarms. Many cars also have GPS(global positioning systems) that tell drivers which road to take and when to turn. These systems, unlike human drivers, never get lost. In the future, it is easy to believe that your car will be better able to drive itself with the aid of computers that can determine the position of your car and the speed it should travel at. In addition to computers being 'smarter' than people regarding the best way to go or knowing how close another vehicle is, computers don't get sick, tired, or angry. This means they won't make the same mistakes that people make when they are not having a good day. While responding with emotion is a good thing when choosing the best way to deal with a friend's personal problem, it may not be such a good thing when deciding what to do at the wheel of a fast-moving vehicle. So what are the disadvantages of autopilot systems? Maybe one disadvantage is that a small computer problem could cause a serious accident.

{"answer": 3, "choices": ["Scurvy", "Pellagra", "Rickets", "All of the above"], "question": "Vitamins are complex chemical substances found in many foods. The human body needs them for health and growth. The body makes some vitamins, but usually in amounts too small to meet its needs. Other vitamins are not made in the body. These must be supplied. No one knows exactly how all vitamins work. Doctors do know that vitamins have very special uses. One vitamin therefore cannot take the place of another. The steady absence of one vitamin in an otherwise complete diet causes a deficiency disease. Rickets, scurvy, and pellagra are examples of deficiency diseases.  It is best to obtain vitamins by eating the foods in which they occur. There are also pills that contain a single vitamin or a combination of vitamins people should consult their doctors before they take any vitamin pills. Scientists have discovered about 25 vitamins and their different forms that are very important to human beings and other forms of life. Experts believe that there are many more vitamins to be discovered. There are two basic groups of vitamins. One group of vitamins dissolves in fat and is therefore called the \"fat-soluble\" group. Vitamins A, D, E and K are in this group. The other group is known as \"water-soluble\" vitamins. These vitamins, understandably, dissolve in water. Among this group are Vitamin C and the B group of vitamins. Vitamin A aids the building and growth of body cells. This vitamin is therefore vital for the growth of children and for good development of babies before birth. Vitamin A is also important for good vision at night. Vitamin B1 is also called thiamine. This vitamin prevents and cures disease. Vitamin B2, called riboflavin, is needed for growth, healthy skin, and for the eyes. Vitamin C, or ascorbic acid, prevents and cures scurvy. Vitamin D is a group of 10 vitamins that prevents rickets. Scientist believe that Vitamin D3 forms in the skin when the body is exposed to sunlight. Because of this, it is called the \"sunshine vitamin\". A lack of Vitamin D may lead to bone damage; too much may cause kidney disease.   All of the functions of Vitamin E, also called tocopherol, are not known. It is necessary for reproduction in animals. Vitamin K is necessary for making the blood clot. The more that is learned about vitamins, the more it is realized how these chemical substances play a part in all aspects of human activity.

The deal means that Rowling's long-standing relationship with Bloomsbury, the London-based publisher that launched the Harry Potter books, has come to an end, at least in terms of new works by the author. Rowling, who is worth an estimated PS530 million, said that the new novel will be nothing like the Harry Potter series, which sold over 30 million copies in the UK alone. She said that with the move from children's to adult fiction, a move to a new publisher seemed like a logical step.  Item 2:  China's hurdler Liu Xiang was disqualified Thursday at the Stockholm indoor athletics tournament due to false start, giving his rival Dayron Robles of Cuba an easy win of 7.66 seconds. Liu was not willing to explain the reason of his false start, but he told Xinhua that it was not related to his foot injury. Another Cuban Orlando Ortega followed in 7.68 seconds and Balazs Baji of Hungary stood third in 7.70 seconds. Last Saturday, Liu won the men's 60m hurdle final in 7.41 seconds at the Birmingham indoor tournament, setting a new Asian record.

Researchers say a lack of sleep can produce hormonal  changes that increase feelings of hunger. In one study, researchers in the United States examined information on more than 1000 people. The people had taken part in a long-term study of sleep disorders. Some people slept less than five hours a night. They had 15 percent higher blood levels of a hormone called ghrelin than people who slept eight hours. And they had 15 percent less of the hormone leptin. Experts say ghrelin helps make people feel hungry; leptin makes you feel full. The scientists say these hormonal changes may be a cause of obesity in Western societies. They note the combination that sleep limitation is common and food is widely available. The results were not affected by how much people exercised. People who are awake longer have more time to burn energy. But the researchers say loss of sleep may increase hunger especially for high-calorie foods, so people gain weight.

Those who worked more than 35 hours were likely to gain weight compared to those who worked fewer hours or were out of the workforce. What's more, the more hours a woman worked in a week, the more weight she gained.  The authors of the Australian study attribute weight gain among working women to inactivity, lack of time for food preparation, more use of prepared foods, high levels of stress, lack of sleep and consuming more alcohol. I'll also add in travel, meals eaten out and working at night as other factors that I can find to make balancing work with a healthy diet a challenge.

I was attending a stand-up comedy show in Egypt, and when the man started to make fun of pedestrians crossing streets, everyone laughed their hearts out.The main reason those people strongly laughed was that almost all of them felt angry towards pedestrians who crossed streets carelessly.The joke wasn't only funny, it also made the audience feel that they were right about being angry at those pedestrians.That is, people were laughing both because of the funny joke and because of the happiness experienced as a result of the psychological support they got. The better a joke makes a person feel, and the more it includes other psychological factors, the more the person will like it.For example, if you envy one of your friends, and someone tells a joke that is funny and, at the same time, makes your friend seem stupid, then you will probably laugh at it louder than if you weren't jealous of him. In short, we don't laugh only when we hear something funny; we also laugh when we experience some kind of happiness that results from the other psychological factors involved in the joke.I strongly discourage making fun of anyone or belittling someone to make someone else laugh.All I want to explain is that if your joke supports a person's emotions, he will certainly like it a lot.

Only a hospital had what he needed, but it was 700 mile-away! In January, it was too dangerous to send a boat and too stormy for his tiny airplane. The only hope was to use several sled dog teams following a trail, called the Iditarod Trail. They passed the medicine from one sled team to another.

{"answer": 2, "choices": ["toy retailers", "shoe designers", "female consumers", "make-up producers"], "question": "Years ago, the American writer Kurt Vonnegut often said there was one story that would always make a million dollars: Cinderella. In Hollywood and in today's economy, it is more like $70 million and that is just a start. \"Cinderella\" made that amount in ticket sales when it opened last weekend. But the merchandising deals linked to the movie are also hugely valuable. So the artistic success of the film is open to debate. What is clear, however, is the movie's business success. It is a hit in the theaters but it is also a hit in retail  . And Disney widened its usual market for \"Cinderella\" products. There are products connected to the Disney film targeted not only at little girls, but women, too. For example, the famous shoe designer Jimmy Choo partnered with Disney to create a version of Cinderella's \"glass slippers\" or shoes. You can buy them for about $5,000. At that price, you would not want to lose one at the ball, even if that is the way you get your prince. Several other shoemakers also accepted Disney deals to design versions of the famous footwear. The makeup company MAC quickly sold all its products with official links to \"Cinderella.\" But lucky buyers were soon selling the products on the online marketplace eBay for many times the original price. HSN is a popular television and online retailer   of jewelry, clothing and objects for the home. The marketer is now an exclusive seller of \"Cinderella\" products. So, is there anything left for the children, those people we think of as the traditional audience for the age-old fairy tale? Yes, you can find toys and other children's products at the American retailer JC Penney. Of course, you can also visit a Disney store. Disney also produced an animated version of \"Cinderella.\" It came out in 1950 and is considered a classic. Which do you think the Disney company does better: live action   or animated films?
