Those who have been there say it feels like being robbed of your identity and is as painful as the loss of a loved one. It may be hard to believe at first, but finally you can use this experience as your advantage--to find another, perhaps even better job, to strengthen your relationship with your family, and to make some much-needed changes in your life. Here are three essential steps. Step1 Get emotional support. Because it's easy to feel uneasy and vulnerable , turning to others is the key to making a smooth transition . You'll need people who will listen and provide a safe place for you to cry, or to express your fears and concerns. Don't go it alone. It takes courage to ask for help, and yet, help may be what you need most to move forward. Step2 Seek professional guidance. Getting assistance from a recruiter  or career adviser will not only help you value your experience and improve your skills, it also will ensure that you put your best foot forward. Once again, your local unemployment office should have helpful resources. If possible, try not to let fear cause you to grab the first new job you're offered (unless it's the right one). Give yourself time to explore different choices. Step3 _ . Meet with family members to openly discuss your feelings. Listen carefully without interrupting one another, and give everyone a turn to speak. When a man I know did this with his family, his wife agreed to leave the job search planning to him and his outplacement adviser. In turn, he agreed to keep her informed about the process on a weekly basis. When you keep the lines of communication open, you can build stronger relationships. Once you've got a new job, create your own security. Keep your resume up-to-date, stay in touch with recruiters about the job market, and constantly improve your skills to stay marketable in your field. Although being laid-off can turn your life upside down, many people say that it gave them push they needed to start a new life!

Unfortunately, when many of these chemicals are used, more damage is caused to the environment, especially to lives in the sea. But governments seem to accept the _ of transporting mil-lions of tons of oil by ship every day so that we can fill up our cars and drive around and cause even more environmental damage.

Of all of today's environmental disasters, an oil spill may actually be one of the least serious. Although oil is poisonous, it is a natural material. In the end, it breaks down naturally. In 1967 the tanker Torrey Canyon sank off the Scilly Isles near the coast of England and spilled 120,000 tons of oil into the ocean. If you go there today, you will find it hard to see any sign that it ever happened. However, we should be thinking more about reducing our dependency on oil. Governments should be encouraging research into new technologies, such as cars run by solar power, electricity, hydro-gen, and so on. Much of this research, in the past, was stopped by the oil, gas, and coal. If the world's millions of cars were 10% more efficient  ,we would need many fewer tankers crossing the oceans each year.

One of the least understood involves the peculiar roles of producer or \"provider\" and purchaser or \"consumer\" in the typical doctor-patient relationship. In most sectors of the economy, it is the seller who attempts to attract a potential buyer with various appealing factors of price, quality, and use, and it is the buyer who makes the decision. Such condition, however, is not common in most of the health-care industry. In the health-care industry, the doctor-patient relationship is the mirror image of the ordinary relationship between producer and consumer. Once an individual has chosen to see a physician -- and even then there may be no real choice -- it is the physician who usually makes all significant purchasing decisions: whether the patient should return \"next Wednesday\", whether X-rays are needed, whether drugs should be prescribed, etc. It is rare that a patient will challenge such professional decisions or raise in advance questions about price, especially when the disease is regarded as serious. This is particularly significant in relation to hospital care. The physician must certify the need for hospitalization, determine what procedures will be performed, and announce when the patient may be discharged. The patient may be consulted about some of the decisions, but in general it is the doctor's judgments that are final. Little wonder then that in the eye of the hospital it is the physician who is the real \"consumer\". As a consequence, the medical staff represents the \"power center\" in hospital policy and decision-making, not the administration. Although usually there are in this situation four identifiable participants-- the physician, the hospital, the patient, and the payer (generally an insurance carrier or government)-- the physician makes the essential decisions for all of them.

But this battery uses more efficient bacteria that can turn 80 percent of sugar into electrical energy. This is 30 percent more than similar batteries can manage.    The bacteria battery could become as small as a household battery. It's also cheap and stable, as sugar can be taken from waste and crops.     But the sugar to electricity process is slow: it could take weeks for the bacteria to digest a cup of sugar.And it produces \"greenhouse\" gases which pollute the environment.

{"answer": 3, "choices": ["Habitats were lost.", "Natural disasters struck.", "Native cultures disappeared.", "Foreign languages were spoken."], "question": "Can a Language Become Extinct? A language can become extinct when the last person who can speak it passes away. Or more likely when the secondlast person who speaks it dies because then there is no one left to talk to. According to linguists   there is nothing unusual about a single language dying out. But what is happening today is quite remarkable. According to the recent statistics, there are approximately 6,000 languages in the world as we speak. Of these, about half are going to die out in the next century. There are several reasons as to why a language can eventually die out. These range from natural disasters, such as hurricanes, to sociological factors, like cultural assimilation, in which the culture of a minority group is gradually replaced by a stronger one. The former can cause tribes to leave their natural habitat  and therefore become fewer and fewer in number. However, it doesn't happen very frequently. In fact, the latter is a much bigger threat and it is responsible for the extinction of a lot of languages in countries like the USA and Australia. For instance, Chemehuevi is one of the languages which is really close to dying out since its sole speaker is an old, yet healthy, man named Johnny Hill, Jr. It is very important for as many languages as possible to be preserved. Scientists have been trying to raise people's awareness on how certain tribes have specific words which cannot be expressed in let's say English simply because there is no equal meaning. Namely, the Yupik of Alaska have 99 names to describe different layers of ice formation, or how the Tofa of Siberia classify reindeer  . In other words, when languages die out, mankind's wisdom reduces. On a happier note, there are many famous cases which show what can be done to preserve languages in danger of extinction. In particular, the Maori in New Zealand have created socalled \"language nests\": organizations which help children under five learn the language. They provide them with a setting where they are exposed to the language intensively so that they get to realise that communicating in Maori is as natural as communicating in English. There is always, of course, the risk that the children won't keep the language alive after they have left their \"nests\". Nevertheless, hope dies hard.

The three types are skeletal  muscles, smooth muscles and cardiac, or heart muscles. Each kind of muscle has a special job to do.

Skeletal muscles give us strength and allow us to move in many ways. If you look at skeletal muscles through a microscope, you will see that it has bands of fibers that look like stripes . These stripes are called striations. Skeletal muscles usually move because the brain has sent a conscious message to them telling them what to do. This is called voluntary movement. Another type of muscle is smooth muscle. Unlike skeletal muscle, smooth muscle does not have striations. This is found in organs such as the stomach, the bladder , the lungs and the eyes. Smooth muscles are smaller than the skeletal muscles and they move involuntarily. The brain tells these muscles what to do, but we aren't even aware of it. For example, we don't have to think about breathing or digesting food. The smooth muscles just do their jobs automatically. For this reason smooth muscles are sometimes called involuntary muscles. Like smooth muscle, cardiac muscle also works involuntarily. It is a very thick muscle that is found only in the walls of the heart.

Researchers found women infected with the Toxoplasma gondii (T. gondii) parasite , which is spread through contact with cat waste or eating undercooked meat or unwashed vegetables, are at increased risk of attempting suicide. The study involved more than 45,000 women in Denmark. About a third of the world's population is infected with the parasite, which hides in cells in the brain and muscles, often without producing symptoms. The infection, which is called toxoplasmosis , has been linked to mental illness, such as schizophrenia , and changes in behavior. The study's senior author Doctor Teodor Postolache, an associate professor of psychiatry  at the University of Maryland School of Medicine in the United States, said, \"We can't say with certainty that T. gondii caused the women to try to kill themselves, but we did find a predictive association between the infection and suicide attempts later in life that deserves additional studies.\" Doctor Albert Reece, vice president of medical affairs at the University of Maryland, said, \"T. gondii infection is a major public health problem around the world, and many people don't realize they're infected. \"Dr Postolache is a leading expert on suicide neuroimmunology . Suicide is a critically important mental health issue. About one million people commit suicide and another 10 million attempt suicide worldwide each year. We hope that this type of research will one day help us find ways to save many lives that now end too early in suicide.\" Dr. Postolache's research team at the University of Maryland was the first to report a connection between T. gondii and suicidal behavior in 2009. He is cooperating with researchers in Denmark, Germany and Sweden to confirm and investigate the way leading to this association. The T. gondii parasite thrives in the intestines of cats, and it is spread through their waste. All warm-blooded animals can become infected through contact with it. Humans can become infected by changing their infected cats' litter boxes, eating unwashed vegetables, drinking water from a polluted source, or by eating undercooked or raw meat. Not washing kitchen knives after preparing raw meat before handling another food item also can lead to infection. Pregnant women can pass the parasite directly to their unborn babies and are advised not to change cat litter boxes to avoid possible infection. Babies don't produce antibodies to T. gondii for three months after they are born, so the antibodies present in their blood represented infection in the mothers. The scientists studied Danish health patients to determine if any of these women later attempted suicide, including cases of violent suicide attempts which may have involved guns, sharp instruments and jumping from high places. The study found that women infected with T. gondii were one and a half times more likely to attempt suicide compared to those who were not infected, and the risk seemed to rise with increasing levels of the T. gondii antibodies.

He is cooperating with researchers in Denmark, Germany and Sweden to confirm and investigate the way leading to this association. The T. gondii parasite thrives in the intestines of cats, and it is spread through their waste. All warm-blooded animals can become infected through contact with it. Humans can become infected by changing their infected cats' litter boxes, eating unwashed vegetables, drinking water from a polluted source, or by eating undercooked or raw meat. Not washing kitchen knives after preparing raw meat before handling another food item also can lead to infection. Pregnant women can pass the parasite directly to their unborn babies and are advised not to change cat litter boxes to avoid possible infection. Babies don't produce antibodies to T. gondii for three months after they are born, so the antibodies present in their blood represented infection in the mothers. The scientists studied Danish health patients to determine if any of these women later attempted suicide, including cases of violent suicide attempts which may have involved guns, sharp instruments and jumping from high places. The study found that women infected with T. gondii were one and a half times more likely to attempt suicide compared to those who were not infected, and the risk seemed to rise with increasing levels of the T. gondii antibodies. Dr Postolache noted limitations to the study, such as the inability to determine the cause of the suicidal behavior. The findings were published online in the Archives of General Psychiatry.

First of all, we had to meet outside the school building. I was very nervous because my primary school only had 300 pupils but in the secondary school there are about 1,300. What a difference! The older pupils are really big. I felt so small waiting there in front of the school. The other problem was that I didn't know anyone. My family moved over the summer holidays, because of Dad's new job. So now I have to try to make some new friends. Standing in front of the school this morning, I wanted to be back at my old school with my old friends. The head teacher came out and told us to go into the school hall.

We aren't allowed to use the lift. I couldn't believe it. When we were walking up all the stairs I started talking to another boy who didn't know anyone.

The farther they are, the longer trips they make around the sun. People noticed long ago that these traveling bodies moved around in the sky in definite paths. It is a force called gravity that holds them in their paths. We know that every little bit of matter in the universe pulls upon every other bit of matter. The pull between two bodies is proportional   to the product of their masses. Because the sun is so large the pull between the sun and the planets are thus great. If it were not for this pull, the planets would fly off into space. In the same way there exists a pull between the earth and the moon, which keeps the moon traveling in its orbit around our planet, the earth. Gravity holds you to its surface, and pulls back to it the ball which you throw into the air. Of course the ball also pulls on the larger earth but the earth is so much larger that the pull is not noticed.

Liu, 23, who is in her final year of a BSc in business administration at the University of Bath, is one of more than 80,000 Chinese students studying in UK universities. They are responsible for a large proportion of the more than PS10bn a year that international students contribute to the UK economy. However, research shows that where their academic attainment  is concerned, the picture is not satisfactory. While nearly 58% of all students - and 45% of overseas students graduated with a first-class degree last year, this was true of only 35% of students from China. To find an explanation, Zhiqi Wang and Ian Crawford, lecturers at the University of Bath, compared the performance of Chinese and British undergraduates in each year of their degree. Taking a sample of 100 British and Chinese students and comparing their average marks and final degree classification, they found a dramatic drop in performance among the Chinese students between year one, when they performed better than their UK counterparts, and year two, when they performed worse. They believe the drop results from two factors. First, Chinese students fail to adapt their approaches to learning and so their performance declines in the later years when the complexity of the work increases. Second, many young people in China enroll in higher education due to pressure from family rather than their own motivation. Professor Sedghi thinks part of the problem may be the changing socio-economic background of Chinese undergraduates. While 85% of Chinese students at British universities before 2000 were mature students, often funded by the government, since 2004, however, they have been younger, most funded by their families.

While 85% of Chinese students at British universities before 2000 were mature students, often funded by the government, since 2004, however, they have been younger, most funded by their families. Maybe UK institutions need to work harder to take into account what a big challenge it is for young people from a radically different culture and linguistic background to adapt to life in the UK. \"We need to do more, contacting students before their arrival, assigning them tutors, encouraging peer-assisted learning, for example,\" says Sedghi.

Do you avoid going to certain places, seeing friends or doing certain things because of your worries? Do your worries keep you awake at night? If you've answered yes, you may be suffering from anxiety.          Anxiety is a normal and necessary part of life. Anxiety is your brain's way of telling you about danger. It is anxiety which helps you jump out of the way if a car is speeding towards you. But if it gets out of hand, anxiety can get in the way of you getting on with life and can become a real problem. If this is the case for you, treatment may be a helpful way for you to get your anxiety under control.          Anxiety is a normal part of life. Some people may feel uneasy if moving to a new place and some may get overly anxious in certain situations. There are lots of reasons for this. One main reason is after a stressful thing which has happened in your life. So, if you are involved in a car crash, it's quite likely that you will be more worried than other people around cars and driving.          Being anxious also probably runs in families. If your parents suffer from anxiety then you are more likely to be anxious too. This is probably partly due to genetics, and partly because of how things are when you're growing up.          Even though people don't talk about it much, anxiety is one of the most common mental health problems. About 1 in 4 people will have an anxiety problem at some time in their life.          If you have an anxiety problem it's hard for other people to understand why something that doesn't worry them, like being in a crowd of people, can be so scary for you. This can make you feel separated and lonely, as may become worse and worse.          The good news is there are lots of excellent treatments available for anxiety.

They are proud of their healthy color when they return home after the holiday. But they also know that a certain amount of sunshine is good for their bodies and general health. In ancient Greece people knew about the healing  powers of the sun, but this knowledge was lost. At the end of the nineteenth century a Danish doctor, Niels Finsen, began to study the effect of sunlight on certain diseases, especially diseases of the skin. He was interested not only in natural sunlight but also in artificially   produced rays. Sunlight began to play a more important part in curing sick people. A Swiss doctor, Auguste Rollier, made full use of the sun in his hospital at Lysine. Lysine is a small village high up in the Alps. The position is important: the rays of the sun with the greatest healing power are the infra-red   and ultra-violet   rays; but ultra-violet rays are too easily lost in fog and the polluted air near industrial towns. Dr. Roller found that sunlight, fresh air and good food cure a great many diseases. He was particularly successful in curing certain forms of tuberculosis with his \"sun-cure\". There were a large number of children in Dr. Roller's hospital. He decided to start a school where sick children could be cured and at the same time continue to learn. It was not long before his school was full. In winter, wearing only shorts, socks and boots, the children put on their skis after breakfast and left the hospital. They carried small desks and chairs as well as their school books. Their teacher led them over the snow until they reached a slope which faced the sun and was free from cold winds. There they set out their desks and chairs, and school began. Although they wore hardly any clothes, Roller's pupils were very seldom cold. That was because their bodies were full of energy which they got from the sun. But the doctor knew that sunshine can also be dangerous. If, for example, tuberculosis is attacking the lungs, unwise sunbathing may do great harm. Today there is not just one school in the sun. There are several in Switzerland, and since Switzerland is not the only country which has the right conditions, there are similar schools in other places.

According to Bupa, a British healthcare organization, which asked 12262 people in 12 countries about their attitudes toward aging, 28 percent of the Chinese polled said they feel depressed when they think about getting old. And although 72 percent of all respondents aged 65 and over said they do not feel old, the survey conducted in June and July this year found more than half of those aged 45 to 54 in China already consider themselves to be elderly. About 30 percent of Chinese respondents said they worry about who will look after them in later years, while 91 percent agreed the government of the world's most populous nation should improve care for the elderly. However, because people in China think about their future earlier, research suggests the country could be one of the best prepared for addressing the aging problem. About one third of Chinese respondents--more than double the global average--said they have put money aside for retirement, while 46 percent have taken out insurance, the poll showed. Despite being one of the best prepared nations, three fifths of those surveyed in China expect their family to care for them when they can no longer do so themselves. A Bupa-sponsored report,however, revealed that the \"informal care network\" (the traditional pattern of families looking after the elderly) is disintegrating. This is due to a number of factors, said the report, including structural changes to the population, the increase of women in employment, the increase of one-person households and the rise in divorce rates. The first batch of Chinese couples with only one child are largely in their 50s or 60s because the country's family planning policy was adopted in the late 1970s. Li Yinping, 55, a retired accountant, said she thinks only people in their 70s can be called old. She said her pension is enough to support her in later years and that her only hope is that her son can visit regularly. \"I don't worry about my later years at all,\" said Li. \"When I'm old, I can turn to a rest home.

That could be good for the environment, because cars use lots of gas and give off pollution. Green buildings are often built on developed land, so that the buildings don't destroy forests. Marty Dettling is the project manager for a building that put these ideas into action.  The Solaire has been called the country's first green high-rise building. According to Dettling, \"We've reduced our energy use by one-third and our water by 50 percent.\" The Solaire cuts energy in part by using solar power. \"On the lace  of the building we have solar panels which change the sun's energy into electricity,\" Dettling explained. The Solaire also has lights that automatically turn off when people leave the room. In addition, the building has lots of windows, allowing people to use the sun for light during the day. The Solaire cuts water by reusing it. Not everyone is eager to move into a green building, however. Some people think that things like solar panels cost more money than more traditional energy sources. Anyhow, Holowka said, \"It's going to be big.\" Which of the following statements is WRONG?", "subject": ""}

{"answer": 2, "choices": ["is the world's oldest mattress factory", "make mattresses for sports", "produces mattresses by hand", "hires athletes as mattress testers"], "question": "The next time you get caught jumping on your bed you can tell your parents with a straight face that you are not playing, simply getting ready got a promising career in \"Mattress Jumping\". Believe it or not, there are some people who actually get paid to do that! According to Reuben Reynoso, a professional mattress tester at San Francisco's McRoskey Mattress Factory that still makes every mattress by hand, it is real work and needs some training. For a start, it's not all about jumping to new heights or doing tricks like professional athletes, but rather about feeling each area of the mattress carefully to detect the filling. In order to do it right, every bit of the mattress has to be tested slowly and deliberately. Over the years, Reynoso has figured out the perfect routine. He begins by placing a protective mat over the mattress so that it doesn't get dirty or absorb the smell from his feet. Then begins the fun---he steps to the middle of an edge and then takes five steps back and five steps forward. In this way, he slowly but surely, covers the entire surface.

Many sleep experts hope it will be _  According to a poll  by the National Sleep Foundation, nearly 4 in 5 Americans don't get as much sleep as they should during the workweek. On average, adults are thought to need at least eight hours of sleep a night, although some can manage with less and some won't do well without more. But the survey found that, on workdays, only 21% of Americans actually get a full eight hours of sleep, and another 21% get less than six. To many of us, the thought of spending more time sleeping is, well, a big yawn. On the other hand, the thought of being smarter, thinner, healthier and more cheerful has a certain appeal. And those are just a few of the advantages that can be ours if we consistently get enough sleep, researchers say. Also on the plus side: We're likely to have better skin, better memories, better judgment, and, oh, yes, longer lives. \"When you lose even one hour of sleep for any reason, it influences your performance the next day,\" says Dr. Alon Avidan, director of the UCLA Sleep Disorders Center. A study published last year found the same to be true even of children. When kids aged 8 to 12 slept for just one hour less for four nights, they didn't function as well during the day. But sleeping has an image problem. \"We see napping or sleeping as lazy,\" says Jennifer Vriend, a clinical psychologist in Ottawa, Canada, and the leading author of the study with children. \"We put so much emphasis on diet, nutrition and exercise. Sleep is in the back seat.\"  In fact, she adds, no matter how much we work out, no matter how well we eat, we can't be in top physical shape unless we also get plenty of sleep.

Some baboons were given the chance to watch another baboon who already knew how to solve the task, while others had to learn for themselves. To work out how brave or anxious the baboons were, Dr. Carter presented them either with a novel food or a threat in the form of a model of a poisonous snake. She found that personality had a major impact on learning. The braver baboons learnt, but the shy ones did not learn the task although they watched the baboon perform the task of finding the novel food just as long as the brave ones did. In effect, despite being made aware of what to do, they were still too shy to do what the experienced baboon did. The same held true for anxious baboons compared with calm ones. The anxious individuals learnt the task by observing others while those who were relaxed did not, even though they spent more time watching. This _ between collecting social information and using it shows that personality plays a key role in social learning in animals, something that has previously been ignored in studies on how animals learn to do things. The findings are significant because they suggest that animals may perform poorly in cognitive ( )tasks not because they aren't clever enough to solve them,but because they are too shy or nervous to use the social information. The findings may impact how we understand the formation of culture in societies through social learning.

Dear Unemployed, Before you get              yourself in a really bad situation, you need to stop borrowing money from people. If you continue doing that,you will be deep in debts and the situation will get even worse for you.

And the last thing I will suggest is that you should stop feeling sorry for yourself and continue working hard to get a job that you need. Borrowing money, complaining, and feeling bad for your situation will              do no good to you.

Jack Ma,whose Chinese name is Ma Yun,was born in a normal family in 1964.Like most Chinese parents back then,Ma's father beat him growing up.He was poor at math but loved English.Starting at age 12,he awoke at 5a.m.to walk or bicycle to Hangzhou's main hotels so he could practice his English with foreign tourists.He did this for nine years and acted as a free tour guide to many,befriended several and later visited one family in Australia.Those experiences opened his eyes. After twice failing the national college entrance exams,Ma entered what he called\"Hangzhou's worst college.\"Graduating in 1988,Ma married his college sweetheart and taught English at a local college for five years,earning 15a month.During that time,he also applied for jobs at a local KFC,a hotel and the city police,and failed to land.

For example, some people believe that wearing glasses too soon weakens the eyes. But there is no evidence to show that the structure of eyes is changed by wearing glasses at young age. Wearing the wrong glasses, however, can prove harmful. Studies show that for adults there is no danger, but children can develop loss of sight if they have glasses unsuitable for their eyes.     We have all heard some of the common myths about how eyesight gets bad. Most people believe that reading in weak light causes poor eyesight, but that is untrue. Too little light makes the eyes work harder, so they do get tired and strained. Eyestrain also results from reading a lot, reading in bed, and watching too much television. However, although eyestrain may cause some pain or headaches, it does not damage eyesight in the long term.     Another myth about eyes is that they can be replaced, or transplanted from one person to another.

It is easy to grow your own sprouts, but you need to buy your seeds from supermarkets or health food stores. Seeds for planting in the garden are often powdered with chemicals, so when becoming sprouts they are not safe to eat. Try growing sprouts from a variety of beans and seeds. You will find different sprouts at different stages. Bean sprouts are best when they are about three centimeters long. Wheat and sunflower sprouts taste best when the sprouts and the seeds are of the same length. If the sunflower sprout is too long it leaves a funny stinging feeling in the throat after eating. Alfalfa sprouts are best when their small leaves are well developed. Pea and soybean sprouts are good long or short. If you leave your sprouts in filtered sunlight for a few hours, the leaves will turn green as chlorophyll   is added. Eating sprouts with green leaves benefits your blood, cells, and the digestive system. Which of the following is NOT true according to the passage?", "subject": ""}

At first,the music played bore no special relationship to the films;an accompaniment of any kind was sufficient.Within a very short time, however the _ of playing lively music to a serious film became apparent,and film pianists began to take some care in matching their pieces to the mood of the film. As movie theaters grew in number and importance.a violinist would be added to the pianist in certain cases,and in the larger movie theaters small orchestras were formed.For a number of years the selection of music for each film program rested entirely in the hands of the conductor or leader of the orchestra,and very often the qualification for holding such a position was not skill or taste so much as the ownership of a large personal library of musical pieces.Since the conductor seldom saw the films until the night before they were to be shown (if indeed,the conductor was lucky enough to see them then),the musical arrangement was normally improvised   in the greatest hurry. To help meet this difficulty,film distributing companies started the practice of publishing suggestions for musical accompaniments.In 1909,for example,the Edison Company began issuing with their films such suggestions of mood as \"pleasant\",\"sad\",\"lively\".The suggestions became clearer,and so appeared the musical sheet containing indications of mood,the titles of suitable pieces of music,and precise directions to show where one piece led into the next.

At first,the music played bore no special relationship to the films;an accompaniment of any kind was sufficient.Within a very short time, however the _ of playing lively music to a serious film became apparent,and film pianists began to take some care in matching their pieces to the mood of the film. As movie theaters grew in number and importance.a violinist would be added to the pianist in certain cases,and in the larger movie theaters small orchestras were formed.For a number of years the selection of music for each film program rested entirely in the hands of the conductor or leader of the orchestra,and very often the qualification for holding such a position was not skill or taste so much as the ownership of a large personal library of musical pieces.Since the conductor seldom saw the films until the night before they were to be shown (if indeed,the conductor was lucky enough to see them then),the musical arrangement was normally improvised   in the greatest hurry. To help meet this difficulty,film distributing companies started the practice of publishing suggestions for musical accompaniments.In 1909,for example,the Edison Company began issuing with their films such suggestions of mood as \"pleasant\",\"sad\",\"lively\".The suggestions became clearer,and so appeared the musical sheet containing indications of mood,the titles of suitable pieces of music,and precise directions to show where one piece led into the next. Certain films had music especially composed for them.The most famous of these early special scores was that composed and arranged for D.W Griffith's film Birth of a Nation.which was shown in 1915.

The display is part of the second annual \"Happy Chinese New Year: Fantastic Art China\" festival held in New York on February 5-10, 2016. The China Central Academy of Fine Arts (CAFA), the U.S.-China Cultural Institute and the Cultural Associate of the Committee of 100 announced this year's events on November 18 at a press conference at the Lincoln Center. The \"Fantastic Art China\" festival will feature a larger and more diverse series of artistic and cultural events across New York's top cultural venues   and landmarks, including the Lincoln Center, Empire State Building and Jacob K. Javits Convention Center. This year's theme focuses on exploring the complicated relationship between sound and image, said Professor Yu Ding from CAFA, who is also president of Fantastic Art China and in charge of the festival's design. Lunar New Year, which celebrates the \"Year of the Monkey\" in 2016, is an opportunity to bring China's modern art to mainstream America, and the festival serves as  an innovative approach to establishing cultural exchange between China and New York City, Yu said. UNESCO Goodwill Ambassador Tan Dun's music is a new edition that will be featured  at several venues, including a major art exhibition at the Javits Center, events at the Lincoln Center and the fireworks display on the Hudson, which will take place on the evening of February 6. Five barges   on the river will launch the fireworks designed by CAFA that will tell a story about celebration and conservation. \"We Chinese are fond of nature, so the best way to celebrate the Lunar New Year is to salute with the sounds of nature, such as sounds of water, stone and bamboo,\" said Tan Dun at the press conference, \"And it will be fun to use the music of water during the firework display.\" In addition to the fireworks, a special lighting show at the Empire State Building will _ New York City during the holiday. Chinese New Year is being recognized as a public school holiday for the first time in New York. Children from the National Dance Institute, which represents 75 schools, will perform traditional Chinese dances at the Lincoln Center and the Javits Center.

Then the first sad thing happened. My mother became very ill, and soon she knew that she was dying. Just before she died, she asked Elizabeth and me to go to her room. She held our hands and said, \"Victor and Elizabeth, my children, I'm very happy because you love each other, and because one day you'll get married. Everyone in the family loves you, Elizabeth. Will you take my place in the family, my dear? I can die happy if you look after them when I have gone.\" My mother died and we were very sad, because we loved her dearly. Elizabeth was brave and helped us; her sweet smile gave us some happiness in the unhappy days after my mother's death. The time came for me to go to university. I didn't want to leave my sad family, but we all knew that I should go. It was hard to leave, too, because the parents of my good friend Henry would not let him go to university with me. So I had gone alone. On my first day at university I met my teacher, Professor Waldman, who was one of the greatest scientists in the world. He gave a wonderful talk to all the students who were starting at the university. He ended his talk by saying, \"Some of you will become the greatest scientists of tomorrow. You must study hard and discover everything that you can. This is why God made you intelligent--to help other people.\" After the professor's talk, I thought very carefully. I remembered the storm when I was 15; I remembered how the lightning had destroyed the tree. From then on, I wanted to use electricity to help people, and I wanted to discover the secrets of life. I decided to work on these two things. I started to work the next day. I worked very hard and soon Professor Waldman and I realized that I could learn to be a very good scientist. The professor helped me very much, and other important scientists who were his friends helped me, too.

How does life begin? Is it possible to put life into dead things? To answer these questions about life I had to learn first about death. I had to watch bodies from the moment when they died and the warm life left them. In the hospital and in the university, I watched the dying and the dead. Day after day, month after month, I followed death, so it was a dark and terrible time. I built a tall mast about 150 meters high, which is higher than the tallest building in the city, to catch lightning and send the electricity down to my machine in the lab.

Now, with more than 420,000 youngsters in the UK starting their new college school year, what is their first day like? BBC's Sean Coughlan described it in a recent report. According to Coughlan, at the very beginning it is not hard to spot something familiar to Chinese-a stream of parents arriving with their sons and daughters at the student village. Mothers, fathers and a teenager-now most likely taller than they are - stand together like the three might have done on the first day of primary school. \"The approach road to the student village is a long traffic jam of family cars, stuffed full with boxes, pillows and nervous families,\" he writes. \"The door closes on a student's room and parents and children go their separate ways. For many families, if childhood has a final moment, this is it.\" But saying goodbye to parents is not the only similarity between college freshmen in the UK and China. In both cases, new arrivals most want to know about their Internet connections. \"It's their most urgent concern,\" notes Coughlan. Even on their first day, university in the UK won't be an entirely lonely experience for some new students. \"Before they arrive they have been using social networking to get to know their future roommates,\" writes Coughlan. Still, the first night is something no UK university student ever forgets. There are people they meet and then spend three years avoiding and people who become their friends for the rest of their lives. First week stories are all about over-partying, bad cooking and misguided clothing, Coughlan says. As he concludes: \"These new students are entering their own soap opera of romance, friendship and ambition. It's a huge adventure that they've worked for years to achieve.\" From the article, we can conclude that Sean Coughlan's report is    _   .", "subject": ""}

Just 20 minutes of the following activities per day will give your students the finger strength and keyboard knowledge they need to be ready to include typing in their learning programs. Step 1 Knitting  : You can try various styles until you find the one that best suits your students' abilities. Finger knitting is a great way to start! It helps students focus on finger strength. Knitting with needles is a little more challenging but will suit some older    students. The more practice the fingers get the stronger they will become. Step 2 Key board games: It helps your students become familiar with the keyboard. Students as young as four years old can practice finger placement, letter sounds and names using the keyboard of computers. Step 3 Clay modeling: Many children develop the ability to be quick and skilful with their hands through creating clay models. The creative nature of this activity keeps children engaged for long periods of time. It helps keep fingers strong and supple. Step 4 Lego   building: Little fingers become strong when children pull apart little Lego time and time again. Because of the fun nature of this activity it helps build and does a lot to reinforce the ability to arrange things into an order -- another important aspect in typing.

Despite one of history's most extensive search efforts, involving more than 300 planes and dozens of ships, the Navy found nothing, not even an oil stain floating on the water. This is just one of the many frightening stories told of \"the Bermuda Triangle\", a mysterious area of the Atlantic Ocean roughly stretching southwest from Bermuda to the Florida coast and down to Puerto Rico. During the past 30 years, the triangle has claimed the lives of some 1,000 sailors and pilots. Stranger yet are the numerous \"ghost\" ships that have been found floating crewless within the triangle.

The captain of theEllen Austininstalled a new crew to sail it, but two days later, during a rough storm, the two ships temporarily lost sight of each other.

So, I just looked at her with a questioning expression on my face. But she didn't give up. She called my father into the room and asked him to explain to me what she meant. When my father was explaining I looked at her and wondered why she wanted to hug me. She then told me it was because she loved me and opened her arms wide. Shyly I opened mine and we hugged. That was my very first hug and I was 11 at that time. I'm 23 now and, thankfully, I have received many hugs since then. I consider her my birth mother because life began when I came to stay with her.

These men were lawyers, and they were going to the next town to attend court.  There had been a rain, and the ground was very soft. Water was dripping from the trees, and the grass was wet. The four lawyers rode along, one behind another, for the pathway was narrow, and the mud on each side of it was deep. They rode slowly, and talked and laughed and were very cheerful. As they were passing through a group of small trees, they heard a great fluttering over their heads and a weak sound made by small birds in the grass by the roadside. \"Stith! Stith! Stith!\" came from the leafy branches above them. \"Cheep! cheep! cheep!\" came from the wet grass. \"What is the matter here?\" asked the first lawyer, whose name was Speed. \"Oh, it's only some old robins !\"said the second lawyer, whose name was Hardin. \"The storm has blown two of the little ones out of the nest. They are too young to fly, and the mother bird is worried about them.\" \"What a pity! They'll die down there in the grass,\" said the third lawyer. \"Oh, well! They're nothing but birds,\" said Mr. Hardin. \"Why should we bother?\" \"Yes, why should we?\" said Mr. Speed. The three men, as they passed, looked down and saw the little birds fluttering in the cold, wet grass. They saw the mother robin flying about, and crying to her mate. Then they rode on, talking and laughing as before. In a few minutes they had forgotten about the birds. But the fourth lawyer, whose name was Abraham Lincoln, stopped. He got down from his horse and very gently took the little ones up in his big warm hands. They did not seem frightened, but cried softly, as if they knew they were safe. \"Never mind, my little fellows,\" said Mr. Lincoln \"I will put you in your own cozy little bed.\" Then he looked up to find the nest from which they had fallen. It was high, much higher than he could reach. But Mr. Lincoln could climb. He had climbed many a tree when he was a boy. He put the birds softly, one by one, into their warm little home. Two other baby birds were there that had not fallen out. All cuddled down together and were very happy. Soon the three lawyers who had ridden ahead stopped at a spring to give their horses water. \"Where is Lincoln?\" asked one. All were surprised to find that he was not with them. \"Do you remember those birds?\" said Mr. Speed. \"Very likely he has stopped to take care of them.\" In a few minutes Mr. Lincoln joined them. His shoes were covered with mud; he had torn his coat on the thorny tree. \"Hello, Abraham!\" said Mr. Hardin. \"Where have you been?\" \"I stopped a minute to give those birds to their mother,\" he answered. \"Well, we always thought you were a hero,\" said Mr. Speed. \"Now we know it.\" Then all three of them laughed heartily. They thought it so foolish that a strong man should take so much trouble just for some worthless young birds. \"Gentlemen,\" said Mr. Lincoln, \"I could not have slept tonight, if I had left those helpless little robins to die in the wet grass.\" Abraham Lincoln afterwards became very famous as a lawyer and statesman.

But while other words used in the same context, such as \"sorry\" or \"what\", vary widely across languages, \"huh?\" remains unchanged. The Dutch researchers carefully studied ten languages from around the world, including Siwu, which is spoken in Ghana, and an Australian Aboriginal language, as well as Italian, Spanish, Dutch and Mandarin Chinese. They analysed tapes of recorded conversations for words that sounded like \"huh?\" and were used to request that whatever had just been said be repeated. All contained a version of \"huh?\". The word was also found in another 21 languages. While there were subtle differences in each country, all sounded basically the same. This is surprising because normally unrelated languages will use very different words to describe the same thing. For instance, the Japanese for \"dog\" is \"inu\", while the French is \"chien\".

The period between 1890 and 1920 is known as the \"golden age\" of print media. Broadcast radio came onto the media scene in the 1920's. Newspapers were forced to re-evaluate   their role as society's primary information provider. Like the new media technologies of today, the development of a low-cost, convenient media source produced results that radio would greatly affect the newspaper industry.  No sooner had newspapers adapted to radio than they were forced to re-evaluate themselves because of a new and more powerful medium: television. Between 1940 and 1990, newspaper sales in America dropped from one newspaper for every two adults to one for every three adults. Some newspapers, like USA Today, responded to the technological advancements by using color1 and the \"short, quick and to the point\" stories that are usually featured on television. The technological revolution of today is creating new challenges and opportunities for traditional media. Never before has so much information been so accessible   to so many. By the end of the 1990s, about 700 traditional media had websites; today there are thousands.

Luckily, he survived. But something inside him had died. His enthusiasm for life was gone. He refused to follow doctor's orders, and his sour attitude made everyone upset when they visit him. Dad was left alone. So I asked Dad to come to live with me on my small farm, hoping the fresh air would help him adjust. Within a week after he moved in, I regretted the invitation. He criticized everything I did. I became frustrated. Something had to be done. One day I read an article which said when given dogs, depressed patients would be better off. So I drove to the animal shelter that afternoon. As soon as I got there, a pointer's eyes caught my attention. They watched me calmly.

I drove home with the dog on the front seat beside me. I was helping it out of the car when Dad walked onto the front porch. \"Look what I got you!\" I said excitedly. Dad wrinkled his face. \"I don't want it,\" he muttered, turning back towards the house. Then, suddenly, the dog pulled free from my grasp. He sat down in front of my Dad. Dad's anger melted, and soon he was hugging the dog. This was the beginning of a warm friendship. Dad named the dog Cheyenne.

As a day-to-day essential, it will die off with the generation who read print newspapers. The kind of shopping, where you hand over notes and count out change in return, now happens only in the most minor of our retailers  , like buying a bar of chocolate or a pint of milk from a corner shop. At the shops where you spend any real money, that money is increasingly abstracted. And this is more and more true, the higher up the scale you go. At the most cutting-edge   retail stores, Victoria Beckham on Dover Street, for instance, you don't go and stand at any kind of cash register when you decide to pay. The staff are equipped with iPads to take your payment while you relax on a sofa. Across society, the abstraction of the idea of cash makes me uneasy. Maybe I'm just old-fashioned. But earning money isn't quick or easy for most of us. Isn't it a bit weird  that spending it should happen in half a blink   of an eye? Doesn't a wallet, that time-honored Friday-night feeling of pleasing, promising fatness, represent something that matters? But I'll leave the economics to the experts. What bothers me about the death of the wallet is the change it represents in our physical environment.

{"answer": 0, "choices": ["Electronically.", "In the abstract.", "Individually.", "Via a cash register."], "question": "The wallet is heading for extinction. As a day-to-day essential, it will die off with the generation who read print newspapers. The kind of shopping, where you hand over notes and count out change in return, now happens only in the most minor of our retailers  , like buying a bar of chocolate or a pint of milk from a corner shop. At the shops where you spend any real money, that money is increasingly abstracted. And this is more and more true, the higher up the scale you go. At the most cutting-edge   retail stores, Victoria Beckham on Dover Street, for instance, you don't go and stand at any kind of cash register when you decide to pay. The staff are equipped with iPads to take your payment while you relax on a sofa. Across society, the abstraction of the idea of cash makes me uneasy. Maybe I'm just old-fashioned. But earning money isn't quick or easy for most of us. Isn't it a bit weird  that spending it should happen in half a blink   of an eye? Doesn't a wallet, that time-honored Friday-night feeling of pleasing, promising fatness, represent something that matters? But I'll leave the economics to the experts.

But did you ever wonder how and why this happens? To answer the question, first you have to understand what leaves are and what they do. Leaves are nature's food factories. Plants take water from the ground through their roots. And they take a gas called carbon dioxide from the air. Plants use sunlight to turn water and carbon dioxide into glucose  . Glucose is a kind of sugar. Plants use glucose as food for energy and as a building block for growing. The way plants turn water and carbon dioxide into sugar is called photosynthesis  . That means, \"putting together with light\". A chemical called chlorophyll   helps photosynthesis. Chlorophyll is what gives plants their green color1. As summer ends and autumn comes, the days get shorter and shorter. This is how trees \"know\" to begin getting ready for winter. During winter, there is not enough light or water for photosynthesis. Trees rest during this time and live off the food they stored during the summer. They begin to shut down their food-making factories. The green chlorophyll disappears from the leaves. As the bright green fades away, we begin to see yellow and orange leaves. Small amounts of these color1s have been in the leaves all along. We just can't see them in the summer, because they are covered up by the green chlorophyll. The bright reds and yellows we see in leaves are made mostly in autumn. In some trees, like maples, glucose is caught in the leaves after photosynthesis stops. Sunlight and the cool nights of autumn turn this glucose into a red color1.

They never said it was impossible for me to achieve what I have.\" In her short but successful career, Amelia has tried different styles. But vampires were the first characters to really come alive in her work. From _ she has developed a whole world, one which she always enjoys learning more about. As a published teen writer, Amelia's advice to other teens who dream of being authors is: just do it! \"I believe anything is possible. Don't give up your dreams just because you fear failure. Getting a book published is difficult, but if I can do it, others can too. \" Which of the following can be the best title for the text?", "subject": ""}

That means it's a slow time for jewelers, and a good time for you to make a purchase. Whether you're out shopping for gold, or silver, here fife a few things you need to know: What determines price? The purity of the metal is one of the elements that determines the price. Gold purity is indicated with a stamp of 10K, 14K, 18K, or 24K. And different countries have their own standards. For example, for a piece to be considered gold in the US, it must be at least 10K. In Britain and Canada: 9K. In Italy and France: l 8K. Anything over l 8K is really too soft for everyday wear. That's why jewelry stores in the US sell mostly 14K. How much can you expect to pay? That depends on the weight of the metal and the gemstone . So keep that in mind, especially when buying online.

So much so that retailers are now offering fine gemstones with silver--something you used to see only with gold. Keep in mind that in the US. the sterling silver standard is 92.5% real silver.

At first, he was no one special in my life. Then he became my friend. In time, I felt he was also my father. Leo married my mother when I was eleven. Two years later we moved into a house in a new suburban development, where we put down roots. At first our lawn was just a mud with wild grass, but Leo saw bright possibilities. \"We'll plant trees there to give us shade as well as some flowers,\" he said. And just these little touches made our house different from all the others. More important, a real family was forming. Leo was becoming a full-time parent, and I was learning what it meant to have a father. Weekday mornings when the weather was bad, Leo often drove me to school. Having a father drop you off may have been something my classmates took for granted, but I always thought it was wonderful. Saturday mornings, we went to the hardware shop, then stepped into the five-and-ten, buying a sports magazine or something else. Some people might think that doing shopping together is nothing special, but I, who had ever before spent my childhood watching other families do their everyday activities, experienced them now with extreme delight.

To me, this happened and was only two feet away from me. Locating my friend among the passengers, I noticed a man coming toward me carrying two light bags. He stopped right next to me to greet his family. First he walked to his youngest son (maybe 6 years old) as he laid down his bags. They gave each other a long, loving hug. As they separated enough to look in each other's face, I heard the father say,\"It's so good to see you, son.

I love you very much, Zach!\" They too hugged a most loving, tender hug. While this was happening, a baby girl (perhaps one or oneandahalfyear old) was squirming   excitedly in her mother's arms, never once taking her little eyes off the wonderful sight of her returning father. The man said,\"Hi, baby girl!\" as he gently took the child from her mother. He quickly kissed her face all over and then held her close to his chest while rocking her from side to side. The little girl instantly relaxed and simply laid her head on his shoulder, motionless in pure contentment.

He looked me straight in the eye, and with forcefulness that burned right into my soul, he told me something that left me a different person, \"Don't hope, friend... decide!\" Then he flashed me his wonderful smile again, shook my hand and said,\"God bless!\" With that, he and his family turned and walked away together.

He stopped right next to me to greet his family. First he walked to his youngest son (maybe 6 years old) as he laid down his bags. They gave each other a long, loving hug. As they separated enough to look in each other's face, I heard the father say,\"It's so good to see you, son.

Airline pilots can also use it to reduce the 30% of all pilot-error accidents that are related to fatigue. Driver Alert is based on a computerized wristband. The device, worn by drivers or pilots, gives out a sound about every four minutes during a car journey. After each sound the driver must respond by squeezing the steering wheel. A sensor in the wristband detects this pressing action and measures the time between the sound the driver's response. Tiredness is directly related to a driver's response time. Usually, a watchful driver would take about 400 milliseconds to respond, but once that falls to more than 500 milliseconds, it suggests that the driver is getting sleepy. In such cases the device gives out more regular and louder sounds, showing that the driver should open a window or stop for a rest. If the driver's response continues to slow down, the sounds become more frequent until a nonstop alarm warns that the driver must stop as soon as possible.

The good news is that the rate of increase has slowed. The bad news is that prices will not go down anytime soon. Also,the rate of global agricultural production is slowing.

FAO DirectorGeneral Jose Graziano da Silva spoke at a news conference in Rome when the report was released.

In middleincome countries, people are gaining weight as they eat fewer fruits and vegetables and more of the cheaper but less nutritious foods. The report also shows that farmers in poorer countries will be leading efforts to feed an expected 9,000,000,000 people by 2050.The outlook predicts that farmers in Latin America,the Caribbean and subSaharan Africa will drive agricultural production in the future.

For Web designer Patrick Moberg, then 21, from Brooklyn, it was love at first sight when he saw a woman on a Manthttan train last November. But he lost her in the crowd so he set up a website with a sketch picture to find her--www.Nygirlofmydreams.com. Unbelievably in a city of 8 million people, it only took Moberg 48 hours to find the woman, with his phone ringing non-stop and email box overflowing.

Visit any park between Memorial Day (end of May) and Labor Day (beginning of September) and you'll find families and groups of friends enjoying the warm weather and sharing a meal. Birthday celebrations, family reunions, sporting events and holidays are all common reasons to host a get-together. But just wanting to be outside on a nice summer day is the best reason! Food is an important part of any gathering, and in the summer Americans love to cook outside on grills . All kinds of meats, such as hamburgers, hot dogs, chicken and sausages, and even vegetables like corn, peppers or potatoes can be cooked on the grill. Many typical families have grills in their yards, and many parks also have grills for public use. Men seem to particularly like to do the job of barbecuing the food, even if they don't usually cook at any other time. Many have \"secret recipes\" for a delicious barbecue sauce . Other guests at the party will often be asked to \" bring a dish to share\". This means that they will make some kind of side dish (a salad or vegetable) or dessert, and share it with the others. If you make something very delicious, people may want you to make it every time! Fried chicken and sandwiches are popular at picnics too, because you eat them with your hands. Potato salads and baked beans are favorite side dishes. Which of the following statements is True?", "subject": ""}

But unlike human, plants can have their temperature taken from 3,000 feet away--straight up. A decade ago, adopting the infrared scanning technology developed for military purposes and other satellites, physicist Stephen Paley came up with a quick way to take the temperature of crops to determine which ones are under stress. The goal was to let farmers precisely target pesticide spraying rather than rain poison on a whole field, which invariably includes plants that don't have pest problems. Even better, Paley's Remote Scanning Services Company could detect crop problems before they became visible to the eye. Mounted on a plane flown at 3,000 feet at night, an infrared scanner measured the heat emitted by crops. The data were transformed into a colourcoded map showing where plants were running \"fevers\".

{"answer": 1, "choices": ["To show how students can find a part-time job.", "To discuss the issue of students' part-time work.", "To stress the importance of students' part-time work.", "To explain what is a part-time job."], "question": "For some students, especially those from poor families, taking a job is not a matter of choice, but necessity. They need to work to save for college, or even to supplement family income. Counselors should help students who have a real need to work improve time management skills and seek employment that helps their educational goals. \"College costs are high, and young adults also want the amenities   that extra money brings,\" according to John B. Boshoven, counselor for continuing education at Community High School in Michigan. However, he warns, \"School is my students' full-time job.\" Studies show that students who work are more confident and possess better time management skills than students who are not employed. In addition to offering a paycheck, some independence, and satisfaction, a part-time job can provide teenagers with both training and experience. Working teaches students about responsibility and can also reinforce   what they are learning in school. \"Colleges want to find candidates who demonstrate maturity, responsibility, independence, and initiative, and good workers certainly demonstrate those important character traits,\" Boshoven says. \"Employers can write excellent recommendation letters for the students who have worked for them.\" On the other hand, experts agree that students who work more than 15 to 20 hours per week often experience lessened school success, which can lead to dropping out entirely.

New experiments show that may not be true, even within a vacuum. Sometimes, light slows a bit. The new research is\"very impressive work\", Robert Boyd toldScienceNews.An optical physicist at the University of Rochester in New York, he did not work on the study. He speaks of the new finding:\"It's the sort of thing that's so obvious; you wonder why you didn't think of it first.\" Light travels as particles and as waves. Photons are the name given to those particles that represent the smallest possible amount of light. At their fastest, photons travel nearly 300 million meters (almost 1 billion feet) in a single second. That's fast enough to get to the moon and back in about 2.6 seconds. Scientists had long known, though, that they could slow light photons down by shining them through a material such as glass or water. Still, light moving through a vacuum has usually been assumed to move at a peak speed. That would seem to make sense. After all, a vacuum is a space with nothing in it to slow light down. In a new study, however, scientists show that even racing through a vacuum, light can slow. So the speed of light is more of a universal speed limit than an   rule for how fast photons travel, the new data suggest. Miles Padgett led the new study. As an optical physicist, he works at the University of Glasgow in Scotland. He and his colleagues showed that the key to slowing light is to change the shape of a light wave. Padgett described how they did this in a paper published online January 22 inScience. His team raced a pair of photons. One traveled unchanged through a cable made from optical fibers. The other passed through a pair of devices that acted like lenses. A lens changes light: It can focus a spread-out beam of light on a point, for instance. The second photon passed through one device that changed the shape of its waveand another that changed it back to its original form. The first photon won the race. The second photon came in a tiny bit later, several quadrillionths  of a second late for every meter of the race. The difference wasn't huge, but it was enough to measure. Most technology would not pick up such a small change, but it could be important to scientists who study short pulses of light. \"I'm not surprised the effect exists,\"Boyd toldScienceNews.\"But it's surprising that the effect is so large and strong.\" What does the study led by Miles Padgett mainly suggest?", "subject": ""}

The storm had not washed this away, but there was no footpath across it. She would have to cross it by stepping from sleeper   to sleeper. With great care she began the dangerous crossing, sometimes on her hands and knees, hardly daring to look down between the sleepers into the wild flood waters below. If she should slip, she would fall between the sleepers, into the rapidly flowing stream. At last -- she never knew how long it had taken her -- she felt solid ground under her feet. But there was no time to rest. She still had to run more than half a mile and had only a few minutes left. Unless she reached the station before the express did, many, many lives would be lost.

In some rare cases it might be right to follow  the crowd, but in most cases this' can be a big mistake.  Actually there are reasons why we shouldn't follow the crowd blindly. According to a study, people often follow the crowd when they aren't sure about the direction they should take. This means a large number of people could be following others without understanding what's right and what's wrong! This makes more people follow and as a result most people move in a certain direction even if it isn't right. A man who wants to be successful always hopes for others' guidance and he usually follows the same path of most people, but the question this man never asks himself is: are all of those people successful ?Of course not! If you want to follow a crowd, then follow a successful one. However,  in real life you'll only find one successful person among hundreds of people ,  and that's why following the crowd makes no sense at all Most people act emotionally without thinking wisely. If you always follow others because they're greater than you in number, then sooner or later you'll discover that you're taking emo- tional decisions you might regret later.

Frequently hearing the phrase \"thank you\" or \"well done\" means the same to staff as a modest pay rise, researchers say.

A third of 1,000 workers surveyed by the famous firm White Water Strategies said they did not get thanked at all when they did well----and a further third said they were not thanked enough, meaning they were less likely to put themselves into work and were more likely to look for employment elsewhere. The final result is around PS5.2 billion in lost productivity from employees who would raise their interests in work if they felt more appreciated, White Water claimed. According to the company, praising staff has the same motivational kick as a 1 per cent pay rise - and works out much cheaper for bosses.

Hopefully, this Mothering Sunday you will get to hear those three words. I will, of course, try to phone you. I hope we will be able to speak for the allowed 10 minutes. But I suspect many inmates will be using the phone, so if I don't call and if we don't speak, then this is what I would have said: It's not your fault that I am here. I know that deep in your heart you have questioned whether my current circumstance is somehow your fault, if the reckless stupidity of my past is somehow a failure on your part. It is not. Only one person is to blame, only one person should hurt -- me. You have always taught me that when the room goes dark, you can wait for the lights to be switched back on or you can search in the dark and turn the light on yourself. You are my light. You always have been and always will be. There is nobody I admire more, nobody I have strived harder to please in my life, which is why my current failure hurts me so much. I am so sorry that I will not be there to see you, but I want you to know that now, as always, you are here with me. In my darkest hours, and in the coldest loneliness of my past few months, my mind has so often wandered to the past, to when it was you and me -- and I have been able to smile. Yours is the strength that I draw upon. A parent's job is to make sure that they pass on the best of themselves to their children. You have done that. It is the inner you in me that will get me through _ . I have failed you so epically, but you have never failed me. If I think back to the tears I shed when Dad left, all those years ago, I see you through their misty glaze. You holding me and you telling me we'd be OK, and we will be. We are and always will be the best team. Childhood heroes such as footballers, actors and rock stars are _ . If the job's done right, a child's heroes should be their parents -- you are mine. The strength you showed after the divorce from Dad to find your biological parents, to go to university and get your teaching qualifications, to begin your life again, is the strength that I draw on now. It is the belief in myself, it is the belief you have in me, that tells me that once I am released I can and will rebuild my life. I will make you proud again. I will make you happy to have me as your son. Yours is the will that gets me through every day. I don't believe you can judge a person for the mistakes they make, as we all make them, but you can judge them for what they do afterwards. And after this, when it is all over, you will still have a son with the same hopes and dreams. They have not diminished. If you can dream it, then you have to believe it can happen -- right? So this Mothering Sunday, please think back to that morning in the 80s, the first Mother's Day without Dad, when a six-year-old me got up early and made breakfast for you. Do you remember it? Could you ever forget? A slice of bread a doorstep thick and a wedge of cheese equally dense. You didn't have to eat it, but you did, chewing every dry mouthful. I know now why you forced yourself -- because it had been made with love. Well, things don't change this year -- this letter is that bread and cheese (it sure has plenty of the cheese!). I love you so much. I am sorry I have let you down, but you have taught me that we will always pick ourselves up and become better than we were before.

You have always taught me that when the room goes dark, you can wait for the lights to be switched back on or you can search in the dark and turn the light on yourself. You are my light. You always have been and always will be. There is nobody I admire more, nobody I have strived harder to please in my life, which is why my current failure hurts me so much. I am so sorry that I will not be there to see you, but I want you to know that now, as always, you are here with me. In my darkest hours, and in the coldest loneliness of my past few months, my mind has so often wandered to the past, to when it was you and me -- and I have been able to smile. Yours is the strength that I draw upon. A parent's job is to make sure that they pass on the best of themselves to their children. You have done that. It is the inner you in me that will get me through _ . I have failed you so epically, but you have never failed me. If I think back to the tears I shed when Dad left, all those years ago, I see you through their misty glaze. You holding me and you telling me we'd be OK, and we will be. We are and always will be the best team. Childhood heroes such as footballers, actors and rock stars are _ . If the job's done right, a child's heroes should be their parents -- you are mine. The strength you showed after the divorce from Dad to find your biological parents, to go to university and get your teaching qualifications, to begin your life again, is the strength that I draw on now. It is the belief in myself, it is the belief you have in me, that tells me that once I am released I can and will rebuild my life. I will make you proud again. I will make you happy to have me as your son. Yours is the will that gets me through every day. I don't believe you can judge a person for the mistakes they make, as we all make them, but you can judge them for what they do afterwards. And after this, when it is all over, you will still have a son with the same hopes and dreams. They have not diminished. If you can dream it, then you have to believe it can happen -- right? So this Mothering Sunday, please think back to that morning in the 80s, the first Mother's Day without Dad, when a six-year-old me got up early and made breakfast for you. Do you remember it? Could you ever forget? A slice of bread a doorstep thick and a wedge of cheese equally dense. You didn't have to eat it, but you did, chewing every dry mouthful. I know now why you forced yourself -- because it had been made with love. Well, things don't change this year -- this letter is that bread and cheese (it sure has plenty of the cheese!). I love you so much. I am sorry I have let you down, but you have taught me that we will always pick ourselves up and become better than we were before.

While your baby still might not be able to speak, he or she knows about you're feeling down. Babies as young as 5 months of age can distinguish an exciting tune from a sad one, according to a study published in 2014 in the journalNeuron. Speaking of music, it seems that babies can't resist it. Not only are their ears sensitive to the beats, babies can actually dance in time to them, according to a study published in 2010. To test their dancing ability, the researchers played recordings of classical music and speech to them, and videotaped the results. The babies moved their arms, hands, legs, feet, and heads much more in response to the music than to speech. The findings suggest this dancing ability is innate  in humans. Babies can apparently learn even while asleep. As newborn babies spend most of their time sleeping, this newfound ability might be crucial  for them to adapt rapidly to the world around them, and help ensure survival, the researchers say. The study was published in the journalProceedings of the National Academy of Sciences.

Passion results in creation.In nine years,I had accumulated more pieces than I could count.My finished paintings were set aside,gathering dust as time passed.So I decided to hold exhibitions to find a home and some appreciation for my artwork. Nonetheless,I was extremely nervous.After all,I am only a l5-year-old child who has a passion,but not necessarily one who creates artwork that others want to buy. However,the turnout was more than I could ever have imagined,and the amount of money we raised quadrupled our original target.We were very lucky to find a charity,Stepping Stone,that would show us exactly how our money would be used:to teach English to poor children in the country.I was even offered an opportunity to teach the children myself. Through this experience,I not only gained more confidence in my art,but also discovered its impact.I realized a paintbrush could paint not only a canvas,but also new opportunities for others who don't have as many choices in who they want to be,or what they want to do.Although this cannot transform the world,this may transform the world for one child,or even more.

Find out what causes tsunamis and read about some recent examples of tsunamis that have occurred around the globe.               The Japanese word for tsunami means harbor wave. Tsunamis are sometimes called tidal   waves but this term has fallen out of favour because tsunamis are not related to tides. Tsunamis are huge waves of water that are usually caused by earthquakes or volcanic eruptions.               As a tsunami approaches the shore, water may move back from the coast. If it is shallow enough the water may be pulled back hundreds of metres. If you are in the area, you can know that a tsunami is on the way when you see this phenomenon.               Regions in tsunami danger zones often have warning systems in place to give people as much time as possible to move to a safe place.               When tsunamis hit shallow water (often near the coast) they slow down but increase in height.               An earthquake in the Indian Ocean off Indonesia in December 2004 caused a tsunami that killed over 200,000 people in 14 countries.

In a nation with such a strict work ethic  , this is considered strange. Working only 40 hours a week? I just don't know many people who punch out   at five o'clock anymore. My father tried to teach me the importance of hard work, long hours and devotion to a career. But then there are the things he taught me unintentionally, like when he arrived home from work for the last time and crawled up the stairs. My father, a self-employed sales trainer, was that sick, that tired. His body was wracked with liver cancer, and he suffered the effects of a diabetic ulcer . Despite all this, he insisted on traveling a long way to give a lecture. He probably earned a lot of money that day, but he paid the price. He returned to the hospital soon afterwards and was dead within three months, aged just 58. It's been 10 years since I saw my father come home that night and since then, I've thought a lot about work. I've decided something: I will never crawl up the stairs exhausted. As much as I love my job as a newspaper reporter, I will never work myself into the ground, physically or emotionally. _ After all, I am my father's daughter. In college, I was the girl who sat on the library steps each morning, waiting for the doors to open. I even dreamt about schoolwork. My dad once told me he was unable to just gaze at a sunset; he had to be doing something as he looked at it--writing, reading, playing chess. You could say he was a success: He was a published author, an accomplished musician, fluent in many languages. That's an impressive list, but the thing is I want to gaze at sunsets. I don't want to meet a deadline during them or be writing a column at the same time, or glance at them over the top of a book. This raises the question: If I leave work at five o' clock to watch the sunset, what are the consequences? Do I risk not reaching the top of my profession? Maybe, because honestly, knocking off after eight hours probably won't earn me the best promotion. But hey, leaving work at five o' clock means I eat dinner with my family. I get to hop on my bike and cycle through the streets of my hometown when there is no traffic. And I get to take in a lot of sunsets. That's got to be worth something.

{"answer": 1, "choices": ["Doubtful.", "Supportive.", "Worried.", "Changing."], "question": "About ten days ago, I started to write an article on a parenting subject. I wish I could publish  it. But in the days between the writing and the publishing, an unfortunate thing happened. My article discussing the lost art of walking to school was finished three days before an 8-year-old boy named Leiby Kletzky in Brooklyn tried to walk home for the first time from his summer camp.     Today I will not describe the details around the Leiby Kletzky killing, except to point out the obvious fact that it terrified every parent who heard about it. What happened this week is one of the biggest reasons why so few kids walk to school now.    In theory, walking to school is a wonderful habit, which can teach children independence, introduce them to their neighborhoods and encourage physical activity. It's better for the environment, eases traffic and is just generally the most fun choice.    However, many of us parents don't allow the habit, mentioning the problems of logistics and distance. What we talk about less often is our fear. Maybe that's the heart of the matter. Indeed, it is an understandable reaction. But it is not a necessary one. What happened this week is extremely rare.    Separating out the fact from the feelings is a difficult thing to do. Very few of us were ready to breathe easy about sending our young children off by themselves no matter what happened. We are far more worried now.    The good news is that we don't have to be. Those children who go to school by themselves can be escorted when the neighborhood forms a \"walking school bus\". That's when designated parents walk with groups of children from home to school. With the benefit of safety, it allows kids to enjoy one of the joys of childhood. It's an easy, affordable choice.    A walking school bus is a good idea that parents thought of. Proper measures are usually out there. Sometimes all they take is a little cooperation and some courage. What is the author's attitude towards walking school bus?", "subject": ""}

Though I felt bad for them, I did not want to interact with them. Then one rainy day, I met Colonel Hemsworth. He invited me to his table and asked for some company. I regarded this as another boring task. However, when I listened to his stories, I learned that he was a brilliant war veteran ,and I found his tales interesting. After my brief talk with the Colonel, I realized that I shared common characters with all the seniors. I felt like an oxygen molecule ---ready to form a relationship--rather than an isolated gas. I met with many learned senior citizens who shared their experiences and wisdom. No longer did I walk aimlessly down the hallways. I found myself enjoying talking with these people as I learned their histories. Why hadn't I realized sooner that volunteer work could enlighten me?

Oxygen inhalers I didn't realize oxygen inhalers also get a cut in the smog economy. As a matter of fact, your oxygen uptake has nothing to with relieving   the impact of smog. It might even lead to oxygen poisoning when you inhale too much oxygen. So don't get greedy. 4. Salt lamps Compared to oxygen inhalers, salt lamps are even worse. Some stores are selling the products at several hundred yuan, saying that they can release negative ions , reduce radiation levels and purify the air. The lamps mainly contain sodium chloride. The boiling point of sodium is about 800 degrees centigrade and that of candle is 500. So how on earth can negative ions be released at only 500 degrees? 5. Plants that absorb smog Yeah, right. Plants Vs Smog. It is scientifically justified   that some plants do absorb pollutants from the air. Money plants and calla lilies are among the best-sellers in the market. Even if they don't work, it's good to have some plants in the house anyway. How many ways does the author think are useful?", "subject": ""}

The waste costs PS 480 a year per household on average, and PS 680 per family.

{"answer": 1, "choices": ["Math and reading.", "Math and spelling.", "Reading and writing.", "Reading and thinking."], "question": "As summer comes near, many children are really happy to forget about school for a few months. However, they might be taking that goal too seriously. Studies have found that children often forget between one and three months' worth of school learning during the summer months. Spelling and math abilities drop off the most, while reading is not really influenced by the time off. The main reason for this is because most children sometimes read outside of the classroom, whether newspapers, magazines, books, or video game guides. However, their math and spelling skills only get exercised in the school setting. The first purpose of summer holidays was to let farm children have time off to help work in the fields during the growing season, but this reason is no longer a good one since fewer kids actually work on farms today. Some cities in the United States, such as Los Angeles, have moved to a year-round school timetable, which may help reduce the loss of school skills that happens during the long summer holiday. To improve skills and to keep a good level of preparation, headmasters suggest trips to museums, summer camps, holidays with educational value, and visits to libraries to keep kids interested throughout the summer. There are other educational systems that provide holidays while still keeping students' skills up to date. For example, in Japan, students attend class for seven weeks in a row, followed by two weeks of holiday. This continues the whole year. In Italy, students attend class six days per week, but finish at 1: 30 pm each day, so that school does not run their life the way that it does in America, where students attend high school from 7: 45 am until 3: 00 pm each weekday.

In the daytime I ran by her side and at night I lay down close by her. When it was hot, we used to stand by the pond in the shade of the trees and when it was cold, we had a nice warm wooden house. As soon as I was old enough to eat grass, my mother used to go out to work during the daytime and come back in the evening. There were six young colts  in the field besides me; they were older than I; some were nearly as large as grown-up horses. I used to run with them, and had great fun; we used to gallop  all together in the field. Sometimes we had rather play rough, for others would frequently bite, kick as well as gallop. One day, when there was a good deal of kicking, my mother came to me and said, \"I expect you to pay attention to what I am going to say. The colts who live here are very good colts, but they are cart horse colts, and of course they have not learned manners. You have been well-bred and well-born. I hope you will grow up gentle and good, and never learn bad ways. I hope you do your work with a good will, lift your feet up well when you move quickly, and never bite or kick.\" I have never forgotten my mother's advice. I knew she was a wise old horse, and our master thought a great deal of her. Her name was Duchess, but he often called her Pet. Our master gave us good food; he spoke as kindly to us as he did to his little children. We were all fond of him. When my mother saw him at the gate, she would neigh  with joy. He would pat and touch her and say, \"Well, Pet, how is your little Darkie?\" Then he would give me a piece of bread and sometimes he brought a carrot for my mother.  _  There was a plowboy, Dick, who sometimes came into our field to pick blackberries. When he had eaten all he wanted, he would throw stones and sticks at us. We did not much mind him, for we could gallop  off; but sometimes a stone would hurt us. One day he was at this game. Our master saw what was going on, so he jumped and caught Dick by the arm, giving him a box  on the ear. \"Bad boy!\" he said, \"this shall be the last time. Get away; I shall not want you on my farm again.\" So we never saw Dick any more. Old Daniel, the man who looked after the horses, was just as gentle as our master, so we were well off.

{"answer": 3, "choices": ["description of two similar objects in a poetic way", "literary device specially employed in poetry writing", "contrast between two different things to create a vivid image", "comparison between two different objects with similar features"], "question": "A metaphor is a poetic device that deals with comparison. It compares similar qualities of two dissimilar objects. With a simple metaphor, one object becomes the other: Love is a rose. Although this does not sound like a particularly rich image, a metaphor can communicate so much about a particular image that poets use them more than any other type of figurative language. The reason for this is that poets compose their poetry to express what they are experiencing emotionally at that moment. Consequently, what the poet imagines love to be may or may not be our understanding of love. Therefore, the poet's job is to enable us to experience it, to feel it the same way as the poet does. Let's analyze this remarkably simple metaphor concerning love and the rose to see what it offers. Because the poet uses a comparison with a rose, first we must examine the characteristics of that flower. A rose is impressive in its beauty, its petals are nicely soft, and its smell is pleasing. It's possible to say that a rose is actually a feast to the senses of sight, touch, and smell. The rose's appearance seems to border on perfection, each petal seemingly equal in form. Isn't this the way one's love should be?A loved one should be a delight to one's senses and seem perfect. However, there is another dimension added to the comparison by using a rose. Roses have thorns. The poet wants to convey the idea that roses can be tricky. So can love, the metaphor tells us.

New research from the Universities of Cambridge and Exeter reveals for the first time that, contrary to current models used to explain the movement of flocks, the differences between bird species and social relationships between individuals play a critical role in determining the dynamics of mixed-species flocks. The unified  behaviour of bird flocks has puzzled scientists for hundreds of years. One naturalist from the turn of the century even suggested telepathy may be involved. There have since been more logical explanations, including mathematical models that show that repeated interactions among individuals following simple rules can _ coordinated  group movements. However, these models usually rely on the assumption that individuals within groups are identical and interact independently, which may not reflect reality. Jolle Jolles, a PhD student at the University of Cambridge's Department of Zoology and author of the paper, said:\"Spectacular collective behaviour can be found in a large range of animal species, and we now know that often these complex coordinated group movements may be the result of individuals following simple rules. However, rarely are the individual characteristics and social relationships within them taken into account. Our research highlights that these striking displays of group behaviour are much more complex.\" By analysing high-resolution photographs of mixed flocks of rooks and jackdaws (both from the corvid family), the researchers found that rather than individuals interacting in a consistent fashion throughout the flock, interactions depended on social dynamics between the different species as well as relationships within a species. The researchers discovered that birds prefer to fly close to members of their own species, and that the larger and more dominant rooks take the lead by flying near the front of flocks. Additionally, the lifelong, monogamous pair bonds that are characteristic of both species seem to be reflected in flight, as birds often fly particularly close to a single, same-species partner. Dr Alex Thornton, principal investigator of the Cambridge Jackdaw Project, now at the University of Exeter and author of the paper, said: \"Together, our findings demonstrate that to understand the structure of groups -- such as bird flocks -- we need to consider the characteristics and relationships of the individuals within them.\" According to Jolle Jolles, what are seldom considered about coordinated group movement?", "subject": ""}

He told viewers that, for only $100, they could own the first 10 miles above all their property. You would be able to charge any commercial plane that flew over your property $100 per crossing. You would also be able to charge government rockets, satellites, space shuttles, and space stations $100 for each and every violation of your air rights.    Another time, Jones claimed to have invented a product that gets rid of calories. He showed the viewers a spray can of \"NoCal.\" He said that by simply spraying NoCal on your food, a chemical interaction would cause all the calories in the food to simply disappear within about 10 seconds. The NoCal was only $10 a can. As usual, Jones received thousands of checks in the mail.    The judge told Jones that he should be ashamed of himself. Jones responded that he was very ashamed of himself, and that when he got out of prison he hoped to become a TV adviser to help people avoid getting cheated. He told the judge that he was already developing an instructional CD that, for merely $100, would save people thousands of dollars in scams .

Were you the first or last child in your family? Or were you a middle or the only child? Some people think it matters where you were born in your family. But there are different ideas about what birth order means. Some people say that oldest children are smart and strong-willed. They are very likely to be successful. The reason for this is simple.

As we get older, we come to realize that those challenges are the very things that shape us and make us who we are. It is the same with the challenges that come with friendship.

Although there are certainly times when calling it quits is the right thing to do, in most cases all that is needed is commitment and communication. When we are committed to something, it means that no matter how painful or how uncomfortable something is, we will always choose to face it through instead of running away from it. Communication is making a space for discussion and talking about how you feel as opposed to just saying what the other person did wrong.

Her brother, Gavyn Boscio, 4, loves to cook. But McKenna changed her mind when she discovered that Hasbro, the toy company that produces the popular oven, only makes the toy in purple and pink--and only features girls on the box and in commercials. So instead of buying an oven, McKenna cooked up another plan. She started a campaign to get Hasbro to make a gender-neutral oven. \"I don't want them to make a boys' Easy-Bake Oven and a girls' Easy-Bake Oven,\" McKenna, from Garfield, New Jersey, told the Associated Press. \"I want them to make an Easy-Bake Oven for kids.\"    The Easy-only Bake Oven was first introduced in 1963. At the time, the stereotype was that only women cooked. Today, that's changed, in part thanks to famous male chefs like, Bobby Flay, who used an Easy-Bake Oven when he was a kid. Over the years, Hasbro says the company has featured boys on the packaging and offered the product in several different color1 schemes. But this year, just the purple and pink model is available. McKenna wants that to change, and she's not alone. Her petition , posted on change.org, has received more than 45,000 signatures.    By next summer, McKenna should have her wish. On December 17, Hasbro invited the New Jersey teen and her family to their headquarters in Pawtucket, Rhode Island, to meet with the Easy-Bake Oven team. They showed her a prototype, or model, of their newest Easy-Bake Oven, which is scheduled to hit stores in 2013. The new color1 scheme is black, silver and blue. The company also told McKenna they plan to feature boys in ads.    McKenna was happy with what she saw at Hasbro. \"They really met most or even all of what I wanted them to, and they really amazed me,\" McKenna said. She added that Gavyn thought the new design was \"awesome\". How did McKenna probably feel when she found out what kind of oven Hasbro produces? ks5u", "subject": ""}

Instead, he found a living snake, 9 - foot, 20 - pound, \"It was looking right at me. It flicked its little tongue, and I was a little frightened \"Jackson Ault said. So Ault and the woman called the local police to get help. The first officer on the scene didn't know how to control the snake like most people and was not brave at that moment. But then the police - Lt. Louis Carlos showed up and the story suddenly became much less frightening and more delightful. \"Cool, I wanted to hold it!\" Carlos told a local TV reporter about his reaction to seeing the snake. \"It was easy for me to go there, pick it up, hold it and let the snake feel the warmth of my hands and my body.\" After comforting the snake, Carlos called Animals Control Service, which brought the snake to the Santa Fe Animal Shelter.
