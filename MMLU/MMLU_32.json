Growing up as a young kid in London in a lower, middle-class family, the young John didn't attend a private school, but went to public school in Enfield, near his home. His teachers and his family's friends regarded him as an optimistic boy who liked playing and fighting much more than minding his studies.

I like this image. But it was quite by accident that I discovered the deep meaning of his words. For years we made the long drive from our home in Seattle to my parents' home in Boise in nine hours. We traveled the way most people do: the fastest, shortest, easiest road, especially when I was alone with four noisy, restless kids who hate confinement and have strong opinions about everything. Road trips felt risky, so I would drive fast, stopping only when I had to. We would stick to the freeways and arrive tired. But then Banner, our lamb was born. He was rejected by his mama days before our planned trip to Boise. I had two choices: leave Banner with my husband, or take him with me. My husband made the decision for me. That is how I found myself on the road with four kids, a baby lamb and nothing but my everlasting optimism to see me through. We took the country roads out of necessity. We had to stop every hour, let Banner shake out his legs and feed him. The kids chased him and one another. They'd get back in the car breathless and energized, smelling fresh from the cold air. We explored side roads, catching grasshoppers in waist-high grass. Even if we simply looked out of the car windows at baby pigs following their mother, or fish leaping out of the water, it was better than the best ride down the freeway. Here was life. And new horizons. We eventually arrived at my parents' doorstep astonishingly fresh and full of stories. I grew brave with the trip back home and creative with my disciplining technique. On an empty section of road, everyone started quarreling. I stopped the car, ordered all kids out and told them to meet me up ahead. I parked my car half a mile away and read my book in sweet silence. Some road trips are by necessity fast and straight. But that trip with Banner opened our eyes to a world available to anyone adventurous enough to wander around and made me realize that a detour may uncover the best part of a journey----and the best part of yourself.

I like this image. But it was quite by accident that I discovered the deep meaning of his words. For years we made the long drive from our home in Seattle to my parents' home in Boise in nine hours. We traveled the way most people do: the fastest, shortest, easiest road, especially when I was alone with four noisy, restless kids who hate confinement and have strong opinions about everything. Road trips felt risky, so I would drive fast, stopping only when I had to. We would stick to the freeways and arrive tired. But then Banner, our lamb was born. He was rejected by his mama days before our planned trip to Boise. I had two choices: leave Banner with my husband, or take him with me. My husband made the decision for me.

Even with a new coat of paint and the high wire fence, the school I knew ten years ago remains the same. Every day at 5 p.m., instead of flying kites with our friends, my brother and I had to go to Vietnamese school. No amount of kicking, screaming, or arguing could stop my mother, who was determined to have us learn the language of our culture. She held us by the collar and walked with us the seven long, hilly blocks from our home to school, leaving our tearful faces before the front of the school. We all sat in little chairs in a big empty room, which had a slight smell of old clothes that had been stored for a long time. I hated that smell. There was a stage far to the right, with an American flag on one side and the flag of the Republic of Vietnam on the other side. Although the school mainly taught language ---- speaking, reading, dictation ---- the lessons always began with an exercise in politeness. With the entrance of the teacher, the best student would tap a bell and everyone would get up, and say in Vietnamese, \"How are you, teacher?\" The language always made me embarrassed. More often than not, I had tried to separate myself from the loud voice that followed me whenever I went to the American supermarket outside our area. The voice belonged to my grandmother, a small old woman who could shout louder than anyone on the street. Her Vietnamese was quick, it was loud, and it was not beautiful. In our area, the comings and goings of hundreds of Vietnamese on their daily tasks sounded crazy. I did not want to be thought of as being mad, as talking stupid. When I spoke English, people nodded at me, smiled and encouraged me. Even Vietnamese people would laugh and say that I'd do well in life. My brother was even stricter than I about speaking English. He was especially cruel towards my mother, scolding her for her poor English. Bits of Vietnamese were often mixed in her conversation. After two years of struggle, I finally divorced my culture.

Having a good weep at the weekend is becoming more popular among office workers in China. \"I need to cry to let my feeling out,\" said 22-year-old Guo Meng, a smart-looking young woman. \"I remember one day when I got home I felt so down but I had no one to talk to, so I just curled up  with my teddy bear and cried myself to sleep,\" Guo said. The next day, she said, she felt much better and life seemed not so bad after all. Because crying is taken as a sign of weakness, people make a great show of being strong and not displaying emotion. Psychologists and medical practitioners agree that crying is beneficial for mental health but people still regard it as a sign of failure and bottle up their feelings. A famous Chinese author once said to cry is normal, and even brave. Those who display their emotions can deal with their troubles bravely after the tears dry, while those who soldier on let problems fester . In the Chaoyang district of Beijing, there is a special place for people to cry their sadness out. It is called \"Cry Bar\". On the door of each of its \"cry rooms\" there is a saying encouraging people to let the tears flow freely. \"Crying is a kind of therapy, but it needs some direction,\" said Milulu, a psychologist. \"People should realize the point of crying is to relieve pressure, but some of the young people who come to the Cry Bar simply sit and weep. The purpose of crying is to make it easier to improve your life after the tears dry, not to get lost in bad memories.\" Crying is only one way of relieving pressure, and we need to face problems squarely and solve them once the tears have dried, said Mululu.

The 44 per cent reduction translates to an 'age-adjusted survival benefit' of 6.2 years in men and 5.6 years in women, according to Dr. Peter Schnohr, chief cardiologist from the Copenhagen City Heart study.

His team compared the body size of animals between the Cambrian Period and modern times. This was a span of 542 million years. The animals studied included species from more than 17,000 genera. They ranged from ancient trilobites, plesiosaurs (extinct reptiles with a long neck and flippers) and many less familiar creatures to today's whales and clams. Ocean animals today are an average of 150 times larger than they were during the Cambrian, Heim's group reports. The smallest animals alive today -- tiny crustaceans called ostracods -- are only about one-tenth the size of the Cambrian's tiniest animals. But today's largest ocean animals -- whales -- are more than 100,000 times bigger than the biggest in the Cambrian. \"Classes of animals that were already big ... tended to live longer,\" Heim says. They also tended to change more than classes of animals that were small did. The size gains in ocean animals are much larger than would be expected by chance, saysJonathan Payne. He's a co-author who also works at Stanford. The scientists don't know what drives the trend. One possibility is an arms race between predators and prey. The idea here is that larger animals are less likely to become some other animals' meal. Another possibility has to do with oxygen. Land animals evolved from species that started in the ocean. Some of these land animals eventually returned to the ocean. And they kept the ability to breathe oxygen-rich air. That may have made it easier for them to outgrow animals that had to filter their oxygen out of the water. The ocean animals' change in size   _  .", "subject": ""}

King Tutankhamen Artifacts A traveling exhibition of artifacts from the tomb of King Tutankhamen, popularly known as \"King Tut\", toured the United States from November 1976 to April 1979. The 55 objects were shown in six cities and were seen by around eight million museum-goers. The second touring exhibit was started in 2007, this time with 130 artifacts and stops in London and three different American cities. However some objects, like the king's golden face mask, are too valuable or too delicate to be transported long distances, so \"replicas\" (exact copies of something) are on show. Japanese Color Woodblock Prints The Art Museum at University of Virginia, in Charlottesville, Virginia, has an extraordinary collection of Japanese color woodblock prints  . These prints document the period from about 1850 to 1900, a time when Japan was opening itself to Western influences. Before this point, Japan was a closed society that had little communication with the world outside of its borders. These works of art beautifully show the feeling of change and the trend toward modernization. The museum has put together a traveling exhibition of 60 of these prints, which can be borrowed and exhibited worldwide for periods of eight weeks or more.

The 55 objects were shown in six cities and were seen by around eight million museum-goers. The second touring exhibit was started in 2007, this time with 130 artifacts and stops in London and three different American cities. However some objects, like the king's golden face mask, are too valuable or too delicate to be transported long distances, so \"replicas\" (exact copies of something) are on show. Japanese Color Woodblock Prints The Art Museum at University of Virginia, in Charlottesville, Virginia, has an extraordinary collection of Japanese color woodblock prints  . These prints document the period from about 1850 to 1900, a time when Japan was opening itself to Western influences. Before this point, Japan was a closed society that had little communication with the world outside of its borders. These works of art beautifully show the feeling of change and the trend toward modernization. The museum has put together a traveling exhibition of 60 of these prints, which can be borrowed and exhibited worldwide for periods of eight weeks or more. Face-to-face with \"Lucy\" One of the world's most famous archaeological   finds in history are the 3.2 million-year-old bones of a 106-centimeter-tall female found in the Ethiopian desert in 1974. Lucy, a name given to her by the discovery team, is a \"hominid\", or a creature that scientists believe is the earliest ancestor of modern human beings.

But until the 1750's all the dictionaries were rather crude and not very valuable. A man named Dr Samuel Johnson changed all this. In 1755 Dr Johnson produced the first modern dictionary. He included in his dictionary all important words, both easy and hard, and he gave good meanings. He also gave good sentences to show how each word was actually used in speech and in writing. By the end of the 1700's most dictionary makers had followed Johnson's example. Dictionaries were getting better and better. The 1800's saw the greatest improvement in the quality of dictionaries. In England scholars planned and prepared the Oxford English Dictionary, a twenty-volume (;;) work. One of the most interesting features of the Oxford Dictionary is its word histories. It traces (;) the history of each word from its earliest recorded use up to the time of the printing of the dictionary. This passage is mainly about   _  .", "subject": ""}

Poor relationship between parents and their children are very common. Whether we like it or not, our parents are responsible for us at least until we're out of high school.

When I find myself arguing with my mom and dad, I try to stop. If I can manage to stop myself from talking, I usually find that I can calm down quickly.

You'd be amazed at how much easier it is to communicate with your parents when you've actually looking at them. Looking away doesn't do much of anything except for giving them the impression that I'm not listening or that I don't care.

When I argue with my parents, I can physically hear what they're saying without mentally listening to it.

{"answer": 3, "choices": ["People are curious in the same way.", "People in different countries are interested in different things.", "Men and women are curious about different things.", "People of different ages are interested in different things"], "question": "As children grow up, they become curious about different kinds of things. When they are babies, they are interested in the parts of their bodies and in the smiles of their mothers. The they become interested in the physical world around them: the plants, the animals, the sky. Later, they become interested in the things that people have made: wheels, bicycles, cars. And when they are adults, their curiosity continues. Sometimes this curiosity leads to a career (, ) in science. Scientists spend their lives trying to find out about the world. Those who work with the earth sciences study the earth, the oceans, and the skies. Other scientists who study living things work with the biological sciences. A third group of scientists study the physical sciences, e. g. physics, chemistry . These scientists have already discovered a lot about our world. For example, they tell us why your heart beats fast when you run. They say that when you are quiet, your heart normally beats sixty-five or seventy-five times a minute. Your heart is a pump   that pumps blood to all parts of the body. The blood carries oxygen and nutrition. When you run, your muscles work very hard and use the nutrition that the blood carries to them. The muscles need oxygen, too . So your brain sends a signal to the heart. The signal means that the muscles need more nutrition and oxygen. Then the heart beats fast and sends blood quickly to the muscles. It may beat 90 to 140 times a minute. Of course, scientists cannot answer all of our questions. If we ask, \"Why does the ocean water taste salty?\" Scientists will say that the salt comes from rocks. When a rock gets very hot or very cold, it cracks. Rain falls into cracks. The rain then carries the salt into the earth and into the rivers. The rivers carry the salt into the ocean. But then we ask , \"What happens to the salt in the ocean? The ocean does not get saltier every year.\" Scientists are not sure about the answer to this question.

And when they are adults, their curiosity continues. Sometimes this curiosity leads to a career (, ) in science. Scientists spend their lives trying to find out about the world. Those who work with the earth sciences study the earth, the oceans, and the skies. Other scientists who study living things work with the biological sciences. A third group of scientists study the physical sciences, e. g. physics, chemistry . These scientists have already discovered a lot about our world. For example, they tell us why your heart beats fast when you run. They say that when you are quiet, your heart normally beats sixty-five or seventy-five times a minute. Your heart is a pump   that pumps blood to all parts of the body. The blood carries oxygen and nutrition. When you run, your muscles work very hard and use the nutrition that the blood carries to them. The muscles need oxygen, too . So your brain sends a signal to the heart. The signal means that the muscles need more nutrition and oxygen. Then the heart beats fast and sends blood quickly to the muscles. It may beat 90 to 140 times a minute. Of course, scientists cannot answer all of our questions. If we ask, \"Why does the ocean water taste salty?\" Scientists will say that the salt comes from rocks. When a rock gets very hot or very cold, it cracks. Rain falls into cracks. The rain then carries the salt into the earth and into the rivers. The rivers carry the salt into the ocean. But then we ask , \"What happens to the salt in the ocean? The ocean does not get saltier every year.\" Scientists are not sure about the answer to this question.

{"answer": 2, "choices": ["It burns merely plant matter.", "It keeps producing electricity.", "It stores the energy from the sun.", "It produces zero carbon dioxide"], "question": "The oldest and most common source of renewable energy known to man, biomass  is one of the most important forms energy production in the United States and elsewhere. Since such a wide variety of biomass materials is everywhere --- from trees and grasses to agricultural and city --- life wastes ---biomass promises to play a continuing role in providing power and heat for millions of people around the world. According to the Union of Concerned Scientists(UCS), biomass is a kind of renewable energy source that produces no carbon dioxide , because the energy it contains comes from the sun. When plant matter is burned, it gives off the sun's energy. In this way, biomass serves as a sort of natural battery  for storing the sun's energy. As long as biomass is produced continuously ---with only as much grown as is used-- the \"battery\" lasts forever. According to the Energy Information Administration, biomass has been one of the leading renewable energy sources in the United States for several years running through 2007, making up between 0.5 and 0.9 percent of the nation's total electricity supply. In 2008---although the numbers aren't all in yet---wind power probably took over first place because of the rapid development of wind farms across the country. Producing power from biomass helps reduce some 11 million tons of carbon dioxide each year. Some homeowners also try to make their own heat by using biomass materials. Such practice may save homeowner's money, but it also produces a lot of pollution. So, the best way is to encourage power plants to use it.

This can't be happening to me. Then I felt the gun, cold, against my head, and I heard my friend Jeremy saying, \"What do you want? Take my wallet,\" but at the time I thought of nothing. I remember being a little annoyed when the gunman pulled me from the car by the hair. I remember the walk to the house --- Jeremy, me, the two men with two guns. I remember the fear and anger in the gunmen's voices because Jeremy was being slow, and I remember wondering why he was being slow. I did not realize that Jeremy had thrown the keys into the bush. But I remember that sound of the gun hitting Jeremy's head and the feeling as the man who had hold of my hair released me. And I remember the split second when I realized he was looking at Jeremy, and I remember wondering how far I could run before he pulled the trigger. But I was already running, and upon reaching the car across the street, I didn't crouch  behind it but screamed instead. I remember thinking there was something ridiculous and illogical about screaming \"Help, help!\" at eight o'clock on a Tuesday evening in December and changing my plea  to the more specific \"Help, let me in, please let me in!\" But the houses were cold, closed, unfriendly, and I ran on until I heard Jeremy's screams behind me announcing that our attackers had fled. The neighbors who had not opened their doors to us came out with baseball bats and helped Jeremy find his glasses and keys. In a group they were very brave. We waited for the police to come until someone said to someone else that the noodles were getting cold, and I said politely, \"Please go and eat. We're O.K.\" I was happy to see them go. They had been talking of stricter sentences for criminals, of bringing back the death penalty  and how the President is going to clean up the country. I was thinking, they could be saying all of this over my dead body, and I still feel that stiffer sentences wouldn't change a thing. In a rush all the anger I should have felt for my attackers was directed against these contented people standing in front of their warm, comfortable homes talking about all the guns they were going to buy. What good would guns have been to Jeremy and me? People all over the neighborhood had called to report our screams, and the police turned out in force twenty minutes later. They were ill-tempered about what was, to them, much trouble about nothing. After all, Jeremy was hardly hurt, and we were hopeless when it came to describing the gunmen. \"Typical,\" said one policeman when we couldn't even agree on how tall the men were. Both of us were able to describe the guns in horrifying detail, but the two policemen who stayed to make the report didn't think that would be much help. The policemen were matter-of-fact about the whole thing. The thin one said, \"That was a stupid thing to do, throwing away the keys. When a man has a gun against your head you do what you're told.\" Jeremy looked properly embarrassed. Then the fat policeman came up and the thin one went to look around the outside of the house. \"That was the best thing you could have done, throwing away the keys,\" he said. \"If you had gone into the house with them...\" His voice became weaker. \"They would have hurt her\" --- he twisted his head toward me - \"and killed you both.\" Jeremy looked happier. \"Look,\" said the fat policeman kindly, \"there's no right or wrong in the situation. There's just luck.\" All that sleepless night I replayed the moment those black gloves came up to the car window. How long did the whole thing last? Three minutes, five, eight? No matter how many hours of my life I may spend reliving it, I know there is no way to prepare for the next time --- no intelligent response to a gun. The fat cop was right. There's only luck.

Although it may not sound very high quality, the film won the Palme d'Or   for Best Film and the award for Best Director at the Cannes film festival.

The film takes a close look at a few hours in the lives of the victims and the killers. It shows how high school is a different experience for everyone---fun and friendly, or hard and lonely. In many ways, the two boys, who carry out the shooting, act like ordinary kids. They joke around with one boy's mother as she serves them cakes and play the piano. But there're hints of the anger they feel inside. One of the boys is bullied   at school. The other plays violent video games.

For her, it was simply a continuation of a commitment   that she has made to teenagers to do what she can to inspire and motivate them while letting them know there are people who believe in them.   Kimberly is the coauthor of the bestseller, Chicken Soup for the Teenage Soul and the New York Times bestseller, Chicken Soup for the Teenage Soul II, as well as Chicken Soup for the Teenage Soul Journal  . She is also the co-author of the forthcoming Chicken Soup for the Parent's Soul and Chicken Soup for the Teenage Soul III, and the author of Teen Love: On Relationships, a Book for Teenagers.   Kimberly started the Teen Letter Project with Jack Canfield, Mark Victor Hansen and Health Communications, Inc. The Project is responsible for answering the heartfelt   letters received from teenagers and also reaching out to teens in trouble and encouraging them to seek professional help.

You are probably better at some school subjects than others. These may show strengths that you can use in your work. A boy who is good at mathematics can use that in an engineering career. A girl who spells well and likes English may be good at office work. So it is important to know the subjects you do well in at school. On the other hand, you may not have any especially strong subjects but your records show a general satisfactory standard. Although not all subjects can be used directly in a job, they may have indirect value. A knowledge of history is not required for most jobs but if history is one of your good subjects you will have learned to remember facts and details. This is an ability that can be useful in many jobs. Your school may have taught you skills, such as typing or technical drawing, which you can use in your work. You may be good at metalwork or cookery and look for a job where you can improve these skills. If you have had a part-time job on Saturdays or in the summer, think what you gained from it. If nothing else, you may have learned how to get to work on time, to follow instructions and to get on with older workers. You may have learned to give correct change in a shop, for example. Just as important, you may become interested in a particular industry or career you see from the inside in a part-time job. Facing your weak points is also part of knowing yourself. You may _ when you handle tools; perhaps you are a poor speller or cannot add up a column of figures. It is better to face any weakness than to pretend they do not exist.

Unfortunately, the mystery ship had stopped directly in front of the California, preventing people on board from seeing clearly.

{"answer": 1, "choices": ["The Emotional Well-being", "The Two Saddest Words", "The Most Useful Rule", "The Peace of Mind"], "question": "Two of the saddest words in the English language are \"if only\". I live my life with the goal of never having to say those words, because they convey regret, lost opportunities, mistakes, and disappointment. My father is famous in our family for saying, \"Take the extra minute to do it right.\" I always try to live by the \"extra minute\" rule. When my children were young and likely to cause accidents, I always thought about what I could do to avoid an \"if only\" moment, whether it was something minor like moving a cup full of hot coffee away from the edge of a counter, or something that required a little more work such as taping padding   onto the sharp corners of a glass coffee table. I don't only avoid those \"if only\" moments when it comes to safety. It's equally important to avoid \"if only\" in our personal relationships. We all know people who lost a loved one and regretted that they had _ an opportunity to say \"I love you\" or \"I forgive you.\" When my father announced he was going to the eye doctor across from my office on Good Friday, I told him that it was a holiday for my company and I wouldn't be here. But then I thought about the fact that he's 84 years old and I realized that I shouldn't give up an opportunity to see him. I called him and told him I had decided to go to work on my day off after all. I know there will still be occasions when I have to say \"if only\" about something, but my life is definitely better because of my policy of doing everything possible to avoid that eventuality. And even though it takes an extra minute to do something right, or it occasionally takes an hour or two in my busy schedule to make a personal connection, I know that I'm doing the right thing. I'm buying myself peace of mind and that's the best kind of insurance for my emotional well-being. W hat is the best title for the passage?", "subject": ""}

Diaz is a \"cable racer\", and every morning he faces the difficult task of taking the local teacher to her school. To do this, he first walks for an hour up to a place the locals call Los Pinos, right at the edge of the 400-foot deep gorge of the Negro valley. Here, one end of a thick metal cable has been fixed to a wooden post. The cable stretches right across the deep valley to the other side, a kilometer away. A metal hook is fixed to the cable, with leather straps hanging from it. Diaz fastens the straps around his shoulders and waist, does a quick safety check and then, without hesitating, throws himself off the edge of the mountain. Attached to the cable by only the metal hook, he rapidly picks up speed and soon he is racing through the air. Crossing the valley by wire takes him 30 seconds, instead of the two hours it would take him to walk down through the rain forest and climb up the steep muddy slopes on the other side. As Diaz begins his trip, Diana Rios, a 23-year-old elementary teacher, is waiting on the other side of the gorge for the moment when he will come racing through the mist towards her at 100 mph. She will then return with him, hanging on to him as he goes back along the cable. Diana had no idea when she took the teaching job that just getting to work in the village school would be dangerous. \"At first I wanted to cry,\" she says, clutching her hook as the metal cable starts to rattle  violently at Diaz's approach. \"But I soon got used to it.\" She still prefers to go with Diaz, though, rather than making the frightening and dangerous crossing on her own.

All that I hated was the war...\" That's how my great-aunt Bettie began her story. I heard it many times as a child, whenever my family visited Aunt Bettie in the old house in Berryville,   Virginia. Bettie Van Metre had good reason to hate the Civil War. Her brother was killed at Gettysburg, and her husband, James, a Confederate officer, was taken prisoner and sent to an unknown prison camp somewhere. One day in late September, Dick came to Bettie reporting that he had found a wounded Union soldier in a farmhouse half a mile away from the Van Metre home. When talking about her first sight of the man in the blood-spotted blue uniform, she always used the same words. _ She went out into the cool air, trying not to be sick at the thought of that smashed right hand, that missing left leg. The man's papers Bettie found in the farmhouse showed his identity: Henry Bedell, 30 years old. She knew that she should report the presence of this Union officer to the Confederate army, but she wouldn't. This is how she explained it: \"I kept wondering if he had a wife somewhere, hoping, and not knowing--just as I was. It seemed to me that the only thing that mattered was to get her husband back to her.\" Slowly, patiently, skillfully, Aunt Bettie fanned the spark of life in Henry Bedell. Of drugs or medicines she had almost none. And she was not willing to take any from the few supplies at the Confederate hospital. But she did the best she could with what she had. The October nights in the valley grew cold. With the help of Dick and his wife, she moved the Union officer at night, to a hidden room above the warm kitchen of her own home. But the next day, Bedell had a high fever. Knowing that she must get help, she went to her family doctor, Graham Osborne. Dr. Osborne examined Bedell and said, \"there was little hope unless proper medicines could be found.\" \"I'll get them from the Yankees at Harpers Ferry.\" Bettie said. The doctor told her that Harpers Ferry was almost 20 miles away. Even if she reached them, the Yankees would never believe her. \"I'll take proof,\" Bettie said. She found a blood-spotted paper bearing the official War Department seal  . \"When I show it, they'll believe me.\" Early the next morning she set off with a list of medical items. For five hours she drove, stopping only to rest her horse. The sun was almost down when she finally stood before the general at  Harpers Ferry. The general listened, but did not believe her. \"Madam,\" he said, \"Bedell's death was reported to us.\" \"He's alive,\" Bettie insisted. \"But he won't be much longer unless he has the medicines on that list.\" \"Well,\" the general turned to a junior officer, \"see that Mrs. Van Metre gets the supplies.\" With the medicines, Bedell gradually recovered. Ten days later he was walking with sticks. \"I'd better go back as soon as possible.\" Bedell told Bettie. So it was arranged that Dick should help Bettie deliver Bedell to Harpers Ferry in his wagon. Bedell lay down in a box filled with hay, his rifle and sticks beside him. At Harpers Ferry, the soldiers were amazed when the Union officer with the missing leg rose from his hay-filled box. Bedell told the story to Secretary of War Edwin M. Stanton, who wrote a letter of thanks to Bettie and signed an order to free James Van Metre. It was arranged for Bedell to go with Bettie as she searched for her husband.

I heard it many times as a child, whenever my family visited Aunt Bettie in the old house in Berryville,   Virginia. Bettie Van Metre had good reason to hate the Civil War. Her brother was killed at Gettysburg, and her husband, James, a Confederate officer, was taken prisoner and sent to an unknown prison camp somewhere. One day in late September, Dick came to Bettie reporting that he had found a wounded Union soldier in a farmhouse half a mile away from the Van Metre home. When talking about her first sight of the man in the blood-spotted blue uniform, she always used the same words. _ She went out into the cool air, trying not to be sick at the thought of that smashed right hand, that missing left leg. The man's papers Bettie found in the farmhouse showed his identity: Henry Bedell, 30 years old. She knew that she should report the presence of this Union officer to the Confederate army, but she wouldn't. This is how she explained it: \"I kept wondering if he had a wife somewhere, hoping, and not knowing--just as I was. It seemed to me that the only thing that mattered was to get her husband back to her.\" Slowly, patiently, skillfully, Aunt Bettie fanned the spark of life in Henry Bedell. Of drugs or medicines she had almost none. And she was not willing to take any from the few supplies at the Confederate hospital. But she did the best she could with what she had. The October nights in the valley grew cold. With the help of Dick and his wife, she moved the Union officer at night, to a hidden room above the warm kitchen of her own home. But the next day, Bedell had a high fever. Knowing that she must get help, she went to her family doctor, Graham Osborne. Dr. Osborne examined Bedell and said, \"there was little hope unless proper medicines could be found.\" \"I'll get them from the Yankees at Harpers Ferry.\" Bettie said. The doctor told her that Harpers Ferry was almost 20 miles away. Even if she reached them, the Yankees would never believe her. \"I'll take proof,\" Bettie said. She found a blood-spotted paper bearing the official War Department seal  . \"When I show it, they'll believe me.\" Early the next morning she set off with a list of medical items. For five hours she drove, stopping only to rest her horse. The sun was almost down when she finally stood before the general at  Harpers Ferry. The general listened, but did not believe her. \"Madam,\" he said, \"Bedell's death was reported to us.\" \"He's alive,\" Bettie insisted. \"But he won't be much longer unless he has the medicines on that list.\" \"Well,\" the general turned to a junior officer, \"see that Mrs. Van Metre gets the supplies.\" With the medicines, Bedell gradually recovered. Ten days later he was walking with sticks. \"I'd better go back as soon as possible.\" Bedell told Bettie. So it was arranged that Dick should help Bettie deliver Bedell to Harpers Ferry in his wagon. Bedell lay down in a box filled with hay, his rifle and sticks beside him. At Harpers Ferry, the soldiers were amazed when the Union officer with the missing leg rose from his hay-filled box. Bedell told the story to Secretary of War Edwin M. Stanton, who wrote a letter of thanks to Bettie and signed an order to free James Van Metre. It was arranged for Bedell to go with Bettie as she searched for her husband.

I loaded my materials into the pickup truck and arrived early at the farmer's market to find a good spot. There were many customers and several other tradesmen. Probably because I was young and new, potential customers would look at me and smile, then head straight to my competitor, Mrs Cates, who had been in the market for years and had an established following. At the end of the first day, about half of my corn was left, so I donated it to a local homeless shelter and went home disappointed. Soon I noticed that Mrs Cates and her crew did not arrive at the farmer's market until about 11 am. So I decided to show up an hour earlier. This meant that we had to start picking corn at 6 am, no easy task with teenage workers. But the effort paid off; I was selling half of my corn before Mrs Cates arrived and most of it by the end of the day. Although the farmer's market was only open three days a week, the corn needed to be picked and sold daily because it would not keep. On days the farmer's market was not open, I developed a marketing plan that included sending e-mails to family and friends. I also went to local businesses to sell corn and distribute business cards. Customers began calling, and I took orders over the phone. Before I knew it, I had a loyal following. I stayed busy by making weekly and sometimes daily deliveries to these businesses while maintaining my produce stand at the farmer's market. Then something wonderful happened. I had made more money than any of my friends with typical teenage jobs. I feel a sense of accomplishment when I see people buy produce from me.

Surrounded by cows and cornfields, I was unsure of what to do. However, I did enjoy the beauty and peace of the countryside. On the farm, I helped with odd jobs like feeding cows. When I was old enough to get a real summer job, my step-father said I could choose between two options--getting a job at our local Dairy Queen or selling produce that I grew on our farm. While I came up with a short list of pros   for working at the fast food restaurant, I found more advantages to selling produce. Yet I realized the numerous disadvantages to selling produce: responsibility for the success or failure of the operation, early mornings, and long days. At last, I decided to start my own farming business. My stepfather and I began planning in March. Together we chose three varieties of seeds, prepared the land, and planted the first batch   of sweet corn at the end of April. Throughout the spring, my stepfather continued to plant sweet corn every two weeks as I rode in the tractor with him. The sweet corn needs taking great care while growing. As the corn was putting forth ears, we applied fertilizer and sprayed pesticide to prevent worms. I watched them grow taller and taller, dreaming about the money I would soon make. We planned to harvest and sell the corn at our local farmer's market. It sounded easy and looked good on paper, but it worked out a little differently. Nonstop rain delayed the harvest by a week or so. When my sweet corn was finally ready to pick, I found that a pack of raccoons   had visited the field at night, ruining about half of it.

I hadn't been able to sleep and I was stuck in a too small tent with my wife and two kids. \"Things haven't worked out,\" I said to myself. But, like so many other things I complain before my morning coffee, this one was ridiculously off-key. Things weren't bad; they were good. A hundred yards(91 meters) away was Summit Lake, with its wonderful early morning mists   shimmering off the water. A couple of miles to the southwest was the base of the Lassen Peak Trail. The base was 8,000 feet (2,400 meters) above sea level, huge snow banks dotting  the place even in mid August. It was beautiful. We fired up the camp stove, got out our cold boxes from the heavy metal locker ,fired up some bacon, cut open some bread, and boiled up a cup of coffee.  Half an hour later, my 6-year-old daughter and I were in the parking lot of the Lassen Peak Trail, getting ready to hike. We wouldn't make it all the way-- young legs get pretty tired on a steep mountain path, but it didn't matter. We would see great views spread out below us, the volcanic ash that layered on the earth turning the melting snow a mysterious pink as the sun struck it. Later, on the hike, I felt stupid about my morning complaints. Everything had been worthwhile. It gave me enormous satisfaction to see my daughter so excited about the view from the mountain. Yes, camping is uncomfortable. But there's also something wonderful about being so close to nature. Just as importantly, there's something about getting young children out of their increasingly technology-filled comfort zones and forcing them to encounter the non-cyber world around them. We lose something when we spend all our time cocooned  inside a carefully constructed modernity, when read about daily affronts   to the environment, yet don't fully realize what is at risk, removed as we are from nature.

{"answer": 0, "choices": ["is looking forward to her father's return", "feels ashamed that her father was lost", "is unsatisfied with the government", "can't get well with her family members"], "question": "I am sitting in the examination hall among my classmates with a sheet of questions in front of me. The only difference between my classmates and me is that they are all busy filling out their sheets, while I am just sitting, staring at the wall in front of me. My mind silently fights to keep memories as I search for something to start this essay   with--an essay about a man who was taken away from me before I was old enough to say his name. With no words coming to my rescue, I helplessly glance down at the title of the essay: \"My Father\". Since I do not have a clear recollection of him, I can only describe him on the basis of what I have heard from my mother and other  s. They all told me that he was caring, hardworking, a man of his word and did everything to keep his family happy. They stop talking about him as suddenly as he disappeared from our lives. He went to work one day and never returned. My mother ran from hospitals to police stations and even to mortuaries   but found no trace of him. He was gone as if he never existed. While growing up I could never understand what actually happened to him but there were times when I heard people talking in whispers about how he was taken away by security forces because he was against the state. I do not know how far that is true but what I would like to know is how that is possible? He was an ordinary man working day in and day out to make ends meet and put food on our table. He was least concerned about the state of affairs in Pakistan.

Play is important to healthy brain development. Play allows children to create and explore a world they can master, conquering their fears while practicing adult roles. Undirected play allows children to learn how to work in groups, to share, to negotiate, and to resolve conflicts. Ideally, much of play involves adults, but when play is controlled by adults, children acquiesce   to adult rules and concerns and lose some of the benefits play offers them, particularly in developing creativity, leadership, and group skills. In contrast to passive entertainment, play builds active, healthy bodies. In fact, it has been suggested that encouraging unstructured play may be an exceptional way to increase physical activity levels in children, which is one important strategy in the resolution of the obesity problem. Children's development is critically influenced by appropriate, affective relationships with loving and consistent caregivers as they relate to children through play. When parents observe their children in play or join with them in child-driven play, they are given a unique opportunity to see the world from their children's vantage point as the child navigates a world perfectly created just to fit his or her needs. The interactions that occur through play tell children that parents are fully paying attention to them and help to build enduring relationships. Parents who have the opportunity to look at their children's world learn to communicate more effectively with their children and are given another setting to offer guidance. Less verbal children may be able to express their views, giving their parents an opportunity to gain a fuller understanding of their perspective.

The commitment announced Wednesday represents Apple's latest attempt to prevent the popularity of its devices and digital services from increasing the carbon emissions that are widely believed to change the Earth's climate. Apple Inc. estimates   20 million tons of greenhouse gas pollution will be avoided as more of its suppliers rely on renewable energy between now and 2020. That's like having four million fewer cars on the road for a year. Panels capable of generating   about 200 megawatts of solar power will be financed by Apple in the northern, southern and eastern regions of China, where many of its suppliers are located. The company is teaming up with its Chinese suppliers to build the capacity for the remaining 2 gigawatts of renewable energy, which will be a mix of solar, wind and hydroelectric power. Foxconn, which runs the factory where the most iPhones are assembled, is pledging to contribute 400 megawatts of solar power as part of the 2-gigawatt commitment. The solar panels to be built by 2018 in China's Henan Province are supposed to produce as much renewable energy as Foxconn's Zhengzhou factory consumes while making iPhones. Apple has made protecting the environment a higher priority since Tim Cook replaced the late Steve Jobs as the company's CEO four years ago. \"Climate change is one of the great challenges of our time, and the time for action is now,\" Cook said in a statement. \"The transition to a new green economy requires innovation, ambition and purpose.\" Apple just completed projects in China that generate 40 megawatts of solar energy to cover the power required by its 24 stores and 19 offices in the country.

The world's most valuable company is working with its Chinese suppliers to eventually produce 2.2 gigawatts of solar power and other renewable energy. The commitment announced Wednesday represents Apple's latest attempt to prevent the popularity of its devices and digital services from increasing the carbon emissions that are widely believed to change the Earth's climate. Apple Inc. estimates   20 million tons of greenhouse gas pollution will be avoided as more of its suppliers rely on renewable energy between now and 2020. That's like having four million fewer cars on the road for a year. Panels capable of generating   about 200 megawatts of solar power will be financed by Apple in the northern, southern and eastern regions of China, where many of its suppliers are located. The company is teaming up with its Chinese suppliers to build the capacity for the remaining 2 gigawatts of renewable energy, which will be a mix of solar, wind and hydroelectric power. Foxconn, which runs the factory where the most iPhones are assembled, is pledging to contribute 400 megawatts of solar power as part of the 2-gigawatt commitment. The solar panels to be built by 2018 in China's Henan Province are supposed to produce as much renewable energy as Foxconn's Zhengzhou factory consumes while making iPhones. Apple has made protecting the environment a higher priority since Tim Cook replaced the late Steve Jobs as the company's CEO four years ago. \"Climate change is one of the great challenges of our time, and the time for action is now,\" Cook said in a statement. \"The transition to a new green economy requires innovation, ambition and purpose.\" Apple just completed projects in China that generate 40 megawatts of solar energy to cover the power required by its 24 stores and 19 offices in the country. All of Apple's data centers, offices and stores in the U.S. already have been running on renewable energy. \"When you look at all the air pollution in China, all the manufacturing that is done there has a lot to do with it, so this is a significant step in the right direction,\" said Gary Cook, a senior analyst for Greenpeace, a group devoted to protecting the environment. Apple also has a financial motivation to help make China a better place to live.

If you're taking an international flight on Samoa Air today, your fare will be based on your weight, along with that of your luggage. The cost is 93 cents to $1.06 for each kilogram. The average American woman weighs 75.5 kilograms, far from the ideal weight for her average height. Her ticket on Samoa Air, at the $1 a kilogram rate, would cost $75.50. But let's be honest here. Since the average American woman is overweight, the ticket will cost her more. Samoa Air Chief Executive Chris Langton said, \"Planes are run by weight and not by seat. The plane can only carry a certain amount of weight and that weight needs to be paid.\"He believes other airlines should adopt the policy. It' s not a new idea.

The TV shows like \"Children are hard to support!\", \"Where are we going, Dad?\", \"hot mom\" and \"cute kids\" are becoming more and more popular. All of these show the new parents' confusion in children's education and the appeal for the balance between career and family. In real life, on the one hand, the young parents feel helpless because they are too busy to accompany their children under the pressures of work and life; on the other hand, they continue to do so. The data collected by HNTV show that nearly two-thirds of their audience are female, among whom 36% are aged from 25 to 34. We can imagine such a scene that one evening a young mother is watching the show with her young children, while her husband is still at work or trapped in socializing, or maybe is just playing computer games in the bedroom. The story of a child without the company of father is still going on. In fact, it is sometimes the same to mothers. In a modern family, it is often the old who take the responsibility for raising a child. The participation of mother in the children's education is also very low. It is just this kind of confusion where the parents have gone in the modern family education, and where the parents will guide their children to go that \"Where are we going, Dad?\" shows us. If a child wants to grow up healthily and safely into a modern citizen with independent personality and free spirit, it is very important for him or her to follow the parents who serve as their first teacher.

First, improvements started with the change in the relationship between the school and students to create a caring atmosphere at the school. Using the \"Capturing Kids' Hearts\" strategies, school leadership and teachers began building a trusting environment and students and families described seeing changes aimed at improving student outcomes and ensuring the success of every student. The school day was altered to add more options for students to obtain additional credits toward graduation. Students and teachers were grouped into \"houses,\" so that smaller groups of teachers and counselors could create one-on-one relationships with students. Teachers and counselors said that the altered school day provides time to address student's individual concerns and develop individualized learning plans to put every student on a path to graduation. The school also made changes to encourage parents to support school and encourage real dialogues between parents and the teachers and leaders at Western. Funded in part through the United Way, the school created a family engagement center to get parents more involved in their children's education, particularly parents of English language learners.

I jump out of bed each morning, eager to start an active day. But I can hear my neighbour's        alarm clock ringing non-stop every morning and I doubt he gets to work on time. A lot of noise comes from his flat in the evening. He's happy to stay up watching TV till after midnight, while I go to bed early and try to sleep. Well, it might not be his fault after all. I'm called 'a lark  ' and my neighbour 'an owl  '. We all have inside 'clocks' in the brain to control all kinds of bodily functions and it is reset every day by light. These inside clocks run to a different schedule in 'larks' and 'owls'. If you have a fast clock, you like to do things early, and if you have a slow clock, you like to do things late. Because we live in a 24/7 world, scientists believe it's important to understand a person's 'chronotype' - the time of the day when they function the best. It could help us lead a healthier life. A US professor has studied sleeping patterns and thinks work times should be changed and made more individual to fit in with our chronotypes. And he has advice for those who can't choose their working hours: \"If that's not possible, we should be more careful about light exposure\", says the professor. \"You should try to go to work not in a covered vehicle but on a bike.

Fifteen subjects who did not wear casts served as the control group.

This was repeated four times in a row followed by a one-minute break for a total of 13 rounds per session and five sessions per week. The other half performed no imagination exercises. At the end of the four-week experiment, both groups who wore casts had lost strength in their unmoving limbs   when compared to the control group. But the group that performed imagination exercises lost 50% less strength than the non-imagination group. The nervous system's ability to fully make the muscle recover also returned more quickly in the imagination group compared to the non-imagination group.

If so,  pay attention to kinds of things that happen lower to the ground.  Next, close your eyes, and picture in your mind the nature that surrounds you. The point is to sense that you are in a beautiful place.    Do something peaceful, such as fishing or meditating in the woods. You will be amazed at how relaxing it is to just sit back and enjoy the natural sounds of the woods and birds.    Go on a hike.

The inside of the earth is relatively close, but how can we get there? The deepest oil well enters a mere six miles into the crust   (the center of the earth is about 4,000 miles deeper). Russian scientists dug the deepest hole in Siberia, but bottomed out at about 7.5 miles below the surface. The Mohole project, a U.S. plan in the 1950s, called for drilling a hole 25 miles down to the boundary between the hard rocks of the crust and the soft mantle  . Sadly the project involved government supporting. It gets harder and harder to drill deep into the earth because rocks get softer and softer. Hard but easily broken at the surface, rocks become plastic at depth, and the pressure caused by the weight of the overlaying crust ---  about 52,800 pounds per square inch at a depth of ten miles, makes further drilling impossible. What little we know about the inside of the earth (like the fact that there's a crust, a mantle, and a core) comes from indirect evidence, such as the analysis of earthquakes. So maybe it's time for a thorough new method to explore the earth's inside. Scientist David Stevenson says we should forget about drilling holes. Instead, we should open a crack  . Stevenson suggests digging a crack about a half mile long, a yard wide, and a half mile deep (not with a shovel) but with an explosion on the scale of a nuclear bomb. Next, he'd pour a few hundred thousand tons of molten   iron into the crack, along with a robot. The iron, thicker than the surrounding crust, would move downward at about 16 feet per second, carrying the robot with it and opening the crack deeper and deeper. The iron mass would drop for about a week and 2,000 miles to the outer edge of the earth core, the robot sending out data to the surface. Stevenson compares his idea to space exploration. \"We're going somewhere we haven't been before,\"he says. \"In all possibility, there will be surprises.\" This idea can probably be put in the drawer marked with Isn't Going To Happen. The robot would have to survive temperatures that would melt pretty much anything. But Stevenson's idea may inspire a new look at an old problem.

{"answer": 2, "choices": ["was an Asian-American", "didn't perform as perfectly as the second one", "was untrustworthy", "showed no respect for authority"], "question": "As a manager, Tiffany is responsible for interviewing applicants for some of the positions with her company. During one interview, she noticed that the candidate never made direct eye contact. She was puzzled and somewhat disappointed because she liked the individual otherwise. He had a perfect resume and gave good responses to her questions, but the fact that he never looked her in the eye said \"untrustworthy,\" so she decided to offer the job to her second choice. \"It wasn't until I attended a diversity workshop that I realized the person we passed over was the perfect person.\" Tiffany admits. What she hadn't known at the time of the interview was that the candidate's \"different\" behavior was simply a cultural misunderstanding. He was an Asian-American raised in a family where respect for those in authority was shown by turning away your eyes. \"I was just thrown off by the lack of eye contact, not realizing it was cultural,\" Tiffany says. \"I missed out, but will not miss that opportunity again.\" Many of us have had similar experiences with behaviors we describe as different. As the world becomes smaller and our workplaces more diverse, it is becoming essential to expand our understanding of others and to reexamine some of our false assumptions   . Hire Advantage At a time when hiring qualified people is becoming more difficult, employers who can have no personal biases   from the process have an obvious advantage. My company, Mindsets LLC, helps organizations and individuals see their own blind spots. A real estate   agent we worked with illustrates the positive difference such training can make . \"During my Mindsets coaching period, I was taught how to own a diversified workforce. I employed people from different cultures and skill sets. The agents were able to make use of their full potential and experiences to build up the company. When the real estate market began to change, it was because we had a diverse agent pool that we were able to stay in the real estate market much longer than others in the same profession.\" Blinded by Gender Dale is an account executive who attended one of my workshops in charge of a diverse workforce. \"Through some of the lessons, I discovered my personal bias.\" he recalls. \"I learned I had not been looking at a person as a whole person, and being open to differences.\" In his case, the blindness was not about culture but rather gender. \"I had a management position open in my department; and the two finalists were a man and a woman. Had I not attended this workshop, I would have automatically assumed the man was the best candidate because the position required quite a bit of extensive travel. My assumption would have been that even though both candidates were great and could have been successful in the position, I assumed the woman would have wanted to be home with her children and not travel.\" Dale's assumptions are another example of the well-intentioned but incorrect thinking that limits an organization's ability to promote the full potential of a diverse workforce. \"I learned from the class that instead of forcing my gender biases into the situation, I needed to present the full range of duties, responsibilities and expectations to all candidates and allow them to make an informed decision.\" Dale sings high praise for the workshop, \"because it helped me make decisions based on fairness.\" A better Bottom Line An open mind about diversity not only improves organizations from inside, it is profitable as well. These comments from a customer service representative show how an inclusive attitude can improve sales.\" Most of my customers speak English as a second language. One of the best things my company has done is to contract with a language service that offers translations over the phone. It wasn't until my boss received Mindsets' training that she was able to understand how important inclusiveness was to customer service. As a result, our customer base has increased.\" Once we start to see people as individuals, we can move positively toward inclusiveness for everyone. Diversity is about coming together and taking advantage of our differences and similarities and about building better communities and organizations. When we begin to question our assumptions and challenge what we think we have learned from our past , from the media, peers, family, friends, etc, we begin to realize that some of our conclusions are imperfect or contrary to our fundamental values.

IKEA's name comes from Kamprad's initials (I.K.) and the place where he grew up ('E'and 'A').Today IKEA is known for its modern, minimalist furniture, but it was not a furniture company in the beginning.Rather, IKEA sold all kinds of miscellaneous goods. Kamprad's wares included anything that he could sell for profits at discounted prices, including watches, pens and stockings. IKEA first began to sell furniture through a mail-order catalogue in 1947.The furniture was all designed and made by manufacturers near Kamprad's home.Initial sales were very encouraging, so Kamprad expanded the product line.Furniture was such a successful aspect of the business that IKEA became solely a furniture company in 1951. In 1953 IKEA opened its first showroom in Almhult, Sweden.IKEA is known today for its spacious stores with furniture in attractive settings, but in the early1950s, people ordered from catalogues.Thus response to the first showroom was overwhelming: people loved being able to see and try the furniture before buying it.This led to increased sales and the company continued to thrive.By 1955, IKEA was designing all its own furniture. In 1956 Kamprad saw a man disassembling  a table to make it easier to transport.Kamprad was inspired.The man had given him a great idea: flat packaging.Flat packaging would mean lower shipping costs for IKEA and lower prices for customers.IKEA tried it and sales soared.The problem was that people had to assemble furniture themselves, but over time, even this grew into an advantage for IKEA.Nowadays, IKEA is often seen as having connotations  of self-sufficiency.This image has done wonders for the company, leading to better sales and continued expansion. Today there are over 200 stores in 32 countries.Amazingly, Ingvar Kamprad has managed to keep IKEA a privately-held company.In 2004 he was named the world's richest man.He currently lives in Switzerland and is retired from the day-to-day operations of IKEA.IKEA itself, though, just keeps on growing.

So the subject of your dream usually comes from something that has effect on you while you are sleeping(feeling of cold, a noise, a discomfort, etc.)and it may also use your past experiences and the wishes and the interests you have now. This is why children are likely to dream of fairies, older children of school examinations, hungry people of food, home-sick soldiers of their families and prisoners of freedom. To show you how this is happening while you are asleep and how your needs and wishes can all be joined together in a dream, here is the story of the experiment. A man was asleep and the back of his hand was rubbed with a piece of soft cotton. He would dream he was in hospital and his charming girlfriend was visiting him, sitting on the bed and feeling gently his hands!

In 1999, over 120 people came to help plant the first cover crop, which prepared the field for farming by adding nutrients to the soil.

{"answer": 1, "choices": ["Global warming caused penguins' death.", "Iceberg harmed penguins' life.", "Penguins need more habitats.", "Antarctic extreme weather caused penguins' death."], "question": "Most penguins died after a huge iceberg grounded near their habitat in Antarctica,forcing them to make a long way to find food, scientists say in a newly published study. The B09B iceberg, measuring about 100 square kilometers, grounded in Commonwealth Bay in East Antarctica in December 2010, the researchers from Australia and New Zealand wrote in the \"Antarctic Science\" journal. The Adelie penguin population at the bay's Cape Denison was measured to be about 160,000 in February 2011 but by December 2013 it had decreased to about 10,000, they said. The iceberg's grounding meant the penguins had to walk more than 60 kilometers to find food, preventing their breeding attempts, said the researchers from the University of New South Wales' ( UNSW) Climate Change Research Centre and New Zealand's West Penguin Trust. \"The Cape Denison population could disappear completely within 20 years unless B09B relocates or the fast ice within the bay breaks out,\"they wrote in the research published in. Fast ice is sea ice which forms and stays along the coast. During their survey in December 2013 , the researchers said \"hundreds of abandoned eggs were noted, and the freeze-dried dead bodies of previous season's little penguins lay everywhere on the ground.\" \"It's strangely silent,\"UNSW's Chris Turney , who led the 2013 exploration , told the\"Sydney Morning Herald Friday\".\"The ones that we saw at Cape Denison were terribly low-spirited , almost unaware of your existence . The ones that are surviving are clearly struggling. They can hardly survive themselves , let alone give birth to the next generation.

In 1849, Knight went to work in a cotton factory where she witnessed a \"shuttle,\" a device that carries thread back and forth across a textile loom , fly off the machine when the thread broke, striking and killing a young boy about her own age. The 12-year-old Knight developed a safety mechanism that made it impossible for a shuttle to leave the loom. The design was so effective, soon virtually every new power loom carried her invention, saving countless workers from injury or death. Being so young, she didn't bother to patent the device, so she never received payment. Knight wouldn't make the same mistake later in life when she invented a machine that could produce flat-bottomed paper bags. Knight had built a small wooden model in her home, but she needed a metal version to show it could hold up to the stress of mass production. So she hired Charles Annan to make the full-sized machine for her, only to have him try to claim the patent for himself. When Knight sued , Annan's argument was that the design had to be his, because no woman could possibly understand the complex mechanics. Knight proved him wrong when she brought back her wooden prototype and explained how every part worked. She won the case in 1871, making her the second woman to hold an American patent. Over a hundred years later, her design is still used as the basis for many modern flat-bottom bag machines. But that wasn't the last the world heard of Mattie Knight.

When I was young, I would turn around and around in the fields of wildflowers that grew in my backyard. Reality woke me up when I heard someone saying, \"I don't know why you bother trying to dance. Ballerinas are pretty and slender  girls. Besides, you don't have the talent to even be a ballerina.\" I remember how those words hurt every feeling in my body. I fell to the ground and wept for hours.   I enjoyed hanging out by the water. I would sit there for hours and stare at my reflection . There I was, looking nothing like a pretty ballerina dancer. Reflections don't lie. Once the waves would come, my reflection was washed away just like my dream to dance.  www.ks5u.com As I grew older, I began to realize that the reason my dream was even born was because it was something that was inside of me. The dream I had was never nurtured  and cared for, so it slowly died. It's not that I wanted it to die, but I allowed it to die the day I started listening to the words, \"You can't do it.\" When I finally woke up from many years of dreaming, I realized that you can't only settle for dancing in the wildflowers, you have to move on to the platform.

That's one possibility suggested in a new study which examined how conversation is related to happiness. Researchers, led by Matthias Mehl at the University of Arizona, looked at the different types of conversation that happy and unhappy people participate in. The study, published in the journal Psychological Science, was somewhat small, involving 79 undergraduates, but meshes   well with established ideas that happiness and social life are connected. Experts found that the happiest people in the study engaged in 33% more small talk than the unhappiest participants . Happy people tended to have twice as many deep conversations, and spent 25 percent less time alone than the unhappiest participants. These insights   fit with what psychologists have seen previously: that loneliness leads to depression  , and that feelings of social connectedness are important for happiness, said Susan Turk Charles, a psychologist at the University of California, who was not involved in the study. Deep conversations create a feeling of belonging that leads to happiness, she said. On the contrary, people who suffer from depression tend to withdraw from others. The method that the researchers used was creative, Charles said. Instead of bringing people into a lab, as is traditionally done in these sorts of studies, they had participants wear a recording device for four days, picking up conversations that they had. The recorder sampled   30 seconds of sound every 12.5 minutes, giving researchers a broad range of conversations to examine in terms of \"small talk\" vs. \"deep conversation\". The bottom line is that maintaining friendships can help with emotional well-being(,). Friends buffer the effects of negative events and provide support, Charles said. Don't be too busy to have a deep conversation, she said. \"It really is important. It should be something that you should pay just as much attention to as your career,\" she said.

That's one possibility suggested in a new study which examined how conversation is related to happiness. Researchers, led by Matthias Mehl at the University of Arizona, looked at the different types of conversation that happy and unhappy people participate in. The study, published in the journal Psychological Science, was somewhat small, involving 79 undergraduates, but meshes   well with established ideas that happiness and social life are connected. Experts found that the happiest people in the study engaged in 33% more small talk than the unhappiest participants . Happy people tended to have twice as many deep conversations, and spent 25 percent less time alone than the unhappiest participants. These insights   fit with what psychologists have seen previously: that loneliness leads to depression  , and that feelings of social connectedness are important for happiness, said Susan Turk Charles, a psychologist at the University of California, who was not involved in the study. Deep conversations create a feeling of belonging that leads to happiness, she said. On the contrary, people who suffer from depression tend to withdraw from others.

Today, millions of American children grow up without fathers. Too often, these children lack the love and help they badly need and which they would ordinarily receive from not one but two parents.

At present, however, nearly one half of all new marriages end in divorce, with often troubling results for their children. Worse, every year, thousands of teenage, unmarried Americans become mothers outside marriage, with generally terrible results for the mothers and children alike and for American society more generally. However, Chinese continue to value whole marriages. This is not to say that Chinese marriages are all perfect.

Obviously he was frozen, seemingly one of the homeless or someone like that. We joined the line and waited to be served. Ricky handed the server a twenty-dollar bill, ordered three cups of hot coffee, and gestured the sever to give one to the old gentleman outside on the bench as a favour. The server looked at Ricky, a little _ , without full comprehension of the request. Afterwards, there was a wonderful exchange between the server and the old man in need of some attention. I only wished I had taken a photo of the smiles on the both faces. As I was thinking about this event later on, I wondered to myself why Ricky didn't perform this act of kindness himself.

Some evidence suggests that the process was a gradual one in which the Colorado River (which runs through the canyon) slowly cut deeper and deeper into the ground over millions of years. But volcanic rock samples taken from the canyon now suggest that the canyon was down-cut instead. Down-cutting is when a flood of water rushes over a landscape   with enough force to cut deeply into the ground and leaves behind a canyon. Such a flood is usually released when a natural or man-made dam   bursts. Robert Webb, a research geologist, says natural dams seem to have formed and broken across the Colorado River several times during the last million years. The dams were built when lava  from the eruptions of nearby volcanoes flowed into the river. The lava hardened into hard rocks and blocked the river, causing it to back up and form a lake. Each time the lake grew so huge that it broke the rock dam, releasing a flash flood that furthered the down-cutting process and deepened the canyon. Down-cutting is not just an earthly event. Satellite photos sent back from Mars suggest that the process has happened there, too, say many other researchers. The photos, taken by the Mars Global Surveyor, indicate that an enormous lake existed on Mars 3.5 billion years ago. The lake spilled into a large nearby hole.

Egypt is ready to ditch Cairo and build a shiny new capital if the government has its way. Fed up with pollution, traffic jams, a packed population with soaring rents, Egypt is teaming up with a developer in the United Arab Emirates to build a city in what could be one of the world's most ambitious infrastructure programs. The yet-to-be-named city will spread out over 150 square miles, or roughly the size of Denver, and could eventually be home to 7 million people, the developers and government announced Friday. The current capital of Cairo, while full of history and vibrant charm, is home to more than 18 million people, and living in and getting around the city can be maddening and frustrating. The government says the idea is to reduce congestion in Cairo, which is projected to double in population in the coming decades. An exact location was not announced, but the city is expected to be built east of Cairo. It will be closer to the Red Sea -- between two major highways -- the Suez and the Ain Sokhna roads. The ambitions are big. In addition to the new embassies and government buildings, it plans to have an international airport bigger than Heathrow, solar energy farms, 40,000 hotel rooms, nearly 2,000 schools and 18 hospitals -- all linked together by over 6,000 miles of new roads.  _  The total cost is estimated at U.S. $45 billion, Minister of Housing Mostafa Madbouly announced at an economic development conference in Sharm el-Sheikh. The revealing of the new capital was paired with a glamorous website showing a luxurious and technological urban view of glass towers and pools. The plan is backed by a group that describes itself as \"a private real estate investment fund by global investors focused on investment and development partnerships\" led by Emirati developer Mohamed Alabbar. Alabbar made his name as the founder of Dubai's Emaar Properties, primarily known for developing the world's tallest building, the Burj Khalifa. Egypt is not the first country to plan on moving its capital from established big cities to rural greener pastures. Myanmar  has only recently completed its move from Yangon to the new city of Naypyidaw. Nigeria moved to Abuja in the 1990's, and Brazil carved its capital Brasilia out of the wilderness over 50 years ago. And then there was another crazy idea of building a capital city on a square of swampland that seemed mainly to be a boondoggle for wealthy land speculators  at the time. That city?  _ Egypt is ready to join hands with some experienced developers to build a new capital mainly because of the following EXCEPT   _   in the old capital.", "subject": ""}

Officials are using new observational technology to fight illegal fishing. \"Thank you for taking the time to join us here in Harwell (UK) in the Operations Center to what we call 'Project Eyes on the Seas.'\" says Tony Long, who leads the Ending Illegal Fishing program for Pew Charitable Trusts. The group created Project Eyes on the Seas.

The Pew team gives the information it gathers to port officials to help them decide if they should take action against a ship.

Calling is the first step where you can show your ability to an employer. Here are some tried and true tips: Get the person responsible You need to talk directly to the person who would supervise you. In a small business, you might ask to speak to the \"person in charge\". In a larger one, you would ask for the name of the person in charge of the particular department you're interested in. Get the name of the person If you don't have the name of the person you need to speak to, ask for it. Usually, you will be given the supervisor's name and your call will be transferred to him or her. Get past the receptionist In some cases, receptionists and secretaries will try to screen out your call. If they find out that you're looking for a job, they may transfer you to the Personnel Department or ask you to send an application or resume. Here are some ways to keep from getting screened out: * Call back Call back a day later and say you are getting ready to send some correspondence   to the person who manages such and such. You want to use the correct name and title and request that they give you this information. And this approach usually gets you what you need. Say \"thank you\" and call back in a day or so. Then ask for the supervisor or manager by name. * Call when the secretary is out You are likely to get right through if you call when the receptionist is out to lunch. Other good times are just before and after normal work hours. Less experienced staff members are likely to answer the phone and put you right through. Ask three times for an interview Sometimes, the supervisor you contact just simply rejects you. Then, you can try asking three times for an interview! Although this approach does not always work, asking the third time works more often than most people would believe.

Police say it may be weeks before the results of an autopsy   are known. Brian Dickson, 29, stood before the court in a wrinkled white shirt and blue jeans as a charge of first- degree murder was read out. He did not enter a plea. His case was held over until April 26. Dickson was arrested Wednesday. Police only announced his name and his age and asked the media not to publish any photos of Dickson, saying it could compromise the investigation.

Spielberg spent his early childhood in New Jersey and,later, Arizona. Some of his childhood memories became the inspiration for his filmmaking.  Even decades later, Spielberg says he has clear memories of his earliest years, which are the origins of some of his biggest hits. He believes that E.T.is the result of the difficult years leading up to his parent's 1966 divorce, \"It is really about a young boy who was in search of some stability in his life.\" \"He was scared of just about everything,\" recalls his mother, \"When trees brushed against the house,he would jump into my bed. And that's just the kind of scary stuff he would put in films like Poltergeist.\" To this day, Spielberg's wife, actress Kate Capshaw , says her husband remains terrified of airplanes.  Spielberg was 11 when he first got his hands on his dad's movie camera and began shooting short movies about World War II battles. These homemade movies gave him a way to escape his fears. From the very beginning, he had a creative imagination. With his talent for scary storytelling, he could terrify his three younger sisters. It also made it easier for him to make friends. On camping trips, when night fell,young Spielberg became the center of attention. He would start telling his ghost stories, and everyone would suddenly get quiet so that they could all hear it.  Spielberg moved to California with his father and went to high school there, but his grades were so bad that he hardly graduated. Both UCLA and USC film schools rejected him,so he entered California State University at Long Beach because it was close to Hollywood. Spielberg was determined to make movies,and he managed to get an unpaid,non-credit internship in Hollywood. Soon he was given a contract, and he dropped out of college. He never looked back.  Now,many years later, Spielberg is still telling stories with as much enthusiasm as when he was a boy. The author writes the text to   _  .", "subject": ""}

A small chip is implanted under the skin. It contains the medicine, which it releases at preset times. The developers say the device could improve the lives of millions of people who take medicine for long-term illnesses. A company called MicroCHIPS began developing the device about fifteen years ago. Last month, the company released the results of its first successful tests in humans. The tests took place in Denmark with seven women with osteoporosis.  Osteoporosis causes bones to become weak and break easily. The disorder is common among older people, especially women. Many patients have to give themselves daily injections of medicine. One type of treatment requires injections for two years. Robert farra is the president of MicroCHIPS.

The people are unfriendly, it's way too expensive, and the food is terrible - so why do so many tourists flock   there? London was named the world's most popular city between July and September 2013. It _ other world-famous cities such as New York and Paris, welcoming 4.9 million visitors, according to the UK Office for National Statistics. Amazingly, this was an increase of almost 19.5 percent on 2012 - the year when the Olympics happened in summer. So can London's success be explained? Well, maybe. As the English writer Samuel Johnson once said, \"when a man is tired of London, he is tired of life\". London life is often crazy and expensive, but if you can think of something, you can probably do it there. Anywhere in the city, you can often look around a great museum such as the British Museum, watch a concert at a historic venue   like the Royal Albert Hall, or dance the night away in a cool nightclub such as Fabric. And it's not just about culture - there are also world-famous sporting venues around the city. Many tourists like to watch soccer matches at stadiums such as Chelsea's Stamford Bridge, Arsenal's Emirates Stadium, or Tottenham's White Hart Lane. Tourists even came to watch British tennis player Andy Murray's famous victory at the Wimbledon tennis tournament   in 2013. Yes, but what about the food? Well, even if you don't like British food - and if you've never had real fish and chips, or a summer pudding, then perhaps you should wait until you've tried them - there is plenty of great food from all over the world available in London's many restaurants. London, like many of its buildings, has a long history, but also never lacks a vibrant pulse  .

There are about 1,000 hunting farms across America whose owners offer hunters an opportunity to kill animals that are kept in fenced areas. Russian boar, zebra, deer, antelope and many other species are raised just to be killed. Farm owners charge hunters thousands of dollars for animals that they kill, many of which are close to extinction  . The Humane Society of the United States says this type of hunting should be stopped because it is not fair to the animals. Many owners raise their animals. Others buy from animal dealers or from zoos and circuses that no longer want them. This means that the animals are not afraid of humans and they are easy to be shot by hunters. Owners of small ranches   keep their animals in fenced areas so that the hunters can get close to the animals before shooting at them. On large farms hunters are taken to areas where the animals are fed sometime of the day. This also makes it easy to kill the animals. The hunters want to keep the heads and chests of the animals they kill to hang as trophies   on their walls. This means that the animals are usually  shot in parts of the body. That means they will suffer a slow and painful death. The hunting is allowed across most of America but some parts of the country have stopped or restricted it.

Hide yourself away and spend your time reading, watching TV or walking around? You might think that feeling lonely is just like feeling happy, sad or scared - that it's just one of your various moods  . That is true. However, if you let yourself be lonely for too long without dealing with it, you could be making a serious mistake. Doctors have known for some time that feeling lonely is bad for the mind. It can lead to mental health problems such as depression ,stress and reduced confidence. \"Being lonely means not feeling connected or cared for, it's not about being physically alone,\" Lisa Jaremka, scientist from Ohio State University, US, told Live Science in January. But there's growing evidence that not having friends is connected with physical illness as well. In 2006, for example, scientists studied 2,800 women who had cancer. They found that those who had few friends or family were five times more likely to die of their disease than women with many social contacts. Also, even healthy people had a better chance of falling ill if they felt left out by others, according to the BBC. The results have scientists thinking that loneliness might hurt the immune system , which protects the body from diseases. Hoping to prove this theory, Jaremka and her research team put volunteers through a stress test. During the test, volunteers were asked to make an unprepared speech in front of a group of stony-faced people. The researchers found that volunteers who said they were lonely in their daily lives felt more stress during the test. And their blood samples showed that all the stress had managed to cause harmful changes to their immune system. \"Loneliness has been thought of in many ways as a chronic stressor --- a socially painful situation that can last for quite a long time,\" explained Jaremka, who led the study.

The study shows that not only do people use skin color to judge how healthy other individuals are, but they are accurate when they make those judgments. While this study focus on Caucasian faces, it suggests this phenomenon may exist across cultures, since similar preferences for skin yellowness are found in an African population.

{"answer": 3, "choices": ["The amount of wealth", "The amount of money", "The social status", "The way of getting money"], "question": "In the eighteenth century one of the first modern economists, Adam Smith, thought that \" the whole annual produce of the land and labour of every country\" provided revenue to \"three different orders of people: those who live by rent, those who live by wages, and those who live by profit\". Each successive stage of the industrial revolution, however, made the social structure more complicated. Many intermediate groups grew up during the nineteenth century between the upper middle class and the working class. There were small-scale industrialists as well as large ones, small shopkeepers and tradesmen, officials and salaried employees, skilled and unskilled workers, and professional men such as doctors and teachers. Farmers and peasants continued in all countries as independent groups. During the nineteenth and early twentieth centuries the possession of wealth inevitably affected a person's social position. Intelligent industrialists with initiative made fortunes by their wits which lifted them into an economic group far higher than that of their working-class parents. But they lacked social training of the upper class, who despised them as the \"new rich.\" They often sent their sons and daughters to special schools to acquire social training. Here their children, mixed with the children of the upper classes, were accepted by them, and very often found marriage partners from among them. In the same way, a thrifty, hardworking labourer, though not clever himself, might save for his son enough to pay for an extended secondary school education in the hope that he would move in a \"white-collar\" occupation, carrying with it a higher salary and a move up in the social scale. In the twentieth century the increased taxation of higher incomes, the growth of the social services, and the wider development of educational opportunity have considerably altered the social outlook.

The police asked Fisher for help because of his rich knowledge in cognitive  interview, a kind of memory - rebuilding process.Memory researchers have found that people trying to remember a past event often only recall part of the relevant information.Human memory is selective and it is often _ by stress.But a person's accurate recall of an event or understanding of a question can be improved using specific interviewing techniques.The \"cognitive interview\" was developed in the late 1990s.It encourages the witness to take an active role in recalling information rather than giving answers only to someone else's questions.The witness first describes what happened in his or her own words, with no interviewer interruptions.The interviewer then goes further with specific techniques, such as having the witness tell the details of what happened from different perspectives   . The cognitive interview focuses on guiding witnesses through four general recalling techniques: thinking about physical surroundings and personal feelings that existed at the time of past events; reporting everything that connects to mind about those events, no matter how broken it is retelling events in a variety of time orders, such as from beginning to end, end to beginning, forward or backward; and adopting different perspectives while recalling events.

Apple's products are the envy of the world. They have been spectacularly successful and are widely imitated, if not copied. The minute Apple crystallizes a product, everyone knows how to compete. This idea that the basis of competition is set by Apple and then the race is on to climb the path of improvement is unquestionable. When Apple releases a product that defines a category or dramatically changes the structure of an industry, it becomes obvious what needs to be built. But what I wonder is why everyone wants to copy Apple's products but nobody wants to copy being Apple? I can think of two reasons. Firstly, Apple is not worth copying because it's not successful; secondly, Apple's success cannot be copied because it is a magical process.

Why should one bother copying Apple if it results in being punished with a low valuation?

A growing body of research suggests that starting high school later improves attendance,achievements and grades.A few years ago in an important study ,test scores on the SAT college entrance exams in Edina,Minnesota jumped more than 100 points on average,when the morning school bell rang an hour later.Unfortunately,most schools are not set up to start later and fail to satisfy teen's sleep needs.

Really. They're quite small and have no opening to the outside world carrying sound through the body. For the past seven years, Simon Thorrold, a university professor, has been examining fish ears, small round ear bones called otoliths. As fish grow, so do their otoliths. Each day, their otoliths gain a ring of calcium carbonate  . By looking through a microscope and counting these rings, Thorrold can determine the exact age of a young fish. As a fish gets older, its otoliths no longer get daily rings. Instead, they get yearly rings, which can also be counted, giving information about the fish's age, just like the growth rings of a tree. Ring counting is nothing new to fish scientists. But Thorrold has turned to a new direction. They're examining the chemical elements   of each otolith ring. The daily ring gives us the time, but chemistry tells us about the environment in which the fish swam on any given day. These elements tell us about the chemistry of the water that the fish was in. It also says something about water temperature, which determines how much of these elements will gather within each otolith ring. Thorrold can tell, for example, if a fish spent time in the open ocean before entering the less salty water of coastal areas. He can basically tell where fish are spending their time at any given stage of history. In the case of the Atlantic croaker, a popular saltwater food fish, Thorrold and his assistant have successfully followed the travelling of young fish from mid-ocean to the coast, a journey of many hundreds of miles.

{"answer": 2, "choices": ["Social news", "Community activities", "Science", "Children s life"], "question": "Scientists are not sure how the brain follows the tracks of time.One theory holds that it has a group of cells specialized to record the intervals  of time, while another theory holds that some neural processes  act as an inside clock. Whichever theory it may be, studies find, the cells have a poor grasp of longer interval.Time does seem to slow during an empty afternoon and race when the brain focuses on challenging work.Stimulants  , including caffeine, tend to make people feel as if.time is passing faster; complex jobs, like doing taxes, can seem to drag on longer than they actually do.And  emotional  events -- a breakup, a promotion, a transformative trip abroad --tend to be sensed as more recent than they actually are, by months or even years.In short, some psychologists say, the findings support the philosopher Martin Heidegger' s observation that time \"persists merely as a consequence of the events taking place in it.\" Now researchers are finding that the opposite thing may also be true: if very few events come to mind, then the sense of time does not persist; the brain shortens the interval that has passed. In one classic experiment, a French explorer named Michel Siffre lived in a cave for two months, cut off from the rhythms of night and day and man-made clocks.He appeared then, convinced that he had been isolated for only 25 days.Left to its own devices, the brain tends to shorten time. In earlier work, researchers found  that a similar case at work in people's judgment of intervals that last only moments.Relatively infrequent stimuli, like flashes or tones, tend to increase the speed of the brain' s internal pacemaker. On an obvious level, these kinds of findings offer an explanation for why other people' s children seem to grow up so much faster than one's own.Involved parents are all too well aware of first step in their own children; however, seeing a cousin's child once every few years, without bothering memories, shortens the time.

It is a call for every American to pay attention to the destruction we risk by allowing human-induced  climate change to continue. It is impossible to prove that Hurricane Katrina was caused by global warming, or even that human activities made the storm more severe. However, a paper published in the scholarly journal Nature reports that the force of dangerous hurricanes has increased by 50% during the last 50 years. It also reports that a global warming-induced rise in temperature near the ocean's surface has probably contributed to this increase in dangerous storms, and thus to property  damage and human death. On August 30, the Los Angeles Times summed up  the view of many scientists who agree that if the frequency of hurricanes does not decrease in the next few years, then we will be fairly certain that humans, and not natural storm cycle, are at the root of the problem. I believe there is at least a chance that by reducing U.S. reliance on fossil fuels for energy, we can prevent future tragedies like Hurricane Katrina. Let the change begin now. There are many ways to reduce the volume of greenhouse gas emissions. My family drives the most fuel-efficient car we can afford, but I prefer to take public transportation whenever possible. My family buys locally grown food instead of produce that was transported thousands of miles on fuel-burning vehicles. We also replaced our incandescent light bulbs with more energy-efficient compact fluorescents .

The waves were predicted as part of Einstein's general theory of relativity nearly 100 years ago. It was the theory of the physics behind the workings of our world and the universe. The idea was that the waves are like ripples in space, caused by some of the violent and energetic processes in the universe. For example, two black holes crashing into each other. Now a group of scientists, including ones from Caltech, MIT and the LIGO Scientific, Collaboration finally found the gravitational waves. David Reitze is the executive director of the LIGO observatory at Caltech. \"We have detected gravitational waves. We did it!\" What are these gravitational waves? Well, imagine throwing a rock into a pond. When the rock hits the flat surface of the water, it creates ripples or waves. Space-time is like the surface of the water. So that means gravitational waves are like the ripples moving out from where the rock hits the water. It might be hard to understand, but those gravitational waves expand and contract space and time as they move through space. And when they get to the Earth, the waves pass through, and they contract and expand the planet as the waves go by. It was Einstein who said these gravitational waves should be observable. But these are not huge waves. They are very, very small, which is why it took so long to find them. You cannot see them with your eyes. They are smaller than the size of an atom. How did the scientists find them? They used a giant scientific tool called LIGO, which stands for the Laser Interferometer Gravitational-Wave Observatory. The billion-dollar LIGO project is two L-shaped observatories. One is in Louisiana and the other in Washington state. For years, scientists have been watching two black holes in another faraway galaxy. The two were spinning around each other, moving closer and closer together. When they finally crashed into each other, it was with such power and force that gravitational waves rang throughout the universe, like a giant bell.

Once lighthouses had telephones, keepers would call each other to warn that the inspector was approaching.

Eventually they boiled the leaves, put some of them on a piece of bacon for dinner, ate the leaves, and threw the tea soup away.

The first pot was warmed by the hostess from a second pot (usually silver) that was kept heated over a small flame.

We gave Lemon-Aide to Lesa and told her he was to go with her to all of her treatments to remind her that we were thinking of her and caring about her even though we could not always be with her. When the treatments were completed, she said when someone else needed him she would pass him along. A few months later,much to my surprise, it was me that she passed him to. Lemon-Aide went with me to all of my treatments. One day while waiting for my doctor I decided we could market the idea to fight cancer. Lesa thought it was a great idea so we founded the organization that came to be known as Lemon-Aide' s Friends, Inc. We designed our organization to remind people fighting cancer that there are people who love and care about them all the time. Today we have totally 5013 volunteers. The money raised is donated to cancer patients who do not have insurance. The physicians on our Board of Advisors determine how and where our money is donated. Lemon-Aide is for men, women, and children of all ages and to date has been sent to 34 states and 33 countries to provide smiling support for people fighting cancer.

People who drank mostly fruit juice instead of sodas did not have the same risk, the study of 60,000 people in Singapore found. \"Sugar may be to blame but people who drink sweetened sodas regularly often have other poor health habits,\" said Mark Pereira of the University of Minnesota, who led the study. \"The high levels of sugar in soft drinks may be increasing the level of insulin  in the body, which we think contributes to pancreatic cancer cell growth,\" President said in a statement. Writing in the journal Cancer Epidemiology, Biomarkers & Prevention, Pereira and his colleagues said they followed 60,524 men and women in the Singapore--Chinese Health Study for 14 years. Over that time, 140 of the volunteers developed pancreatic cancer. Those who drank two or more sweetened soft drinks a week had an 87 percent higher risk of being among those who got pancreatic cancer. Pereira said he believed the findings would apply elsewhere. \"Singapore is a wealthy country with excellent healthcare. Favorite pastimes  are eating and shopping, so the findings should apply to other western countries.\" he said. But Susan Mayne of the Yale Cancer Center at Yale University in Connecticut was cautious. \"Although this study found a risk, the finding was based on a relatively small number of cases and it remains unclear whether it was a causal  connection or not.\" Said Mayne, who serves on thee board of the journal, which is published by the American Association for Cancer Research.

Bicycling in traffic is considered by many to be reckless and sometimes rude.

Another popular idea is that cyclists should stay as close to the edge of the road as possible in order to stay out of the way of cars. Getting in the way of cars is considered to be an invitation to death, because car drivers are often expected to run into anything that is slower or more vulnerable. Going together with motor traffic used to be regarded as a nice idea for cyclists, but today it is thought to be suicide. Roads are believed to be designed for cars and not for bicycles. Inferior bicycles may hold that they have the right to use the road, but they had better stay out of the way of superior users or they will be \"dead right\".

Someday, you'll at least be able to send their odors . A Paris lab under the direction of David Edwards, Michigan Technological University alumnus, has created the oPhone, which will allow odors to be sent, by Bluetooth and smart phone attachments, to oPhones across the state, country or ocean, where the person who receive it can enjoy American Beauties or any other kinds of rose. It can be sent by email, tweet, or text. Edwards says the idea started with student designers in his class at Harvard, where he is a professor.    Normally, he says, there's a clear end in sight, but with their project no one had a clue  who was going to pay for the research or if there was even a market. With the early major buzz  produced -- Wired Magazine, National Public Radio, and the British press -- Edwards is sure the market will come.     \"We create odor profiles ,\" says Blake Armstrong, director of business communications at Vapor Communications, an organization operating out of Le Lab in Paris. \"We put that into the oChip that gives away that smell.\"     Edwards said that the original four chips that will come with the first oPhones can be combined  into thousands of different odors -- produced for 20 to 30 seconds.     In fact, Le Lab is working with Cafe Coutume, the premier coffee shop in Paris, using oPhones to create nice experiences.     \"Imagine you are online and want to know what a particular brand of coffee would smell like,\" Edwards says. \"Or, you are in an actual long line waiting to order. You just tap on the oPhone and get the experience.\"     And there are other benefits. \"Fragrance houses, of course, culinary, travel, but also healthcare. \"A patient with brain damage had lost memory, and the oPhone can help bring that memory back.

The impact it makes upon you is huge and life is never quite the same again. My first whale was a 40ft grey, off the coast of California in 1979, and I've been a whale addict ever since. Now I have to go whale watching regularly just to survive normal daily life. I may be crazy but I am certainly not alone. The world is filled with whale watchers: since its beginnings in the mid-fifties, whale watching has grown dramatically and now more than 13 million people join organized whale watching trips every year. As a faithful whale watcher, all your holidays center on whales. The only books you read are ones about whales; you wear whale T-shirts, and every time you meet your friends you talk about whales. So what is it about these larger-than-life animals that makes them so special? Their enormous size is one possible explanation: imagine sitting in a small boat next to a blue whale almost as long as a Boeing 737.The fact that we know so little about them is another possibility: modern technology has taken us to the moon and beyond, yet we are only just beginning to understand these extraordinary forms of intelligent life on our own planet. Planning and patience are just two essential requirements for successful whale watching. Planning is needed because there are certain whale hot spots--where you have the best chance of seeing them--and because the larger species tend to be on their way from feeding areas to breeding grounds, so rarely do they stay in one place for more than a few months at a time. Patience is necessary because, even under the best conditions, whales can be tricky to find.

Negativity that comes from complaining kills creativity and innovation  . Habitual complainers are less likely to come up with new ideas, as they are busy finding faults and discourage others from trying new things by making them feel that they won't work. When you spend time with people who constantly complain, you are likely to view things in a negative light. This will make things worse.

Like coral pounded by the sea, we grow.Physical demands can cause us to grow stronger.Mental and emotional stress can produce tough-mindedness and resiliency.Spiritual testing can produce strength of character and faithfulness.So, you have problems? No problem! Just tell yourself, \"There I grow again!\" Remember: A smooth sea never made a skilled mariner. After reading this passage, we should   _  .", "subject": ""}

Use More Facial Expression One psychologist feels that our facial expression is responsible more than anything else for the impression others have of us. In fact, more than 50 percent of another's impression, he believes, is influenced by the look on your face. Naturally a smile in which the eyes participate is extremely communicative. An unfriendly look often brings the same thing in return. People tend to mirror your expression, so try to show how you feel about a topic or an idea or the audience through your facial expression. 2. Rid Your Inner Fear It's natural to have some tension or nervousness when you appear before an audience. The way to handle it is to put it to work for you, get into action, as Shakespeare observed, action cures fear. There are only a few known ways to control fear. The first is to admit it, do the thing you fear and it will be the death of fear itself. Another simple aid at the last minute before you begin, is to take a few deep breaths, this will help get the butterflies in formation and also keep your voice under control. In fact, if you're thoroughly prepared, just taking a few deep breaths before you're introduced will give you added confidence and balance. Other known ways to control nervousness and fear are to give yourself an encouraging talk or take some physical exercise. 3. Polish Your Voice Our voice is the main instrument we possess for communicating with people, we're all sound sensitive. So invest in a tape recorder, practise your speech by speaking it into the microphone then listen to it. You can even have others join in the evaluation of your strong points and your weaknesses or faults as well. Remember that Demosthenes and Winston Churchill both used pebbles in their mouths while practising their speaking. Simply reading out loud can also help you improve your voice and develop a personal style. 4. Strengthen Your Memory Psychologists tell us that most individuals don't use above ten percent of their natural capacity for memory, that's comparable to trying to run a car on one cylinder . Why do most people use so little of their power of memory? Because they don't practise the fundamentals of remembering. First and most important, it's necessary to have a burning desire to remember, it's difficult to recall anything without wanting to do so. Step number two is concentration.

And one day, at the station, she saw dozens of children who spent their days begging from train passengers rather than going to school. She learned that it was not a rare problem and that millions of children in India lived on the streets. Realizing that these children would never be able to escape poor life and homelessness without education, and that it would be impossible to send these children to school, Inderjit decided to create a model program---taking the school to the most out- of-school children. Khurana's train platform schools aim to provide a creative school form and give children the basic levels of education. Her last goals reach far beyond the 20 platform schools she and her colleagues have created in India's Bhubaneswar region. She is determined that her program will become a model for changing the lives of the poorest children throughout India and the world. Khurana founded the Ruchika Social Service Organization(RSSO) in 1985. The teachers gather the children together between the stops of the train for reading, writing, maths and history taught through songs and other teaching tools. Khurana recently comes to realize that the education of these children is impossible when the most basic needs of their families are not being met.

What if the person appears to be nervous? Is the person unable to look me in the eye? Is he or she look around the room? What about other nervous movements, such as fidgeting or shifting from side to side? Many people--from parents to police officers and airport security personnel--depend on this method. But does a person's body and face reveal the truth? Not according to a new study. Talking, it seems, is the best way to smoke out a liar. That is what researchers in the United Kingdom found out recently. Their investigation took place at one place where lying can get you into big trouble--an airport. The researchers asked volunteers to pretend they were real passengers and then lie to airport security agents. Some of the agents used spoke conversation-based methods to question these make-believe passengers. Others depended instead on the person's body language, like lack of eye contact and showing signs of nervousness. The agents talking with the passengers were 20 times more likely to catch the liars. The study found that these conversation-based techniques can help you recognize when a person is lying to you. Like many methods, this conversation method has a name. It is called Controlled Cognitive Engagement or CCE, for short. The British government partly financed this study. The American Psychological (APA) published the findings. Body language cannot be trusted. Using body language and facial expressions to catch someone in a lie is really hard. And it only works, seemingly, by chance.

According to the Beijing-based Capital Medical University, the number of depression patients has been on the rise in the past years and now accounts for 5 to 10 percent of the population, more than the global average of 5 percent. Wang Shaoli, vice-president of Beijing Huilongguan Hospital, a medical center specializing in mental health, said that what makes depression so widespread is that everybody can get it. \"No one is immune to depression,\" said Wang. \"It has become a social problem because depression kills one's social capabilities, such as communication, and leads to a negative social mentality.\" According to Wang, depression can be treated with medicine and early psychological consultation. The real problem is the lack of awareness surrounding the issue. \"People with mental health illnesses are discriminated against,\" said Wang. \"So they are reluctant to go to hospital and often keep the pain to themselves, which only makes matters worse.\" Only one in 10 depression victims are properly treated in China, according to the Beijing Suicide Research and Prevention Center. \"When people get depressed, it becomes part of their thoughts, making them negative, even desperate,\" said Wang. \"And the ideas are difficult to change.\" That's why Wang suggests early intervention. \"Normally it takes about nine months to treat depression,\" said Wang. \"But in most cases, patients drop treatment half way when they feel some progress.\" How is Para1& 2 mainly supported when it tells that depression has become a social problem?", "subject": ""}

{"answer": 0, "choices": ["suffer from loneliness and anxiety", "play endless online games", "cause adoption of self-destruction", "worry about life's pressures"], "question": "Being lonely in the crowd might seem ridiculous. But according to a recent survey, the situation is all too common. Loneliness and other anxiety problems - worrying about life's pressures - can even lead to self-murder.          An article in China Daily gave no reason for this other than the usual blaming of the post-80s generation. According to a high level official, young people suffering from discouragement are mostly \"spoiled and have not been taught to be independent, responsible and express 'thank-you'.\" Well, how do you like that? First, I don't think China's youth are exactly spoiled. They certainly have more things than their parents did, but a lot of the money spent on them is for their education including various extra classes.          Discouragement and anxiety are now the fastest growing challenges in modern societies. We sense a lack of close friends who can talk to honestly and openly. In 1985, a US study found that one in ten people did not have such a friend. In 2006, it was one in four. It's easy to see the connection between loneliness and discouragement. But what actually causes this increasing loneliness?          Surely, with Internet social networking sites such as Kaixin, we have more friends than ever. A new study has shown that the more time teenagers spend in front of computers, the less close they are to friends and family.Kaixinor QQ may be fun but it lacks meaning, compared to personal connections in the real world.          And then there are those endless online games popular with young Chinese but increasingly there are more interesting choices.

First, I don't think China's youth are exactly spoiled. They certainly have more things than their parents did, but a lot of the money spent on them is for their education including various extra classes.          Discouragement and anxiety are now the fastest growing challenges in modern societies. We sense a lack of close friends who can talk to honestly and openly. In 1985, a US study found that one in ten people did not have such a friend. In 2006, it was one in four. It's easy to see the connection between loneliness and discouragement.

In almost every culture in the world, mothers are thought to be more important than fathers during children's development and more likely to build strong bonds with their children. This belief had existed for a long time until scientists started asking a new question: What do fathers contribute to their children besides their genes? They must mean something, or they would have disappeared from children's lives at an earlier time in evolution . So, a new science of fatherhood was born. American journalist Paul Raeburn collected the discoveries over the years and put them into his new book, Do Fathers Matter? What Science Is Telling Us About the Parent We've Overlooked, hoping to make people better see the many ways that fathers influence their children. For example, Ronald Preston Rohner, a scientist at the University of Connecticut, US, spent several years studying how being accepted or rejected by parents influences children's personality. He found that children who are accepted by both their parents are usually independent and hold a positive worldview while those who feel turned down by either parent may turn out hostile and negative. Melanie Horn-Mallers, a psychologist at California State University, found that sons who have happy memories of their fathers are better able to handle day-to-day stress after growing up. Another study, by Richard Koestner at McGill University, Canada, focused on how children develop empathy . After looking at various possible factors, Koestner found one to be more important than others -- how much time their fathers spend with them. \"We were amazed to find that how affectionate parents were with their children didn't matter much to the development of empathy,\" said Koestner. \"And we were astounded at how strong the father's influence was.\" Indeed, evidence shows that fathers make unique contributions to their children's happiness. However, that doesn't mean that children in families without fathers are definitely going to become failures. Just look at US President Barack Obama.

The official record certificate was presented by Guinness World Records, Global Managing Director, Mr. Alistair Richards to CCTV Vice President Mr. Luo Ming during a special \"China in Cannes\" reception co-hosted with Reed MIDEM as part of the celebrations to honor the Chinese delegation at this year's MIPTV market. CSM Media Research, which supplied the viewing figures for Guinness World Records verification , considered viewers aged 4 years or above who watched at least one minute of the 2012 show on either CCTV-1, 3 or 4, the three channels which aired the show at the same time. The figure refers to viewers on any one of the three channels, therefore excluding duplications . This represents almost 40% of the China TV population aged 4 years or above. Commenting on CCTV's incredible record achievement which is based on reach of audience, Alistair Richards said, \"It is fitting that we celebratethis amazing achievement at MIPTV. National networks have the power to move nations and CCTV's Spring Festival Gala is the ultimate example. It reaches nearly half a billion people on the biggest holiday of their year.\" CCTV Vice President Luo Ming, who accepted the Guinness World Records certificate on behalf of CCTV, said, \"Chinese New Year is a special time for families in China and our Spring Festival Gala has been the traditional TV entertainment highlight for three decades. Although this is a world record achieved by our viewers, it is also a record won by the staff of CCTV, who makes it possible for our television shows to reach homes right across China.\" The new record will be included in the next edition of the world famous Guinness World Records book.

But saying \"I'm sorry\" comes more easily for some people than doing that for others. A new study suggests that specific personality traits offer clues about whether a person is likely to offer a sincere apology.  Psychologist Andrew Howell and his colleagues at Grant MacEwan University in Edmonton designed a questionnaire to measure a person's willingness to beg someone's pardon. They asked participants to indicate their level of agreement with a series of statements, such as \"My continued anger often gets in the way of me apologizing\" or \"If I think no one will know what I have done, I am not likely to apologize.\" The researchers then used the answers to determine every participant's \"proclivity  to apologize,\" and they cross-referenced  these scores with results from a variety of personality assessments. From the beginning, Howell was confident that people with high marks on compassion and agreeability would be willing apologizers -- and the study results confirmed his hypothesis . But the experiment also turned up some surprising traits of the unrepentant . People with low self-esteem, for example, were less inclined to apologize, even though they probably feel bad after a conflict. Unlike people who experience guilt about a specific action and feel sorry for the person they have wronged, individuals who experience generalized shame may actually be feeling sorry for themselves. In contrast, \"people who are sure of themselves have the capacity to confess to wrongdoing and admit it,\" Howell suggests. But just the right amount of self-esteem is the key. The study also found that narcissists -- people who, in Howell's words, \"are very egocentric, with an overly grand view of themselves\" -- were reluctant to offer an apology.

It can uncover laws of nature, cure diseases, make bombs, and help bridges to stand up. Indeed science is so good at what it does that there's always a temptation  to drag it into problems where it may not be helpful. David Brooks, author of The Social Animal: The Hidden Sources of Love, Character, and Achievement, appears to be the latest in a long line of writers who have failed to go against the temptation. Brooks gained fame for several books. His latest book The Social Animal, however, is more ambitious and serious than his earlier books. It is an attempt to deal with a set of weighty topics. The book focuses on big questions: What has science uncovered about human nature? What are the sources of character? And why are some people happy and successful while others aren't? To answer these questions, Brooks studies a wide range of disciplines . Considering this, you might expect the book to be a simple description of facts. But Brooks has formed his book in an unusual, and perhaps unfortunate way. Instead of introducing scientific theories, he tells a story, within which he tries to make his points, perhaps in order to keep the reader's attention. So as Harold and Erica, the hero and heroine in his story, live through childhood, we hear about the science of child development and as they begin to date we hear about the theory of sexual attraction. Brooks carries this through to the death of one of his characters. On the whole, Brooks' story is acceptable if uninspired.

The phenomenon caught a lot of attention of some experts and Leshan citizens. On August 3, Professor Wang Sichao from the Purple Mountain Observatory of the Chinese Academy of Sciences said, the objects still need to be identified. Luckily, Lu Shan took some photos of it. He described, the objects first lit up the sky in the west, but lasted for about 10 minutes. Then they moved slowly at a speed of I meter per minute to the north, and became smaller and smaller until they disappeared. \"It was like a sunset before they faded, and their light also became so gentle as the sunset.\" Some citizens doubted they were UFOs, but Lu Shan thought it was possibly caused by the refraction  of the sunlight. However, Lu found no scientific proof to support this special phenomenon after comparing with his photos. According to Professor Wang Sichao, it could be the \"sun dog \" which is an atmospheric phenomenon that creates bright spots of light in the sky, often in a bright ring or  _ on either side of the sun. But he also added the sky above Leshan city that night did not satisfy the conditions to have \"sun dog\". \"Sun dog\" usually happens in cold areas, such as the north and south poles of the earth. \"So this phenomenon was strange,\" said Wang Sichao.

Nearly 1, 500 fossils were recovered from the dusty canyon. The remains are about 1.4 million years old. They include the bones of a new species of deer, several small rodents   and more. A giant cat fossil was also found. Scientists believe the animal was an ancestor of the saber- toothed tiger. Signs of plant life were uncovered as well. \"This is a huge find,\" says Rick Greenwood, a scientist studying the site. \"I don't think most people had any idea that those types of animals were wandering around here more than a million years ago.\" San Timoteo Canyon is located about 85 miles from Los Angeles. The area of the canyon where the fossils were found was once part of a green river valley. Today, the region is dry and plant life is rare. Most of the fossils are well preserved. Experts say a muddy lake bed may have trapped thirty animals that wandered over for a drink. The mud helped to protect the animal fossils. The remains are a million years older than those discovered at the famous La Brea Tar Pits in Los Angeles. Scientists studying the bones will be able to learn more about how the animals adapted to changes in the environment. \"We have a confused view of what this time period was like, \" says another scientist. \"A discovery like this could really be an important contribution.\" About 35 different animal species are represented in the fossil collection.

In the United States, a request has been made to extend the protections of the Endangered Species Act to marine species including the clownfish. But before you start shedding tears for Nemo and his buddies, keep in mind that this request is not based on any evidence of a decline in the clownfish population. Instead, what has sparked concern is the worsening health of coral reefs, which more than one million aquatic species including the clownfish depend on to thrive, even survive.  In ways it makes more sense to move to protect a species when its habitat declines rather than its actual population. The most important mission of the Endangered Species Act is the protection of species' habitats; without their habitats, there's almost no hope of saving endangered animals, except perhaps in a zoo.    Earlier this year, alarming news came about the world's largest coral reef system, Australia's Great Barrier Reef (GBR,). A study has shown the Reef is in sharp decline, with half of its coral cover gone in the past 27 years.      Katharina Fabricius, an Australian coral reef ecologist co-authoring the study, has been diving and working on the GBR since 1988--and has watched the decline. \"There are still a lot of fish ... but not the same color1 and diversity as in the past,\" she said.    The study team used information from more than 2,000 surveys to determine the rate of decline between 1985 and 2012. That overall 50-percent decline, they estimate, is a yearly loss of about 3.4 percent of the Reef. If the trend continued, the coral cover could halve again by 2022.     Several main factors are responsible for the decline, the study found. Intense tropical cyclones  , believed to be fueled by global warming, have caused massive damage to reefs in the central and southern parts of the Reef.

Some accidents and illnesses are serious and may result in long periods of invalidism. The newspapers contain spectacular accounts of accidents in the street and highways and public places, but nearly as many accidents occur around the home. Somebody trips on a rug. Somebody falls off a stepladder. Somebody is careless in cooking dinner, and is burned. Accidents incurred in the playing of sports and swimming also accounts for a large number of injuries, big and little. Despite constant campaigns to reduce the number of accidents, there are still approximately 100,000 accidental deaths and nearly 9,000,000 nonfatal injuries in the United States each year. It has been estimated that around 3,000,000 people are constantly ill in the United States throughout the year and that over half the illness is caused by respiratory diseases, chiefly colds and influenza. The pain and suffering caused by accidents and illness tell only half the story. Loss of time from school and work and medical and hospital expenses often make the pain seem worse. Money spent in this country for doctors, services, hospitalization, nursing care, drugs, medicines, Xrays, and special treatments, amounts to a huge annual sum. Added to this expense is another much larger amount that is lost to wage earners throughout the nation by reason of their loss of wages or income while sick or otherwise disabled. Accident and health insurance is a form of insurance devised to protect against these economic losses. It protects the earning of wage earners and finishes financial aid to the family of the breadwinner by the payment of his doctor and hospital bills. Today, business and professional men, farmers, industrial workers, clerks and those engaged in various occupations, whose earning power is shut off for a week, a month, or sometimes years, because of accidents or illness can insure themselves against this financial loss by accident and health insurance.

Policy is another name for an insurance contract . Most accident and health policies are cancelable policies--that is, they are sold for a definite term such as a week, a month, or a year, similar to contracts of fire insurance and automobile liability insurance.

The project is promoted by an environmental protection organisation,which has contributed to improving the living environment for wild animals. Recently, the organisation has issued an appeal to help it observe environmental changes based on the record of butterflies and protect the environment. In the area, the local people have planted many special flowers with the help of the organisation, aiming to see whether these flowers will interest the rare and beautiful butterflies. The Project officer Sarah Marshall says, \"It will be a suitable habitat for butterflies. They are great 'indicator species' as they are easily affected by climate changes so they make a brillian early - warning system for the environment.\" She also points out that volunteers are needed to recourd the number or species of butterflies,and based on the change happening to the butterflies, the hidden environmental problems in the area can be found out in time. The organisation is seeking volunteers to help monitor butterflies from April through to September. They will walk a fixed route and record the different butterflies they encounter along the way.Each visit should take no more than two hours, and each volunteer is expected to visit once a month to count the wildlife. \"Staff will provide back up, so if the weather is poor on the day you are to visit(butterflies don't like to fly in the rain, wind or if it's too cloudy) we can have someone else do your job,\" Sarah points out.

There was a guest speaker there that day talking to us about praying   for our enemies. I began to think about this. As I considered the idea, I prayed and asked God how I could pray for the kids in my class. I had forgotten that they weren't bad kids; they were just lost. At first, the prayers were mechanical. When I would hear their voices in class, I would pray, \"Dear God, please bless soandso...\" But as I continued, I began to think of the kids more often, and in my quiet time at home I would ask God to bless   the rest of my classmates. As time went on, my classmates became more than just annoying kids to me. There was something growing inside my heart for them, something that wasn't there before.

{"answer": 0, "choices": ["take the function of bonuses for granted", "see that bonus offering is done everywhere", "think financial encouragement is disgusting", "are shocked by the practice of rewarding for failures"], "question": "Bonus  culture has become the subject of many studies nowadays. Many people have been angered by the way some bankers and high officials seem to have been rewarded for failure. Others find the idea of offering many-million-dollar bonuses morally disgusting. But few have asked whether performance-related bonuses really do improve performance. The answer seems so obvious that even to ask the question can appear ridiculous. Indeed, in spite of all the complaints about them, financial encouragements continue to be introduced in more and more areas, from healthcare and public services to teaching and universities. So it may come as a shock to many to learn that paying for results can actually make people perform badly in many circumstances, and that the more you pay, the worse they perform. No one is arguing that bonuses can help companies and institutions attract and keep the best staff. Nor does anyone argue against the idea that you can encourage people to do specific tasks by linking payments to those tasks. Rather, the point is about how to get the best out of people. Do employees really perform better if you promise to pay them more for getting results? There are some obvious reasons why such payments can fail. It has been argued, for instance, that cash bonuses contributed to the financial crash, because traders had little enthusiasm to make sure that their companies enjoyed long-term survival. Most bonus projects are poorly designed, says Professor Malcolm Higgs. He thinks the reason is that organizations try to keep bonus arrangements simple. Nevertheless, he thinks bonus projects can work as long as they link the interests of individual employees with the long-term goals of a business. Bonuses can also encourage cheating. \"Once you start making people's rewards dependent on outcomes rather than behaviors, the evidence is people will do whatever they can to get those outcomes,\" says Professor Edward Deci. \"In many cases the high officials simply lied and cheated to make the stock   price go up so they got huge bonuses.\" But the work of Deci and others suggests the problem with bonuses runs far deeper than poor design or cheating. In 1971, he asked students to solve puzzles, with some receiving cash prizes for doing well and others getting nothing. Deci found those offered cash were less likely to keep working on puzzles after they had done enough to get paid. These studies suggest that offering rewards can stop people doing things for the pure joy of it. This was the basis for a series of books by Kohn in which he argues that rewarding children, students and workers with grades, scholarships and other \"bribes\"   leads to low-quality work in the long run. Those who believe in the power of bonuses fail to distinguish between inner drive and outside pressure -- wanting to do something because you like it for itself in contrast to doing something because you want the reward, Kohn says. \"It's not just that these two are different, it's often that the more you reward people for doing something, the more their inner drive tends to decline.\" A \"do this and get that\" approach might improve performance in the short term, but over longer periods it will always fail, Kohn says. People who receive bonus will naturally play safe, become less creative, cooperate less and feel less valued, he adds.

It has been argued, for instance, that cash bonuses contributed to the financial crash, because traders had little enthusiasm to make sure that their companies enjoyed long-term survival. Most bonus projects are poorly designed, says Professor Malcolm Higgs. He thinks the reason is that organizations try to keep bonus arrangements simple. Nevertheless, he thinks bonus projects can work as long as they link the interests of individual employees with the long-term goals of a business. Bonuses can also encourage cheating. \"Once you start making people's rewards dependent on outcomes rather than behaviors, the evidence is people will do whatever they can to get those outcomes,\" says Professor Edward Deci. \"In many cases the high officials simply lied and cheated to make the stock   price go up so they got huge bonuses.\" But the work of Deci and others suggests the problem with bonuses runs far deeper than poor design or cheating. In 1971, he asked students to solve puzzles, with some receiving cash prizes for doing well and others getting nothing. Deci found those offered cash were less likely to keep working on puzzles after they had done enough to get paid. These studies suggest that offering rewards can stop people doing things for the pure joy of it. This was the basis for a series of books by Kohn in which he argues that rewarding children, students and workers with grades, scholarships and other \"bribes\"   leads to low-quality work in the long run. Those who believe in the power of bonuses fail to distinguish between inner drive and outside pressure -- wanting to do something because you like it for itself in contrast to doing something because you want the reward, Kohn says. \"It's not just that these two are different, it's often that the more you reward people for doing something, the more their inner drive tends to decline.\" A \"do this and get that\" approach might improve performance in the short term, but over longer periods it will always fail, Kohn says. People who receive bonus will naturally play safe, become less creative, cooperate less and feel less valued, he adds. What's more, the studies also suggest that offering rewards can also stop people taking responsibility. Which do you think is the best title of the passage?", "subject": ""}
