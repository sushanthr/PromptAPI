Stand-up comedy differs from Errenzhuan. It normally features a single person on stage, as opposed to a duet. Although music is sometimes included, other features such as dance are a lot rarer. Instead, stand-up comedy is usually just one person, a microphone and the audience. Whether the comedian  _ or has people in fits of laughter is all down to his or her skill. I never used to like the idea of stand-up comedy. It seemed too forced for me. \"I'll laugh when I feel like it,\" I thought. I don't want to have someone stand in front of me, pressuring me to chuckle. Stand-ups also have a reputation for picking on their audience. If you sit close to the front of the stage, you'd better be careful. One cough or wrong move, and the comedian will pounce. Before long, you are the focus of all the jokes. But a couple of years ago, I went to see a comedian who changed my opinion - British stand-up Stewart Lee. He is not hugely famous, but instead of jokes, he told very funny, often long stories about his life. His delivery was dry, and he had a very quick wit.

There are so many different approaches, and people from all sorts of backgrounds can make people laugh in different ways. For example, one of the most popular stand-up comedians in the world is Chris Rock. Rock is African-American, and uses his race, and the problems he faces because of it, as material for his routines.

The Venice Carnival could date back to 1296. It was confirmed on the day before Lent, a public holiday, but it had no direct religious connection at that time. However, the participants were not allowed to wear masks around the city at night; men could not enter convents if they pretended to be women, and celebrations within the convents were strictly  forbidden. People who broke the rules could be put into prison. The laws were not relaxed until the late 17thcentury, when the carnival-goers were allowed to wear masks throughout the carnival. Participants would wear a white mask in old days, while costumes have become even wilder today.

Several minutes after her leaving, the men murdered a person working in the building. Police investigators determined that the woman was the only witness who had seen the two suspects, and could possibly describe them. In an interview with police, her memory of the men proved disappointingly unclear. Several days later, psychologist Ronald P. Fisher was brought in to get a more complete description from the woman. Fisher's interview produced a breakthrough--the woman reported a clear picture of one of the suspects. She then recalled several details about his appearances. This information gave police important leads that enabled them to arrest the suspects and close the case.  Police investigators found the help from Fisher because of his rich knowledge in conducting the so-called cognitive   interview, a kind of memory-rebuilding process. In its original form, the cognitive interview focuses on guiding witnesses through four general recalling techniques: thinking about physical surroundings and personal feelings that existed at the time of past events, reporting everything that comes to mind about those events no matter how broken or unconnected, retelling events in kinds of time orders, beginning to end, end to beginning, forward or backward, and accepting different views while recalling events. Usually, an interviewer begins the cognitive approach by encouraging the witness to take an active role in recalling information rather than giving answers only to someone else's questions. The witness first describes what happened in his or her own words, with no interviewer interruptions. The interviewer then goes further with specific techniques, such as having the witness tell the details of what happened from different aspects. Experiments with police detectives trained in this demanding interview method find that they get nearly 50% more information from witnesses than before training, while error rates remain about the same.

The scientists were a small group of pioneers who explored a world too small to see. What they found there answered some eternal questions--What is life? How is it made ? Why are children like their parents? DNA is without doubt the most powerful substance on earth. The order of its chemicals determines whether a child has her mother's eyes or her father's smile. But as DNA shows, until 50 years ago, almost no one knew of its existence. All that changed when two unknown scientists - Jim Watson and Francis Crick -ran into a pub in Cambridge shouting that they'd found the secret of life. This declaration heralded a momentous discovery, not just for the human race but for the people involved. As this program shows, it was one of the most heated scientific races the world has ever seen.

As consumers became more complicated, frustration with these online advertising techniques grew. Independent programmers began to develop tools that blocked banner and pop-up ads.

Yet because marketing strategies relying heavily on banners and pop-ups produced results, companies invested growing amounts of money into purchasing these ad types. As consumers became more complicated, frustration with these online advertising techniques grew. Independent programmers began to develop tools that blocked banner and pop-up ads. A major development in online marketing came with the introduction of pay-per-click ads. Unlike banner or pop-up ads, which originally required companies to pay every time a website visitor saw an ad, pay-per-click ads allowed companies to pay only when an interested potential customer clicked on an ad. More importantly, however, these ads are not affected by the pop-up and banner blockers. As a result of these advantages and the incredible growth in the use of search engines, which provide excellent places for pay-per-click advertising, a great number of companies began turning to pay-per-click marketing. However, as with the banner and pop-up ads, pay-per-click ads came with their shortcomings. When companies began pouring billions of dollars into this emerging medium, online advertising specialists started to notice the presence of what would later be called click fraud  : representatives of a company with no interest in the product advertised by a competitor click on the competitor's ads simply to increase the marketing cost of the competitor. Click fraud grew so rapidly that marketers sought to diversify   their online positions away from pay-per-click marketing through new mediums. Although pay-per-click advertising remains a common and effective advertising tool, marketers adapted yet again to the changing elements of the Internet by adopting new techniques such as pay-per-performance advertising. As the pace of the Internet's evolution increases, it seems all the more likely that advertising successfully on the Internet will require a strategy that avoids constancy   and welcomes change. What does the author imply about the future of pay-per-performance advertising?", "subject": ""}

Everyone, places for act one!\" called the director. The lights went out and the rehearsal began. Halfway through the first act, Brittany finished her part and went backstage. She grabbed her script from the table and read along with the rehearsal that was still going on in front of the curtain. A small group of fellow actors joined her, and started practicing lines. Suddenly, something wet exploded on the back of Brittany's head! Turning around, she saw a tall girl with a beverage bottle in her hand. Sticky blue liquid slid down Brittany's face. The older girl laughed . Brittany glanced at her, expecting someone else to speak up and defend her. However, they all screamed with laughter and pointed mocking fingers at Brittany, who ran out of the make-up room in dismay.   Ten minutes later, Brittany met me backstage. \"A big girl just sprayed me with this stuff and laughed at me,\" she said, trying to wipe the liquid out of her curly hair. \"All the other girls laughed, too.\" I didn't even know the girl's name, and she was bullying my sister ! When we got home, we looked at the cast list and found that the girl's name was Jessica. Our mom e-mailed the director, who said she would talk to Jessica and arrange time for an apology right before the next rehearsal. Nobody really expected a heartfelt apology from Jessica but Brittany was prepared to forgive her. Before the next rehearsal, the director met Brittany at the door and announced that we had a problem on our hands. \"Jessica swears that she was never even near you yesterday,\" she said. But Brittany knew the truth. As she glanced across the room full of young actors, she glimpsed Jessica sitting in a metal folding chair. For a split second, their eyes met. Jessica quickly turned away to stare in the opposite direction. For weeks afterwards, no matter how hard Brittany tried to talk to her, Jessica refused to look her way. It was very difficult for Brittany to work with Jessica during every rehearsal , for three hours each week. But finally, we were ready to perform.

Mulch is a protective cover of material that is spread on top of soil. It is usually made out of organic material, like crop waste. Farmers may keep the remains of corn or other crops on top of the soil. This creates mulch on the soil surface. The plant remains help protect the soil against wind and water damage. Mulching is one of the best things people can do for their plants. It also helps keep the soil from getting dry, and reduces the need for watering plants. It also limits temperature changes in the soil. And it stops unwanted plants, or weeds, from growing. Organic mulch improves the condition of soil. As the mulch breaks down, it provides material which keeps the soil from getting hard. This improves the growth of roots and increases the movement of water through the soil. It also improves the ability of the soil to hold water. Organic mulch contains nutrients for plants. It also provides good environment for earthworms and other helpful living things in the soil. It is easy to find organic mulch materials. Cut-up leaves and small pieces of tree bark can be used. Grass cuttings are also a good mulch for plants. Mulch from news- papers works well in controlling weeds. The best time to add mulch depends on your goal. Mulch provides a thick barrier between the soil and the air. This helps to reduce temperature changes in the soil. As a result, mulched soil will be cooler than other soil in the summer. In winter, the mulched soil may not freeze as deeply as other soil. The best time is after the ground has frozen, but before the coldest weather arrives.

How much do you know about good nutrition? Are the following statements true or false? 1. People who don't eat meat can stay healthy. True. As long as people eat enough milk, eggs and meat alternates , they can get enough protein. 2. Fresh vegetables cooked at home are always more nutritious than canned vegetables. False. The difference depends more on how vegetables are prepared than whether they are fresh or canned. Vegetables cooked in too much water can lose a large quantity of vitamins. 3. Food eaten between meals can be just as good for health as food eaten at regular meals. True. Nutritional value depends on what types of food you eat, not when you eat them. Eating an egg or an orange between meals can _ a good diet. 4. Taking extra vitamins beyond the recommended daily allowances won't give you more energy. True.

A vitamin has the same properties and specific chemical structure whether made in a laboratory or taken from plant or animal parts. 6. Older people need the same amount of vitamins as younger people. True. Older people need the same quantity of vitamins as younger people although they need fewer calories.

Staff training must have a purpose, which I defined  when a firm considers its training needs, which are in turn based on job descriptions and job specifications. A job description should give details of the performance that is required for a particular job, and a job specification should give information about the behaviour, knowledge and skills that are expected of an employee who works in it. When all of this has been collected, it is possible to make a training specification. This specifies that the training department must teach for the successful performance of the job, and also the best methods to use in the training period. There are many different training methods, and there are advantages and disadvantages of all of them. Successful training performances depend on an understanding of the difference between learning about skills and training in using them. It is frequently said that  learning about skills takes place \"off the job\" in classroom, but training in using these skills takes place \"on the job,\" by means of such activities as practice in the workshop.

For their employers, they feel happy because that is equal to a potential $500 million of 'free' work, which, according to an economist will boost  the output of the economy by about two percent. The report also showed that the main reasons employees give up their remaining annul leave are due to pressures at work and their failing to appreciate that taking a break could make them more productive and, in turn, boost the economy in the long term. The research, done by price comparison website Travel Supermarket, found that more than one in four of those who will give up their remaining holidays (28 percent) will do so due to pressures at work.

{"answer": 3, "choices": ["it was losing money", "most customers didn't like the old logo", "it wanted to get involved in other businesses", "it decided to offer better foods to customers"], "question": "In 1991, Kentucky Fried Chicken announced that it was officially changing its name to \"KFC\" as well as updating its packaging and logo with a more modern look. The public relations reason was that health-conscious consumers associated the word \"fried\" with \"unhealthy\", causing some of them to completely avoid the wide variety of \"healthy\" menu items. The new title and image were designed to attract customers to a restaurant now offering foods branded as \"better for you\". It sounded good, but the real reason behind the shift to KFC had nothing to do with critical consumers. In 1990, the Commonwealth of Kentucky, trapped in debt, took the unusual step of trade marking its name. Therefore, anyone using the word \"Kentucky\" for business reasons would have to obtain permission and pay licensing fees to the Commonwealth of Kentucky. It was an unusual and brilliant scheme to lighten government debt, but it was also one that alienated  one of the most famous companies ever associated with Kentucky.

This resort even has a hotel for those who would prefer to have the unusual experience of sleeping and waking up to the beautiful scenery all around them. The Sabeto Mud Pool If you're looking for something unusual to do, you can't pass up the mud pool at Sabeto.

And you'll realize that it wouldn't have happened if not for that previous disappointment.\" Mother was right, as I discovered after graduating from college in 1932. I had decided to try for a job in radio, then work my way up to sports announcer. I hitchhiked to Chicago and knocked on the door of every station and got turned down every time. In one studio, a kind lady told me that big stations couldn't risk hiring an inexperienced person. \"Go out in the sticks  and find a small station that'll give you a chance,\" she said. I thumbed home to Dixon, Illinois. While there was no radio-announcing job in Dixon, my father said Montgomery Ward had opened a store and wanted a local athlete to manage its sports department. Since Dixon was where I had played high school football, I applied. The job sounded just right for me. But I wasn't hired. My disappointment must have shown. \"Everything happens for the best,\" Mom reminded me. Dad offered me the car to job hunt. I tried WOC Radio in Davenport, Iowa. The program director, a wonderful Scotsman named Peter MacArthur, told me they had already hired an announcer. As I left his office, my frustration boiled over.

For example, we cannot remember everyone we have ever met or what we did on every single day of our lives. However, there are some people who do have _ memories. These people have a rare condition known as savant syndrome  . Savants suffer from a developmental disorder, but they also exhibit great talents that contrast  sharply with their physical and mental disabilities. Kim Peek (1951-2009) was a savant who lived in Salt Lake City, Utah, in the United States. He was born with damage to parts of his brain, but it seemed that other parts of his brain, particularly those relating to memory, became over-developed. Peek's unique abilities appeared at a very early age. When he was just 20 months old, he could already remember every book that was read to him. Peek could read two pages of a book at the same time---one page with the right eye and one with the left---in less than 10 seconds and remember everything he read. By the time he died, Peek had memorized more than 9,000 books. He could remember all the names and numbers in a variety of telephone books. He could remember thousands of facts about history, literature, geography and sports. Dr. David Treffert, an expert on savant syndrome, once described Peek as \"a living Google\" because of his astonishing ability to memorize and connect facts. However, at the same time, Peek was unable to carry out simple tasks, such as brushing his hair or getting dressed, and he needed others to help him. In 1989, the movie Rain Man won the Oscar for best Picture. The main character in the movie, played by Dustin Hoffman, was based on Kim Peek's life.

Playing doctor, they imagine how physicians care for their patients. Playing house, they learn more about how parents feel about their children. Imaginative play helps develop empathy   for others. If children can imagine how it feels to be left out of a game or to lose a pet, they are better able to help those in need. They become more willing to play fair, to share, and to cooperate. Build self-confidence Young children have very little control over their lives. Imagining oneself as a builder of skyscrapers   or a superhero defending the planet is empowering to a child. It helps them develop confidence in their abilities and their potential. Boost intellectual growth Using the imagination is the beginning of abstract thought. Children who can see a king's castle in a mound   of sand or a delicious dinner in a mud pie are learning to think symbolically  . This skill is important in school where a child will have to learn that numerals symbolize groups of objects, letters symbolize sounds, and so on. Practice language skills Kids who play pretend with their friends do a lot of talking. This helps boost their vocabulary, improve sentence structure and promote communication skills. Work out fears Playing pretend can help children work out their fears and worries. When children role-play about the big, bad monster under the bed, they gain a sense of control over him and he doesn't seem quite so big or so bad. Imaginative play also helps kids vent   confusing feelings they might have, such as anger toward a parent or compete with a new sibling  . To encourage your youngster's imagination, read to him every day. Books offer children the opportunity to visit other worlds and create new ones of their own.

Scientists rarely go there. Those few do discover new species all of the time. Many places of the deepest parts of the ocean, where it's forever dark, can light up. Now, a teen's research has shown new light on how one of these swimming animals behaves in darkness. The giant flashlight fish lives in the Indian Ocean as well as in tropical parts of the central and western Pacific. It lives at depths of up to 400 meters, (about 1,300 feet). But not always. Sometimes it lives in coral reefs in shallow waters. In those shallow waters, the blackish-blue fish comes out only at night. Reef-dwelling members of this species tend to be smaller than those living in deeper waters. Those biggies can grow to lengths of 35meters (14inches). That may not sound like a giant, but they are the largest of their type of fish. The giant flashlight fish gets its name from a small glow-in-the-dark patch found in a packet of tissue under each eye, explains Caroline Edmonds.

Parents often give their children an amount of money that they may spend as they wish. The purpose is to let the children learn from experience at an early age when financial mistakes are not very costly. A child may receive an allowance each week or each month. The amount is not so important.  But parents should make clear what the child is expected to pay for with the money. At first, young children may spend all of their allowance soon after they receive it. If they do this, they will learn the hard way that spending must be done within a budget. Parents should not offer more money until the next allowance is to be given. Older children may be responsible enough to budget larger costs like those for clothing. The object is to show young people that a budget demands choices between spending and saving. Many people who have written on the subject say it is not a good idea to pay your child for work around the home. These jobs are a normal part of family life. Paying children to do extra work around the home, however, can be useful. It can even provide an understanding of how a business works. Allowances give children a chance to experience three things they can do with money. They can share it in the form of gifts or giving it to organizations. They can spend it by buying things they want. Or they can save it. Saving helps children understand that costly goals require _ : you have to cut costs and plan for the future. Requiring children to save part of their allowance can also open the door to future saving and investing. Many banks offer free savings accounts for young people with small amounts of money. Which of the following is TRUE according to the passage?", "subject": ""}
{"answer": 2, "choices": ["a robot", "the author's mother", "a telephone operator", "the telephone itself"], "question": "When I was quite young, my father had one of the first telephones in our neighborhood. I remember well the polished old case fastened to the wall. The shiny receiver hung on the side of the box. I was too little to reach the telephone, but used to listen with great interest when my mother used to talk to it. Then I discovered that somewhere inside the wonderful device lived an amazing person-- her name was Information Please and there was nothing she did not know. Information Please could supply anybody's number. My first personal experience with Information Please came one day while my mother was visiting a neighbor. I accidentally hit my finger with a hammer. The pain was terrible, but there didn't seem to be any reason in crying because there was no one home to give sympathy. I walked around the house sucking my hurting finger, finally arriving at the stairway--the telephone! Climbing up I unhooked the receiver and held it to my ear. \"Information Please,\" I said. A click or two and a small clear voice spoke into my ear, \"Information.\" \"I hurt my finger...\" I cried. The tears came readily enough now that I had an audience. \"Isn't your mother home?\" came the question. \"Nobody's home but me.\" I sobbed. \"Are you bleeding?\" \"No,\" I replied. \"I hit my finger with the hammer and it hurts.\" \"Can you open your icebox?\" she asked. I said I could. \"Then chip off a little piece of ice and hold it to your finger.\" After that I called Information Please for everything. I asked her for help with my geography and she told me where Philadelphia was. And there was the time that Petey, our pet canary   died. I called Information Please and told her the sad story. She listened, and then said the usual things grown-ups say to comfort a child. But I was Why is it that birds should sing so beautifully and bring joy to all families, only to end up as a heap of feathers, feet up on the bottom of a cage? She must have sensed my deep concern, for she said quietly, \"Paul, always remember that there are other worlds to sing in.\" Somehow I felt better. Another day I was on the telephone. \"Information Please.\" \"Information,\" said the now familiar voice. \"How do you spell fix?\" I asked. All this took place in a small town in the Pacific Northwest. Then when I was 9 years old, we moved to Boston. I missed my friend very much. Information Please belonged to that old wooden box in former home, and I somehow never thought of trying the tall, shiny new phone that sat on the hall table. Yet as I grew into my teens, the memories of those childhood conversations never really left me; often in moments of doubt and sadness I would recall the sense of security I had then. I appreciated now how patient, understanding, and kind she was to have spent her time on a little boy. A few years later, on my way west to college, my plane put down in Seattle. I had about half an hour or so between planes, and I spent 15 minutes or so on the phone with my sister, who lived there now. Then without thinking what I was doing, I dialed my hometown operator and said, \"Information Please.\" Unexpectedly, I heard again the small, clear voice I knew so well, \"Information.\" I hadn't planned this but I heard myself saying, \"Could you tell me please how to spell fix?\" There was a long pause. Then came the soft spoken answer, \"I guess that your finger must have healed by now.\" I laughed, \"So it's really still you,\" I said. \"I wonder if you have any idea how much you meant to me during that time.\" \"I wonder,\" she said, \"if you know how much your calls meant to me.

The faint light of a candle appeared in the hall. \"Who's the other one?\" \"A new friend.\" They went up some dark and broken stairs.

Oliver almost wanted to run away, but just then Dodger pushed open a door and pulled Oliver into a dark hall. \"Who's there?\" a voice cried out. \"It's me,\" said Dodger. The faint light of a candle appeared in the hall. \"Who's the other one?\" \"A new friend.\" They went up some dark and broken stairs. Oliver could hardly see where he was going, but Dodger seemed to know the way, and helped Oliver up. They entered a room with walls that were black with age and dirt. In front of the fire was a table with a candle stuck into a bottle of beer, and an old man, with a horribly ugly face and red hair, stood next to the fire cooking. He was wearing a dirty old coat and seemed to divide his attention between his cooking and a number of silk handkerchiefs, which were hanging near the fire. There were several rough beds in the room. Four or five boys, about the same age as Dodger, sat round the table, smoking and drinking like middle-aged men. They all looked up when Dodger and Oliver entered. \"This is him, Fagin,\" Dodger said to the old man. \"My friend Oliver Twist.\" Fagin smiled and shook Oliver's hand. Then all the young gentlemen came up to him and shook both his hands very hard, especially the hand which held his few possessions. One of the boys was particularly kind. He even put his hands in Oliver's pockets so that Oliver would not have to empty them himself when he went to bed. The boys would probably have been even more helpful, but Fagin hit them on their heads and shoulders until they left Oliver alone. \"We're very glad to see you, Oliver,\" said Fagin. \"I see you're staring at the handkerchiefs, my dear. Aren't there a lot? We've just taken them all out to wash them, that's all! Ha! Ha! Ha!\" This seemed to be a joke, as the old gentleman and all his young friends gave loud shouts of laughter. Then supper began. Oliver ate his share of the food and was then given a glass of gin-and-water. Fagin told him to drink it fast. Immediately afterwards, Oliver felt himself lifted onto one of the beds and he sank into a deep sleep. According to the passage, we can infer from the passage that   _  .", "subject": ""}

Asthma is a lung disease. A person with asthma may cough or suffer from shortness of breath. Asthma can begin at any age. Childhood asthma, often beginning when a child is younger than 10 years old, is one of the most common childhood diseases. Doctors report that the number of young people with asthma is increasing. It is the number one cause of absence from school. If parents have asthma, their children are more likely to develop the disease. Children in homes where an adult smokes are more at risk. It is important to find out the _ for asthma. As we know, dust, pollen, or animals often make people suffer from asthma. Once a child learns the triggers, he can help prevent future attacks. About half of all children outgrow asthma and then asthma attacks stop when they are teenagers. However, many people live with the disease into adulthood. Children often take control drugs once or twice a day to help prevent asthma attacks, if a child begins to have an asthma attack, a quick-relief drug is also necessary. This is often an inhaler. School-aged children usually carry their inhalers with them. This medication works quickly and children begin to breathe more easily in a few minutes.

{"answer": 2, "choices": ["The trees were taller and stronger.", "The soil was softer for seeds to develop.", "The climate there was warmer and wetter.", "The temperature was lower along the Pacific coast."], "question": "Redwood trees are the tallest plants on the earth,reaching heights of up to 100 meters.They are also known for their longevity,typically 500 to 1000 years,but sometimes more than 2000 years.A hundred million years ago,in the age of dinosaurs,redwoods were common in the forests of a much more moist and tropical North America.As the climate became drier and colder,they declined to a narrow strip along the Pacific coast of Northern Califomia. The trunk of redwood trees is very strong and usually forms a single straight column.It is covered with a soft bark.This bark can be pretty thick,well over two feet in the more mature trees.It gives the older trees a certain kind of protection from insects,but the main benefit is that it keeps the center of the tree harmless from moderate forest fires because of its thickness.This fire resistant quality explains why the giant redwood grows to live that long.While most other types of trees are destroyed by forest fires,the giant redwood actually prospers because of them. Moderate fires will clear the ground of competing plant life,and the rising heat dries and opens the ripe fruit of the redwood,releasing many thousands of seeds onto the ground below.

I'm talking about video games. These games can be fun and exciting, but we need to look out when this pastime becomes an addiction. Games are often quite exciting and dramatic, but they generally aren't very intellectual. We don't learn as much from them as we would only reading a book. Spending too much time playing them can take away our study time. We need to remember that we are students first. Nothing should ever get in the way of proper studying. Video games can also be a bad effect on younger children who may be watching. Many video games are violent and the object in most of them is to kill the other player(s). This does not send the right message to the children who need to be told that violence is not acceptable and need to be taught how to deal with situations maturely. Even if we do need to sit down and play a violent video game, we need to make sure that it is not affect the younger people around us. Playing a computer game in our spare time is not a bad thing. Games can be a great way to relax after studying, to connect to our friends, or just to help our creativity. However, games should not become the focus of our life. We need to make sure that laying games never interferes with our studies and that we aren't thinking about them all day.

Ever since the first robot was created decades ago, scientists have kept thinking about the task of making robots more like humans. However, as they have gotten closer to that goal, doubts have grown. According to the BBC, Japanese robot designer Masahiro Mori argues that the more lifelike robots become, the more humans feel a connection to them. But once they become too similar to humans, people begin to feel uncomfortable. This theory is what led to the creation of a brand new robot in Switzerland earlier this month. Roboy, as the new machine is called, has various human-like abilities such as hand-shaking and bicycle-riding, but instead of a skin-like covering, Roboy is wrapped in shiny white armor   that clearly shows its robot status. \"As long as people can clearly see that the robot is a machine, even if they project their feelings into it, then they feel comfortable,\" Rolf Pfeifer, the creator of Roboy from the University of Zurich, Switzerland, told the BBC. But the problem that people have with robots is not just with the way they look. It also has to do with the roles that they play in our lives. A survey last year of European Union countries showed that 88 percent of those interviewed agreed that robots are \"necessary as they can do jobs that are too hard or dangerous for people\", such as space exploration and war fighting. But when it comes to taking care of children, 60 percent said that robots should not be allowed to participate, because as robots become more advanced and complicated, parents may tend to hand over too much responsibility to them.

But the real truth is that we don't know enough to relieve global warming, and--without major technological breakthroughs--we can't do much about it. From 2003 to 2050, the world's population is estimated to grow from 6.4 billion to 9.1 billion, a 42% increase. If energy use per person and technology remain the same, total energy use and greenhouse gas emissions (mainly, CO2) will be 42% higher in 2050. But that's too low, because societies that grow richer use more energy. We need economic growth unless we condemn the world's poor people to their present poverty and freeze everyone else's living standards. With modest economic growth, energy use and greenhouse emissions more than double by 2050. No government will adopt rigid restrictions on economic growth and personal freedom (limits on electricity usage, driving and travel) that might cut back global warming.

Hold the glance for a second longer and you have made a different situation, there is a permissible time that you can hold a person's stare without being friendly, rude, or aggressive. If you are on a lift, what stare-time are you permitted? To answer this question, consider what you typically do. You very likely give other passengers a quick glance to size them up and to assure them that you mean no harm. Since being close to another person signals the possibility of interaction, you need to send out a signal telling others you want to be left alone. So you cut off eye contact----what sociologist Erving Goffiman calls \"a dimming  of the lights\". You look down at the floor, at the indicator  lights, anywhere but into another passenger's eyes. Should you break the rule against staring at a stranger on a lift, you will make the other person extremely uncomfortable, and you are likely to feel a bit strange yourself. If you hold eye contact for more than 3 seconds, what are you telling another person? Much depends on the person and the situation. For instance, a man and a woman communicate interest in this manner. They stare at each other for about 3 seconds at a time, and then drop their eyes down for 3 seconds, before letting their eyes meet again. But if one man gives another man a 3-second-plus stare, he signals, \"I know you\", \"I am interested in you\" or \"You look peculiar  and I am curious about you\". This type of stare often produces hostile  feelings. If one is looked at by a stranger for too long, he tends to feel   _  .", "subject": ""}

You very likely give other passengers a quick glance to size them up and to assure them that you mean no harm. Since being close to another person signals the possibility of interaction, you need to send out a signal telling others you want to be left alone. So you cut off eye contact----what sociologist Erving Goffiman calls \"a dimming  of the lights\". You look down at the floor, at the indicator  lights, anywhere but into another passenger's eyes. Should you break the rule against staring at a stranger on a lift, you will make the other person extremely uncomfortable, and you are likely to feel a bit strange yourself. If you hold eye contact for more than 3 seconds, what are you telling another person? Much depends on the person and the situation. For instance, a man and a woman communicate interest in this manner. They stare at each other for about 3 seconds at a time, and then drop their eyes down for 3 seconds, before letting their eyes meet again. But if one man gives another man a 3-second-plus stare, he signals, \"I know you\", \"I am interested in you\" or \"You look peculiar  and I am curious about you\". This type of stare often produces hostile  feelings. If you want to be left alone on a lift, the best thing to do is   _  .", "subject": ""}

Some scientists used to suppose that they must have traveled there on a raft, a journey of around 5,000 miles from South America to the islands. There are documented cases of iguanas reaching remote Caribbean islands and the Galapagos Islands on floating logs. But new research in January by Brice Noonan and Jack Sites suggested that iguanas may have simply walked to Fiji and Tonga when the islands were still a part of an ancient southern supercontinent.

You will always be as strong as you want to be.\" Travis picked up that lecture in one of his G&G training courses, an education program that began on his first day and continues throughout an employee's occupation. The training has, Travis says, changed his life. G&G has taught him how to live, how to focus, how to get to work on time, and how to master his emotions  . Most importantly, it taught him willpower. At the center of that education is an extreme focus on an all-important habit; willpower. Dozens of cases show that willpower is the single most important habit for a person's success. And the best way to strengthen willpower is to make it into a habit. \"Sometimes it looks like people with great self-control aren't working hard--but that's because they've made it automatic,\" Angela Duckworth, one of the University of Pennsylvania researchers said. \"Their willpower occurs without them having to think about it.\" The company spent millions of dollars developing programs of study to train employees on self-control. Managers wrote workbooks that serve as guides to how to make willpower a habit in workers' lives.

But is it also for people who want to fly over a rainforest sky before checking into a comfortable and expensive hotel in the middle of a national park? Whatever ecotourism is, it is hot--perhaps too hot for its own good. The World Tourism Organization claims that the industry looked after 592 million travelers last year who spent $423 billion, and of all the types of tourism, ecotourism seems to be the fastest growing. By the broadest measure -- a trip with some sort of nature or wilderness element -- ecotourism already accounts for perhaps a third of these travelers. On a stricter definition favored by the Ecotourism Society, it is \"responsible travel that preserves natural environments and keeps up the well-being of local people,\" which accounts for no more than 5% of tourism. Ideally, ecotourism helps both people and nature. Before the disastrous civil war, Rwanda's Mountain Gorilla Project was one such model. Visits to the gorillas were limited, local guides ensured good behavior or on the part of the humans, and the high admission charge - $170 a day -- paid for salaries and presentation of the gorillas' living areas. As this made the gorillas worth more alive than dead, poaching   decreased. As another example, preservation Cooperation, Africa's largest ecotour operator, uses only local labor, buys products 5om local farmers, and supports building projects: such as clinics and schools. This contribution to social advance is also good business sense. Projects from which local people benefit directly are less likely to be affected by poaching and theft. Ecotourism's biggest problem is labeling. Going on an eco-tour is no guarantee of good ecology. So far, only Australia has an official system to grade tour operators and tourist attractions on the basis of their \"greenness\". Another issue is how eco-tourists damage the environment. Dolphin-feeding, for instance, is innocent and enjoyable, but after too many free meals, the dolphins forget how to catch their own dinners. Keeping prices high is one way to limit enthusiasm. But measuring the effect of ecotourism on human environments is trickier. It is common, for villagers to see ecotourism as a source of new income.

The world's population would grow very quickly at that. Animals and plants would die out, because humans needed the food. There would be no room for more people in the world. Scientists would most likely try to create living 'communities' underwater, on the moon, and in space stations. The state of starvation and lack of space would be difficult to deal with. Natural selection would happen with humans, which is when certain types of animals or plants are selected for, or selected against. For instance, rich humans and strong, tough humans would be more likely to live, because the rich could afford to buy the limited food, and the tough humans could kill people for their food, and steal the food. This possibility relates directly to the assumption that humans would not die of diseases and such, but must be killed or run out of the necessities for living. If you mean that no one could ever die, even if they were shot, burned, starved and eaten, then that would never ever happen; _ . However, if that were the case, then at some point, if there were not more areas to live than the land that humans live on now, then we would end up so packed that it would be virtually impossible to move, and humans would be forced to be on top of other people. It would be ridiculously crowded. Although, if humans lived forever, then I assume that we would all be extremely smart, and would have figured out solutions to the living situations, like on another planet, on the moon, under water, etc. What is the author's main purpose of writing the passage?", "subject": ""}

{"answer": 2, "choices": ["In a fashion magazine.", "In the advertisement section of a newspaper.", "From an entertainment report in a newspaper.", "From a finance journal."], "question": "In recent months, a catchy song, A Little Apple, has become such a hit that it has even inspired square-dancing troupes  to mimic  its music video. When Old Boys: The Way of the Dragon, an adventure comedy featuring the song, was released on July 10, the unusual publicity strategy was applauded. Ticket sales of Old Boys: The Way of the Dragon surpassed 150 million yuan in the first week of hitting the big screen. Interactive online campaigns involving fans have become a popular way to promote a movie. The first two episodes  of Tiny Times, the directing debut  of author, Guo Jingming, made 800 million yuan at the box office last year, in spite of criticism for its portrayal  of lavish  lifestyles. Before the third episode was shown, fans donated a small sum of money online as \"investors\" in the movie. Some of the people who donated received film souvenirs, or the chance to visit the film set. Han Han, Guo's major competitor, has just released his directorial debut, road-trip comedy, The Continent. Han has over 38 million followers on Sina Weibo, China's major micro-blogging platform. He has broadcast the filming process of the movie to his followers since he began shooting. The film's trailer was released online in May, only three days after shooting and it has been viewed 4.7 million times. \"I don't care too much about the surprising numbers online, and what matters more is whether the movie is good or not,\" Han once said. However, when he invited popular singer, Pu Shu, to write the closing song for the movie, he must have had another idea in mind. Pu, who has been away from the public eye for some 11 years, also brings a new element for the movie claiming to be devoted to young people. The song became very popular as soon as it was released online. No one knows what other trump cards will be thrown on the table during the tense online campaign this summer.

One afternoon after the final exam,we four girls came to a small wood and we felt _ only belonging to us that afternoon.We talked and laughed.We played all the games that we could think of.We felt we were on the top of the world for the first time in our life.We totally forgot the unhappiness in our life and we threw the homework and the endless exams far away out of the wood. In the middle of the wood ran a small and peaceful stream.Now and then,we could see some wild ducks on the water looking for food.The water weeds danced happily while the water passed beside them.The air was so fresh that we breathed it freely. The sun had set before we knew it.We had to leave the place which brought us much happiness.We agreed to come back again every time we felt bored. Years later,we went there several times.But,every time we went there to find that great feeling,we failed.Strangely,the feeling was different from that of several years ago. I know that wonderful experience was just for once.We can never find that kind of happiness again which only belonged to the special afternoon in our life.That was a release of our uneasy heart.We can never go back to that young age or that simple life.It was our golden ages.No matter how boring and hard the life was,it gave us something worthy to recall.We'll treasure it forever.

These very small loans  , usually less than US$200, have enabled the very poorest people to set up or expand businesses and become self-sufficient. The micro-credit movement started with Professor Muhammad Yunus, who founded the Grameen Bank in Bangladesh. Professor Yunus, who won the 2006 Nobel Peace Prize, used his own money to set up a bank to benefit the poorest people in Bangladesh--families living on less than US$1 a day. There are now hundreds of organizations around the world following his blueprint to help people escape from poverty. So how does the system work? Local microfinance institutions (MFIs) make contact with families and offer loans, usually to women, to enable them to start or expand a business. These are very poor people who would not normally be able to get credit, but as no collateral   is required they can get micro-credits. They pay back the loan on a weekly basis, over six months to a year. A very important aspect to the success of the micro-credit system is that receivers get local support. The MFIs educate local communities about ways to improve their lives, and offer practical support as well as collecting weekly loans payments. They encourage people to help each other, so that the whole community can pull itself out of poverty. MFIs may also help with literacy and health problems. Micro-credits are mainly given to women. Experience has shown that women are more motivated to improve their children's lives and will spend the money they make on better nutrition and schooling for their children. This may be the first chance they've had to contribute financially to the family, and their status in the home and the local community is raised. The micro-credit system is not charity. The payments are fixed-term loans and interest is charged. The costs of making such small loans, collecting them and giving personal support are high. This is shown in the interest rates, which range from 15 to 35 percent.

{"answer": 2, "choices": ["Health", "Business", "Finance", "Education"], "question": "Millions of families around the world have been given a helping hand out of poverty   by micro-credits. These very small loans  , usually less than US$200, have enabled the very poorest people to set up or expand businesses and become self-sufficient. The micro-credit movement started with Professor Muhammad Yunus, who founded the Grameen Bank in Bangladesh. Professor Yunus, who won the 2006 Nobel Peace Prize, used his own money to set up a bank to benefit the poorest people in Bangladesh--families living on less than US$1 a day. There are now hundreds of organizations around the world following his blueprint to help people escape from poverty. So how does the system work? Local microfinance institutions (MFIs) make contact with families and offer loans, usually to women, to enable them to start or expand a business. These are very poor people who would not normally be able to get credit, but as no collateral   is required they can get micro-credits. They pay back the loan on a weekly basis, over six months to a year. A very important aspect to the success of the micro-credit system is that receivers get local support. The MFIs educate local communities about ways to improve their lives, and offer practical support as well as collecting weekly loans payments. They encourage people to help each other, so that the whole community can pull itself out of poverty. MFIs may also help with literacy and health problems. Micro-credits are mainly given to women. Experience has shown that women are more motivated to improve their children's lives and will spend the money they make on better nutrition and schooling for their children. This may be the first chance they've had to contribute financially to the family, and their status in the home and the local community is raised. The micro-credit system is not charity. The payments are fixed-term loans and interest is charged. The costs of making such small loans, collecting them and giving personal support are high. This is shown in the interest rates, which range from 15 to 35 percent. Despite this, the repayment rate is very high, between 95 and 98 per cent, showing that micro-credit clients really value this opportunity to leave poverty behind. The passage is most probably taken from the   _   section of a magazine.", "subject": ""}

Breast, colorectal, lung, gastric and thyroid cancers are the five most common cancer forms among women, with breast cancer accounting for 16 percent of Shanghai's new cases each year and colorectal cancer 13 percent. Cervical cancer, although only the 12th leading cancer in women in Shanghai, is particularly common among women between 25 and 54 years old. Dr Zheng Ying, director of the center's tumor prevention and control department, said , \"breast, colorectal and cervical cancers accounted for 32 percent of female cancers\".

{"answer": 2, "choices": ["British accents are different from North to South.", "Class division is getting smaller at present.", "It is about the \"North-South Division\" and its influence.", "Northerners and Southerners dislike each other in Britain."], "question": "If you have seen or heard of the British TV series Downton Abbey, you have probably noticed an \"upstairs-downstairs\" class system in which the noble people are upstairs, worrying what clothes they should wear for dinner and the poor people are downstairs, working hard to make food and tea. So it's not hard to tell that people are divided into different classes. British society has changed a lot since the days of Downton Abbey, but the division still exists and the funny accents do, too. Nowadays, what divides Britons is the so-called \"North-South divide\". As you make your way north from the south coast of England, the accent begins to change. The posh \"How are you\" in parts of the South becomes \"Ahhdu\" (how do you do) in the Midlands, \"reeit\" (are you all right) in the North West, \"eyyup\" (what's up) in Yorkshire, and \"hou's it gaun\" (how's it going) in Scotland. Besides accents, the economy also changes. The rich southern city of London slowly becomes the North where people general have less money. So where does the \"South\" stop being the \"South\" and the \"North\" start being the \"North\"? Well, depending on where someone comes from in Britain, you'll get a different answer. \"Anywhere above London is 'the North',\" you might hear a Londoner say. Or if you're in Scotland, you might hear, \"Southern softer!\", talking about a person from Lancashire or Yorkshire, who think of themselves as \"hard (tough) Northerners\". \"Anywhere south of Manchester is not northern,\" you might hear a person from Manchester say. Many stereotypes   have come from the \"North-South Divide\", too. Often, southerners are seen as being rude and snobbish   by northerners. And northerners are often seen as uneducated by southerners. Today, the career you have and the person you marry don't depend on where you were born or what class you are from. But as London is getting richer and people are moving to the South for work, the North-South divide is getting bigger. Yet for all that divides us, the truth is, we couldn't live without each other!

You haven't slept well, your hair is a mess. Worse, you can't stop yawning. Yawning is universal to humans and many animals. Cats, dogs and fish yawn just like humans do! Yawning is an involuntary(,) action during which you open your mouth and breathe deeply. The average duration of a yawn is about 6 seconds. The purpose and cause of yawning are still a mystery. Scientists are not sure what causes a yawn. People yawn when they are tired or bored, but they also yawn when they aren't. There are many ideas explaining why we yawn. One idea is that yawning is a way for the body to become more alert by taking in more oxygen. A yawn increases the heart rate, forces carbon dioxide out of the lungs and blood stream, and brings oxygen to the brain. But one study showed that volunteers given a lot of oxygen did not yawn any less than before, while those given a lot of carbon dioxide did not yawn more. Another idea is that early humans used yawning as a form of communication. If one decided it was time to sleep, they would tell the others by yawning and they would do it in return to show they agreed. A third explanation comes from psychology professor Gordon Gallup of University at Albany in New York. He said that as people yawn, they cool off their brains. \"Brains are like computers.\" he said. \"They only operate efficiently and effectively when they're cool. Many things connected to yawning, like being tired, make the brain hot, and yawning can reduce the heat.\" Scientists have sent people into space, and created terrible nuclear weapons, but there are lots of seemingly simple things, such as why we yawn, or hiccup , that they can't figure out.

So what do Americans think of the foreign visitors who arrive for the heat, just when locals from the United States try to avoid it? Park manager Brenda Henson says, \" The foreigners want to experience the heat in Death Valley. We think it's crazy.\" In fact, Death Valley is a series of salt flats   225 km long and 6 km to 26 km wide. Birds and animals are largely absent, and only the plants have some chance of existence in this extreme place.

The more happy people you know, the more likely you are yourself to be happy. And getting connected to happy people improves a person's own happiness. Researchers have been analyzing a collection of facts from tracking sheets dating back to 1971, following births, marriages, deaths, and divorces. Volunteers also listed the information of their closest friends, co-workers, and neighbors. They assessed   happiness with a simple, four-question test. \"People are asked how often during the past week, one, I enjoyed life, two, I was happy, three, I felt hopeful about the future, and four, I felt that I was just as good as other people,\" Fowler said. The 60 percent of people who scored highly on all four questions were regarded as happy, while the rest were considered unhappy. People with the most social connections -- friends, spouses  , neighbors,  s -- were also the happiest, the data showed. \"Each additional happy person makes you happier,\" Christakis said. And happiness is more infectious than unhappiness, they discovered. If a social contact is happy, it increases the possibility that you are happy by 15 percent. A friend of a friend, or the friend of a spouse or a sibling  , if they are happy, increases your chances by 10 percent. A happy third-degree friend -- the friend of a friend of a friend -- increases a person's chances of being happy by 6 percent. But every extra unhappy friend increases the possibility that you'll be unhappy by only 7 percent. The finding is interesting and useful. Among other benefits, happiness has been shown to have an important effect on reduced death rate, pain reduction, and improved heart function. So better understanding of how happiness spreads can help us learn how to promote a healthier society.

The ocean quahog, a type of deep-sea clam, was dredged   alive from the bottom of the North Atlantic near Iceland in 2006 by researchers. They then put it in a fridge-freezer, as is normal practice, unaware of its age. It was only when it was taken to a laboratory that scientists from Bangor University studied it and concluded it was 400 years old. The discovery made it into the Guinness Book of World Records. However, by this time, it was too late for Ming the Mollusc , named after the Chinese dynasty when its life began. Unfortunately researchers who calculated Ming's age killed it instantly by opening its shell. The researchers opened the ancient clam up to judge its age by counting growth rings inside. But the rings were so close together that scientists ended up having to count the rings on the outside to be accurate, leading CBS journalists to point out that if scientists had just started there, Ming could have lived on. Now, after examining the quahog more closely, using more advanced methods, the researchers have found the animal was actually 100 years older than they first thought.

{"answer": 3, "choices": ["The telecom firm.", "The local residents.", "Travelers to Nepal.", "Mount Everest explorers."], "question": "Climbers at the top of Mount Everest, the world's highest peak, will now be able to make video calls and surf the Internet on their mobile phones, a Nepalese   telecom group claims. Ncell, a branch company of Swedish phone giant TeliaSonera, said on Thursday it had set up a high-speed third-generation (3G) phone base station at an altitude of 5,200 metres in the Everest region. \"Today we made the world's highest video call from Mount Everest base camp successfully. The coverage   of the network will reach up to the peak of Mount Everest,\" Ncell Nepal chief Pasi Koistinen told reporters in Kathmandu. The installation   will also help tens of thousands of tourists and hikers who visit the world's highest mountain every year. Climbers who reached its 8,848-metre peak previously depended on expensive satellite phones and a voice-only network set up by China Mobile in 2007 on the Chinese side of the mountain. \"This is a great milestone for mobile communications as the 3G high speed Internet will bring faster, more affordable telecommunication services from the world's tallest mountain,\" said Lars Nyberg, chief executive of TeliaSonera, which owns 80 percent of Ncell. The 3G services will be fast enough to make video calls and use the Internet, said the company, which also claimed the world's lowest 3G base at 1,400 metres below sea level in a mine in Europe. Despite the installation in Mount Everest, telecom services cover less than one-third of the 28 million people of Nepal, one of the poorest countries in the world. TeliaSonera said it planned to invest $ 100 million in the next year to ensure that mobile coverage increases to more than 90 per cent of the Himalayan nation's population. The 3G network on Mount Everest puts TeliaSonera ahead of state-controlled Nepal Telecom, Indian-owned United Telecom and China Mobile.

Ncell, a branch company of Swedish phone giant TeliaSonera, said on Thursday it had set up a high-speed third-generation (3G) phone base station at an altitude of 5,200 metres in the Everest region. \"Today we made the world's highest video call from Mount Everest base camp successfully. The coverage   of the network will reach up to the peak of Mount Everest,\" Ncell Nepal chief Pasi Koistinen told reporters in Kathmandu. The installation   will also help tens of thousands of tourists and hikers who visit the world's highest mountain every year. Climbers who reached its 8,848-metre peak previously depended on expensive satellite phones and a voice-only network set up by China Mobile in 2007 on the Chinese side of the mountain. \"This is a great milestone for mobile communications as the 3G high speed Internet will bring faster, more affordable telecommunication services from the world's tallest mountain,\" said Lars Nyberg, chief executive of TeliaSonera, which owns 80 percent of Ncell. The 3G services will be fast enough to make video calls and use the Internet, said the company, which also claimed the world's lowest 3G base at 1,400 metres below sea level in a mine in Europe. Despite the installation in Mount Everest, telecom services cover less than one-third of the 28 million people of Nepal, one of the poorest countries in the world. TeliaSonera said it planned to invest $ 100 million in the next year to ensure that mobile coverage increases to more than 90 per cent of the Himalayan nation's population. The 3G network on Mount Everest puts TeliaSonera ahead of state-controlled Nepal Telecom, Indian-owned United Telecom and China Mobile.

I was there to take pictures of the \"broken food system\". As a special visitor, I was greeted with songs and dances. The locals used to sing and dance all the time but now Turkana is silent and has been for some years. No one is singing or dancing any more because they have no food, nothing to celebrate. Many of them are surviving on a little corn a day and water, which they can get just every two days. I met Tede Lokapelo, a local farmer who described the experience of a six-year drought . Tede used to have 200 goats, but now he has only seven left. He told me that this drought has taught him a hard lesson: It is too difficult to keep animals. He lives on animals. His traditional way of life has been completely destroyed now. Without the food aid  they got, Tede is certain that they would starve because there are no other ways to feed themselves left. Sadly, the same can be heard in almost any developing country around the world. Almost one billion people go to bed hungry each night. The food system is broken. In Turkana, not enough rain has fallen since 2005. They measure  rainfall not in days or weeks but in minutes. More and more people are being forced to rely on food aid, but people like Tede don't want food aid. They want to work and develop their country. It's our responsibility  to change the situation so that they can support themselves.

They had been planted by a very old gardener who took care that they would all grow up to be straight and healthy. However, the area was hit by strong winds, and the little trees preferred to avoid the annoying winds, so they bent  their trunks   and branches to protect themselves. The old man, knowing they could never grow well like this, decided to straighten them out, and spent many hours tying their tiny trunks to supporting poles , hoping his beloved trees would understand he was doing this for their own good. But those naughty trees disliked all the wind. They always avoided the gardener's help by bending themselves, hiding from the wind.

{"answer": 1, "choices": ["Declaring when the UK is at war.", "Travelling around the world for charity projects.", "Inviting other world leaders to visit the UK.", "Signing Commonwealth documents every day."], "question": "The British royal family is about to be slimmed down. The queen plans to reduce the number of real royals, as was recently announced. However, there seems little sign of the monarchy   disappearing completely. Up till the 17th century, the British king or queen was believed to rule by \"divine   right\", which was the idea that God chose the king or queen to rule and that he or she was therefore above the law. However, this idea ended with the English Revolution, in which King Charles I was imprisoned and then killed in 1649. So what role does the British royal family have today? Well, the Queen has important formal duties: as Head of State, the Queen represents the UK on visits abroad and invites other world leaders to visit the UK. As Head of the Armed Forces, only the Queen can declare when the UK is at war or when war is over.

In addition, the royal family spends a great deal of its time traveling up and down the country in support of different charity projects.

This is correct because life teaches us what is correct to do and what is not. Let's consider a mistake that one has made while trying to learn to drive. It is true that, for a beginner, it is common to make mistakes, but after doing something wrong once, twice or three times, it is quite impossible to make the same mistake a fourth time. Everyone tries their best in order to improve their skills and they will be very pleased to notice that these improvements really happen. On the other hand, being successful in everything he does, one cannot know what failure means. He would always see only the best side of things and it would be difficult for him to face the difficulties to come in the future. Here we can mention the case of a very successful football player, who has known what fame   is from the very beginning of his career. We have to admit that most of his luck originates from the great talent that he was born with. But some fellow players can also work to achieve the same thing because they make mistakes in their games and they learn from each mistake that they make. In the end, we can say that one needs to make mistakes in life in order to better appreciate things. And at the same time, mistakes teach us how important it is to fight for something we wish for in life. Of course, moments of happiness will come in return when we see the changes or improvements. What is the author's attitude towards someone that is always successful at something?", "subject": ""}

Now the team is saying it has unearthed even more pieces of the puzzle, including a jawbone and parts of arms, legs and hands from several individuals, as well as stone tools. They reported their find in Nature this month. \"The new evidence makes it very clear that these people are a new species, distinct from modern humans,\" Peter Brown, a scientist on the team, said. They named these ancient humans Homo floresiensis. Brown says that these little people lived as recently as 12,000 years ago. If Homo floresiensis was a different species from modern humans, that would make our family tree bigger than we knew. It means, says Brown, that \"until recently, a   shared the planet with us.\" Many scientists think a new species is unlikely. Some argue that the bones must have belonged to modern humans whose small size was the result of a genetic problem. Daniel E. Lieberman, a scientist at Harvard University, thinks that the debate over the discovery is healthy. He believes that the questions and arguments raised by critics will help us learn more about these unusual skeletons. \"Disagreement is an important part of the scientific process,\" Lieberman said. \"As far as I'm concerned, the story's only just begun.\" Which of the following might be the best title of the passage?", "subject": ""}

Then she called the police, who arrived quickly. They broke into the room. The floor was covered in water and the bathtub was full of chocolate and honey. \"He seemed so nice and friendly.

{"answer": 3, "choices": ["Slow and boring.", "Fast and interesting", "Peaceful but exciting", "Quick and violent."], "question": "With kings, artists and writers playing chess, you might get the idea that chess is the most civilized game. But you'd be wrong. A Scandinavian manuscript ,900 years old, tells of how one player, who lost a game, picked up the board and hit his opponent on the head with it.  _  Grandmasters have called it \"a blood sport\", like a fight to the death with broken bottles\" and \"very dangerous--you have to kill people.\" If you agree with the old saying that life is too short for chess, play blitz chess. Five minutes on the clock. Now players think chess is slow and boring, but blitz is an extremely exciting sport, and as aggressive  as any martial art . In parks in Russia, where they gather in summer to play blitz, the players don't just take pieces, they knock them off the board onto the ground. And in the classic game, even world championship players have been known to kick each other under the table. With all this aggression, and the stories of nervous breakdowns among chess players, it's worth remembering that chess can heal as well as harm. My own favorite chess story is that of John Healy. His autobiography , The Grass Arena , was made into a great film by the BBC. Healy was a failed boxer who became the most serious kind of alcoholic. He became homeless. The bottle nearly killed him. But in prison, he discovered chess, and managed to give up drinking completely. He is now a successful chess player, journalist and writer. Healy is played in the film by the British actor Mark Rylance. It's the performance of a lifetime--chess makes surprisingly good cinema. There is a moving scene where Healy tries to find the words to describe how his life has changed. \"It's like boxing again...,but not with fists...   with the mind.\" Which of the following best describes blitz chess?", "subject": ""}

We really have our share of disagreements, but on this one I stand firm: I think 90 sounds pretty fantastic. My mother says she never thought she would live this long. She was weak and had two near fatal   illnesses under the age of 12. And then there was the fear of cancer. Her mother died of breast cancer when my mother was just 17, at a time when there was no such thing as Breast Cancer Awareness Month.  When I was 17 years old, I was worried that my life would parallel hers. I never shared my fears. Instead I would lie awake at night in my bed with the yellow and orange flowered bedspread she had made for me, counting how much time we had left together.  What I didn't know until years later was that she had had the same fear. She told me how she would write away for every piece of information she could find on how to prevent the fatal disease until my father made her stop. He told her she had to relax and stop worrying so much. She was going to be OK. He was right. And one October, many years into the future, we would celebrate her 90th birthday. My mother is the reason I live the life I do. Her fierceness and independence was how I learned to walk the path I have chosen. She was always a forward thinker, reading up on what's new and willing to try something different. She taught me kindness and to look out for those less fortunate than us.  When Dad died far too young, my mother was the one who sat me down the afternoon after the funeral and told me life would go on, and that as hard as it was to imagine, I would be happy again. She helped me to understand that death was a part of life we could never escape and we must learn to accept it.  Our roles have changed in recent years. She turns to me for help now. She asks me what to do. She is the one to call me when she is worried or concerned or needs help with something. I am the one who takes her shopping instead of her taking me. I am the one baking her favorite Greek cookies instead of her surprising me.  She tells me constantly how proud she is of me and how grateful she is for what I do for her. She doesn't know from where I get my calm and how I do all I do. She says that now she learns from me. And while I know that is all true, I am still learning from her. My mother is one of the strongest people I know. I am more fortunate. I have had her to lead the way. And I am so grateful. The gift of her long life has been a gift to me.

She has asked me to keep it a secret and tell people she is only 89. For some reason she seems to think this sounds better. We really have our share of disagreements, but on this one I stand firm: I think 90 sounds pretty fantastic. My mother says she never thought she would live this long. She was weak and had two near fatal   illnesses under the age of 12. And then there was the fear of cancer. Her mother died of breast cancer when my mother was just 17, at a time when there was no such thing as Breast Cancer Awareness Month.  When I was 17 years old, I was worried that my life would parallel hers. I never shared my fears. Instead I would lie awake at night in my bed with the yellow and orange flowered bedspread she had made for me, counting how much time we had left together.  What I didn't know until years later was that she had had the same fear. She told me how she would write away for every piece of information she could find on how to prevent the fatal disease until my father made her stop. He told her she had to relax and stop worrying so much. She was going to be OK. He was right. And one October, many years into the future, we would celebrate her 90th birthday.

Now however, doctors have begun to look into laughter and the effects it has on the human body. They have found that laughter really can improve people's health. Tests were carried out to study the effects of laughter on the body. People watched funny films while doctors checked their heart, blood pressure, breathing and muscles. It was found that laughter has similar effects to physical exercise. It increases blood pressure, makes the heart beat quicker and makes people breathe deeper; it also works several groups of muscles in the face, the stomach, and even the feet. If laughter exercises the body, it must be beneficial. Other tests have shown that laughter appears to be able to reduce the effect of pain on the body. In one experiment doctors produced pain in groups of students who listened to different radio programmes. The group that tolerated   the pain for the longest time was the group which listened to a funny programme. The reason why laughter can reduce pain seems to be that it helps to produce a kind of chemical in the brain which _ both stress and pain. As a result of these discoveries, some doctors in the United States now hold laughter clinics, in which they help to improve their patients' condition by encouraging them to laugh.

But immigrations hoping to become Australian citizens will soon have to take a test examining their knowledge of the country's history and institutions. While Australia prides itself on its multicultural background, the government wants newcomers to integrate  more  fully . Form later this year, new immigrants will have to show an understanding of the English language. They will also be required to answer 20 questions from a list of 200. Anyone who gives fewer than 12 correct responses will not be accepted. Immigrants will also have to accept what the government considers to be 10 important Australia values, including \"mateship\" and \"giving people a fair go\". Other important Australia values are said to include tolerance, compassion, gender equality and freedom of speech. The new citizenship application procedures are detailed in a 40-pages booklet . It describes Australia as \"a nation at ease with the world and  itself\" but says that newcomers are expected to respect its values. The booklet sums up mateship as voluntary helping and receiving help from others, especially in difficult times.

An octopus doesn't have a backbone, which doesn't mean that they lack nerve. On the contrary, their nervous system, which goes all the way down each leg, is very complex. They are able to take in a lot of information about their world and seem to be able to remember, learn and adapt to new situations. The suckers   on their long legs can not only feel, but also taste. Each sucker works individually, so an octopus can just focus on one leg or one sucker. Their eyesight is sharp. Although their brains are quite small in comparison to ours, they still have very large brains for invertebrates  . They have many physical characteristics of a human brain. Perhaps you've seen the video of an octopus in a German aquarium that learned to open a jar to get its food. Octopuses have also been taught to go through mazes   and to pick out different shapes of patterns. Their short term and long term memory seems to be excellent. It is thought that octopuses are as intelligent as dogs in their capacity   to learn certain behavior, solve problems, and make use of objects.

An octopus doesn't have a backbone, which doesn't mean that they lack nerve. On the contrary, their nervous system, which goes all the way down each leg, is very complex. They are able to take in a lot of information about their world and seem to be able to remember, learn and adapt to new situations. The suckers   on their long legs can not only feel, but also taste. Each sucker works individually, so an octopus can just focus on one leg or one sucker. Their eyesight is sharp. Although their brains are quite small in comparison to ours, they still have very large brains for invertebrates  . They have many physical characteristics of a human brain. Perhaps you've seen the video of an octopus in a German aquarium that learned to open a jar to get its food. Octopuses have also been taught to go through mazes   and to pick out different shapes of patterns. Their short term and long term memory seems to be excellent. It is thought that octopuses are as intelligent as dogs in their capacity   to learn certain behavior, solve problems, and make use of objects. In the movie \"Octopus Intelligence: Deep Sea Aliens,\" some species of octopuses are letting young octopuses watch the adults in order to train them. If this keeps up, in a hundred thousand generations the octopus may rule the seas. Clearly, there is more to an octopus than just a lot of legs. Which of the following statements about the suckers of the octopus is true?", "subject": ""}

When historians and philosophers of science listen to these questions, some conclude that science may not be able to solve all these problems any time soon.

Because of the unstable and changing state of the earth's atmosphere, for example, scientists have struggled for centuries to predict the weather with precision  but failed.

For example, they think that the gravitational force of a nearby space vehicle, though tiny, is able to change the path of a much larger planet if the vehicle spends enough time close to it.

But no matter what one does with Easter eggs,they are an important Easter tradition throughout the Western world. People from many different cultures celebrate Easter.

Another good thing about mistakes is this:When you are making mistakes,you are learning.Consider this:Edison failed 10,000 times before he perfected the 1ight bulb.When asked how it felt to fail that many times,he said that he hadn't failed 10,000 times,but rather had learned 10,000 things that didn't work. Finally,when you make a mistake you are much closer to success.Why?Because when all is said and done,you will have tried some numbers of things before you succeed.Every time you make a mistake you eliminate one of those things and are one step closer.But this all doesn't mean that you should go ahead without considering the consequences of a mistake.Quite the contrary,when you try something new you have to be willing to set some reasonable limits so that in the event that it doesn't work out the way you want it to,you will he in a position to try again.

As one of the leading scholars of the positive psychology movement, he admits gratitude may be difficult to express. He recommends you begin by acknowledging that life is good and full of events and elements that make daily existence a wonder. Second, recognize that the source of life's goodness is more than just you. That source may be your mom, a friend, partner, child, colleague at work or play, a caregiver or God --or any combination of these. Expressing gratitude should not be a reaction.

In 2003, the country sent up the manned spacecraft Shenzhou-V. Four years later, Chang'e-I went into orbit   around the moon. In 2008 a Chinese man did the country's first spacewalk. These achievements would have been unthinkable without the contribution of Qian Xuesen, a key scientist on space programs and rocketry   of the People's Republic of China. This pioneering scientist passed away in Beijing on October 31 in 2009 at the age of 98. Once called \"the father of our space industry\", Qian began working on China's missile and space technology in 1956, when China had little technology. When asked by General Chen Geng whether the Chinese could develop their own missiles, Qian said Chinese could do anything that foreigners could. His research helped lead to the explosion of China's first atomic bomb   in1964, as well as to its first man-made satellite in 1970 and its first manned spacecraft in 2003. Qian was born in Shanghai. He graduated from  Shanghai Jiaotong University in 1934.Then he studied in the US at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology and later at the California Institute of Technology. During World WarII, Qian's research contributed to the development of rocket technology that the US military   began using in the 1940s. He was once prevented from leaving the country because it was decided that he knew too much about certain military matters. It was not until in 1955 that Qian returned to China with the help of the late premier Zhou Enlai. \"I plan to do my best to help the Chinese build a nation where they can live with dignity   and happiness, \" Qian told reporters before sailing for China in 1955.

During the first week of his stay, he went out one day to do some shopping. He came back in the late afternoon to discover that his suitcase was gone. He was extremely worried as the suitcase had all his important papers, including his passport . He reported the case to the police and then sat there, lost and lonely in strange city, thinking of the terrible troubles of getting all the paperwork organized again from a distant country while trying to settle down in a new one. Late in the evening, the phone rang. It was a stranger. He was trying to pronounce my husband's name and was asking him a lot of questions. Then he said they had found a pile of papers in their trash can that had been left out on the footpath. My husband rushed to their home to find a kind family holding all his papers and documents. Their young daughter had gone to the trash can and found a pile of unfamiliar papers. Her parents had carefully sorted them out, although they had found mainly foreign addresses on most of the documents. At last they had seen a half-written letter in the pile in which my husband had given his new telephone number to a friend.

Now, a new study suggests that coffee fans can make their drink sweeter by changing the color of their cups.

In one experiment, the white cup increased the intensity   of the coffee taste relative to the transparent cup. Then, in a second experiment, coffee drunk from the white cup was found to taste less sweet when compared to the other colored cups, while the blue cup made the coffee taste the sweetest.

A recent survey by marketing agency Rosette found that 68 percent of tablet owners use the device in the bedroom, more than in any other location. The living room took a close second place, at 63 percent, reports AdAge. com, and only 45 percent of respondents said they use their tablets on the go. But bringing devices into the bedroom is a bad idea, if quality rest is your goal. One of the most important factors of sleepiness is darkness, which signals to the brain that it's time to start speeding up production of the sleep - inducing hormone melatonin. But as the New York Times points out, in our modern world, we are exposed to light long after the sun sets. While any type of light can disturb your sleep, the blue wavelength light given off by cell phones, laptops, tablets and other gadgets is particularly troublesome. Research shows that this blue light causes alertness so decisively that it can actually be used to fight tiredness. According to the National Sleep Foundation, 95 percent of Americans use some device, whether it's a TV, laptop, cell phone or other products, within an hour of killing time. \"Artificial light exposure between dusk and the time we go to bed at night push our sleeping sense to a later hour - making it more difficult to fall asleep,\" said Charles Czeisler, Ph.

But my other children will never have the chance to know her and experience how loving and gracious she was. We often speak of \"Mommy's mommy,\" and I find myself trying to explain the illness that took her away from us. They have asked if the same could happen to me. I have always told them not to worry, but the truth is that I carry a \"faulty\" gene, BRCA1, which sharply increases my risk of developing breast cancer and ovarian  cancer. My doctors estimated that I had an 87 percent risk of breast cancer and a 50 percent risk of ovarian cancer, although the risk is different in the case of each woman. Once I knew that this was my reality, I decided to be proactive and to minimize the risk as much as I could. I started with the breasts, as my risk of breast cancer is higher than my risk of ovarian cancer, and the surgery is more complex. On April 27, I finished the three months of medical procedures. During that time I have been able to keep this private and to carry on with my work. But I am writing about it now because I hope that other women can benefit from my experience. Cancer is still a word that strikes fear into people's hearts, producing a deep sense of powerlessness. But today it is possible to find the way out through a blood test whether you are highly susceptible to breast and ovarian cancer, and then take action. My own process began on February 2. The operation took eight hours. Then I woke up with tubes in my breasts. It did feel like a scene out of a science-fiction film. But days after surgery I can be back to a normal life. There have been many advances in this procedure in the last few years, and the results can be beautiful. I wanted to write this to tell other women that the decision to have a surgery operation was not easy. But it is one I am very happy that I made. My chances of developing breast cancer have dropped from 87 percent to under 5 percent. I can tell my children that they don't need to fear they will lose me. It is a comfort that they see nothing that makes them scared. They can see my small scars and that's it. Everything else is just Mommy, the same as she always was. And they know that I love them and I will do anything to be with them as long as I can. On a personal note, I do not feel any less of a woman.

I have always told them not to worry, but the truth is that I carry a \"faulty\" gene, BRCA1, which sharply increases my risk of developing breast cancer and ovarian  cancer. My doctors estimated that I had an 87 percent risk of breast cancer and a 50 percent risk of ovarian cancer, although the risk is different in the case of each woman. Once I knew that this was my reality, I decided to be proactive and to minimize the risk as much as I could. I started with the breasts, as my risk of breast cancer is higher than my risk of ovarian cancer, and the surgery is more complex. On April 27, I finished the three months of medical procedures. During that time I have been able to keep this private and to carry on with my work. But I am writing about it now because I hope that other women can benefit from my experience. Cancer is still a word that strikes fear into people's hearts, producing a deep sense of powerlessness. But today it is possible to find the way out through a blood test whether you are highly susceptible to breast and ovarian cancer, and then take action. My own process began on February 2. The operation took eight hours. Then I woke up with tubes in my breasts. It did feel like a scene out of a science-fiction film. But days after surgery I can be back to a normal life. There have been many advances in this procedure in the last few years, and the results can be beautiful. I wanted to write this to tell other women that the decision to have a surgery operation was not easy. But it is one I am very happy that I made. My chances of developing breast cancer have dropped from 87 percent to under 5 percent. I can tell my children that they don't need to fear they will lose me. It is a comfort that they see nothing that makes them scared. They can see my small scars and that's it. Everything else is just Mommy, the same as she always was. And they know that I love them and I will do anything to be with them as long as I can. On a personal note, I do not feel any less of a woman.  For any woman reading this, I hope it helps you to know you have options. I want to encourage every woman, especially if you have a family history of breast or ovarian cancer, to seek out the information and medical experts who can help you through this aspect of your life, and to make your own informed choices. I acknowledge that there are many wonderful holistic doctors working on alternatives to surgery. My own regimen  will be posted in due course on the Web site of the Pink Lotus Breast Center. I hope that this will be helpful to other women. I choose not to keep my story private because there are many women who do not know that they might be living under the shadow of cancer. It is my hope that they, too, will be able to get gene tested, and that if they have a high risk they, too, will know that they can take measures. Life comes with many challenges. The ones that should not scare us are the ones we can take on and take control of. Which of the following is the best title of the passage?", "subject": ""}

No stockings hung at the fireplace, and for a moment she felt as much disappointed as she did long ago, when her little sock fell down because it was crammed so full of goodies. Then she remembered her mother's promise and, slipping her hand under her pillow, drew out a little red-covered book. She knew it very well, for it was that beautiful old story of the best life ever lived, and Jo felt that it was a true guidebook for any pilgrim   going on a long journey.  She woke Meg with a \"Merry Christmas,\" and asked her to see what was under her pillow. A green-covered book appeared, with the same picture inside, and a few words written by their mother, which made their one present very precious in their eyes. Presently Beth and Amy woke to find their little books also, one grey-color1ed, the other blue, and all sat looking at and talking about them, while the east grew rosy with the coming day. \"Girls,\" said Meg seriously, \"Mother wants us to read and love and mind these books, and we must begin at once. I shall keep my book on the table here and read a little every morning as soon as I wake, for I know it will do me good and help me through the day.\" Then she opened her new book and began to read. Jo put her arm round her and, leaning cheek to cheek, read also, with the quiet expression so seldom seen on her restless face. Much impressed by the pretty books and her sisters' example, the other two started reading too. And then the rooms were very still while the pages were softly turned, and the winter sunshine crept in   to touch the bright heads and serious faces with a Christmas greeting.  \"Where is Mother?\" asked Meg, as she and Jo ran down to thank her for their gifts, half an hour later. \"Your ma went straight off to see what was needed in a poor woman's home.\" Replied Hannah, who had lived with the family since Meg was born, and was considered by them all more as a friend than a servant. \"She will be back soon, I think, so fry your cakes, and have everything ready,\" said Meg, looking over the presents which were collected in a basket and kept under the sofa, ready to be produced at the proper time.\" \"There's Mother. Hide the basket, quick!\" cried Jo, as a door slammed and steps sounded in the hall. The girls rushed to the table, eager for breakfast. \"Merry Christmas, Mummy! Thank you for our books. We read some, and mean to every day,\" they all cried happily together. \"Merry Christmas, little daughters! I'm glad you began at once, and hope you will keep on. But I want to say one word before we sit down. Not far away from here lies a poor woman with a little newborn baby. Six children are huddled into one bed to keep from freezing, for they have no fire.

It is good angels come to us!\" said the poor woman, crying for joy. \"Funny angels in hoods   and mittens  ,\" said Jo, and set them to laughing.

No stockings hung at the fireplace, and for a moment she felt as much disappointed as she did long ago, when her little sock fell down because it was crammed so full of goodies. Then she remembered her mother's promise and, slipping her hand under her pillow, drew out a little red-covered book. She knew it very well, for it was that beautiful old story of the best life ever lived, and Jo felt that it was a true guidebook for any pilgrim   going on a long journey.  She woke Meg with a \"Merry Christmas,\" and asked her to see what was under her pillow. A green-covered book appeared, with the same picture inside, and a few words written by their mother, which made their one present very precious in their eyes. Presently Beth and Amy woke to find their little books also, one grey-color1ed, the other blue, and all sat looking at and talking about them, while the east grew rosy with the coming day. \"Girls,\" said Meg seriously, \"Mother wants us to read and love and mind these books, and we must begin at once. I shall keep my book on the table here and read a little every morning as soon as I wake, for I know it will do me good and help me through the day.\" Then she opened her new book and began to read. Jo put her arm round her and, leaning cheek to cheek, read also, with the quiet expression so seldom seen on her restless face. Much impressed by the pretty books and her sisters' example, the other two started reading too. And then the rooms were very still while the pages were softly turned, and the winter sunshine crept in   to touch the bright heads and serious faces with a Christmas greeting.  \"Where is Mother?\" asked Meg, as she and Jo ran down to thank her for their gifts, half an hour later. \"Your ma went straight off to see what was needed in a poor woman's home.\" Replied Hannah, who had lived with the family since Meg was born, and was considered by them all more as a friend than a servant. \"She will be back soon, I think, so fry your cakes, and have everything ready,\" said Meg, looking over the presents which were collected in a basket and kept under the sofa, ready to be produced at the proper time.\" \"There's Mother. Hide the basket, quick!\" cried Jo, as a door slammed and steps sounded in the hall. The girls rushed to the table, eager for breakfast. \"Merry Christmas, Mummy! Thank you for our books. We read some, and mean to every day,\" they all cried happily together. \"Merry Christmas, little daughters! I'm glad you began at once, and hope you will keep on. But I want to say one word before we sit down. Not far away from here lies a poor woman with a little newborn baby. Six children are huddled into one bed to keep from freezing, for they have no fire. There is nothing to eat over there, and the oldest boy came to tell me they were suffering hunger and cold. My girls, will you give them your breakfast as a Christmas present?\" They were all unusually hungry, having waited nearly an hour, and for a minute no one spoke, only a minute, for Jo exclaimed excitedly, \"I'm so glad you came before we began!\"  Then the four girls put the cream, the muffins and the buckwheat bread into a big basket. \"I thought you'd do it,\" said Mrs. March, smiling as if satisfied.\" You shall all go and help me, and when we come back we will have bread and milk for breakfast, and make it up at dinner time.\" They were soon ready, and the procession set out.

{"answer": 0, "choices": ["Films and fashion.", "Stars' fashion.", "Influential films.", "Film cultures."], "question": "My daughter went to see The Wild One recently and she commented that Marlon Brando was wearing jeans so long ago. Of course he helped set the trend, so that got me thinking about the link between films and trends in fashion. Fashion and films have gone hand in hand for long. The Wild One is a good example: it appeared in 1954, starring Brando. Dressed in a black leather motorcycle jacket, leather cap and jeans, he created a look which is still considered \"cool\" today. Everyone from Madonna to middle-aged men is seen wearing the classic leather motorcycle jacket. Another strong influence on fashion trends was Breakfast at Tiffany's, starring Audrey Hepburn. She made famous the simple black dress that looks perfect at either a cocktail party or just standing around an expensive department store like Tiffany's with a pastry and coffee in your hand, as Audrey Hepburn does in the film. She looks so elegant, wearing simple but beautiful dresses, big dark glasses and a string of pearls around her neck. Audrey Hepburn still influences women's fashion with her \"Tiffany's look\". In more modern times, the film star Uma Thurman created a major fashion trend when she appeared in the film Pulp Fiction, made in 1994. Her style was very simple. Her black trousers, crisp white shirt and hair style was copied by women in the world. Influencing fashion trends can often be about timing. The movie Memoirs of a Geisha came just in time to start a trend in Japanese fashion. It started the Chinese actress Zhang Ziyi, who wore beautiful silk kimonos , and it won an Oscar for Costume Design. Many travel companies picked up on the trend and ran \"geisha trips\" to Japan. The film has also led to a regained interest in kimonos. It is now quite common to see young Japanese women wearing kimonos not just on traditional occasions, but at various social events.

Without gravity to help circulate air, the carbon dioxide you exhale   has a tendency to form an invisible  cloud around you head. You can end up with what astronauts call a carbon-dioxide headache. Leroy Chiao, 54, an American retired astronaut after four flights, describes what happens even before you float out of your seat,\"Your inner ear thinks your're falling . Meanwhile your eyes are telling you you're standing straight.

Being 8-year-old, I am quite familiar with the rule, and I explained to my younger sister, Diane: Firstly, if you find the basket with the others' egg in it, quietly put it back and continue the hunt. Secondly, if the basket with your egg in it isn't found by fifteen minutes before church, you have to continue looking for it after church. That year I was unlucky, I didn't find my basket before church, so I spent one more hour looking for my hunt. The next Easter was a different story since I was lucky enough to find my basket first. I was jumping up and down, and staring at the big chocolate rabbit in my basket when Mom and Dad told us to get dressed. I proudly left my basket in the sun porch  before heading out of the door. After church, my sisters and brothers ran ahead, but I was pleased to walk between Mom and Dad since I'd already found my basket and huge chocolate rabbit. As I jumped up the porch steps I knew Dennis found his too, since he was laughing his head off. \"Hungry for chocolate soup? \" Dennis laughed. \"Chocolate soup?\" I was surprised. One look at Dennis pointed finger made me realize my beautiful chocolate rabbit was now a chocolate puddle . But I always think of the unforgettable Easters when I was a child.

Every so often, one of those magazines would run an article on the \"Car of the Future\". They featured unconventional styling and things like small nuclear reactors as power sources. Yet, frankly, my car doesn't do anything that my brother's Studebaker didn't do. It goes, it stops, it burns gasoline, it plays music. I still have to steer it, and it still runs into things if I don't steer it carefully. But guess what? All of these things are subject to change in the not-so-distant future. It will still go and stop, but it may not burn gasoline, I may not have to steer it, and it may be a lot better at not running into things. Airbags aren't the be-all and end-all in safety. In fact, considering the recent news about people occasionally being killed by their airbags in low-speed collisions  ,they obviously still need some development. But they aren't going away, and in fact, you can expect to see cars appearing with additional, side-impact airbags, something some European car manufacturers already offer. Better than systems to minimize   injury in the event of an accident, however, are systems that minimize the likelihood of an accident happening in the first place. Future cars may be able to eliminate many of the major causes of accidents, including drunk-driving, tailgating   and sleepiness. Cars could be equipped with sensors that can detect alcohol in a driver's system and prevent the car from being started, for example. Many accidents are caused by people following the car in front too closely. As early as next year, you'll be able to buy cars with radar-equipped control systems. If the radar determines you're closing too quickly with the car in front, it will ease up on the throttle  . For city streets, expect other radar devices that will give advance warning that the car in front of you has slowed abruptly   and you should step on the brakes-or that may even brake for you. Will cars eventually be able to drive themselves? There's no reason to think it won't be technically possible, and Mercedes is working on a system that can brake, accelerate and steer a vehicle down a highway on its own. Nobody really expects people to give up all control to their cars, but such systems could be used as failsafe systems to keep cars on the road and bring them safely to a stop even if the driver suddenly became disabled.

The U.S. has not always been a nation of right-hand rivers; earlier in its history, carriage and horse traffic traveled on the left, as it did in England. But by the late 1700s, people driving large wagons pulled by several pairs of horses began promoting a shift to the right. A driver would sit on the rear   left horse in order to wave his whip with his right hand; to see opposite traffic clearly, they traveled on the right.

Gratitude   fills your heart with the joyful feeling and allows you to fully appreciate everything that arises on your path. As you try hard to keep your focus on the present moment, you can experience the full wonder of \"here\". There are many ways to develop gratitude. Here are just a few suggestions you may wish to try: * Imagine what your life would be like if you lost all that you had. This will most surely remind you of how much you do appreciate it. * Make a list each day of all that you are grateful for, so that you can stay conscious   daily of your blessings. Do this especially when you are feeling as though you have nothing to feel grateful for. Or spend a few minutes before you go to sleep giving thanks for all that you have. * Spend time offering assistance   to those who are less fortunate than you, so that you may gain a new perspective  . What really matters is that you create a space in your consciousness for appreciation for all that you have right now, so that you may live more happily in your present moment.

The Olympics brought a lot of attention to Sochi, a city on the Black Sea, which is a popular area for vacation travelers. The area is known for its mild winters.

Olympic officials chose Sochi to host the 2014 games almost seven years ago. At that time, Russian President Vladimir Putin said the games would cost about $13 billion. Yet the actual expenses exceeded his estimate. So where did all the money go? Some observers say the high cost is partly the result of security measures. Brian Jenkins, a terrorism expert from the RAND Corporation, gave the following explanation. There were anywhere between 70,000 and 100, 000 policemen and military troops deployed around the city. The main threat came from separatist and Islamist groups from the North Caucasus, especially from Chechnya and Dagestan. One group claimed responsibility for two suicide bombings in Volgograd last December. The attacks killed more than 30 people. The city is only about 600 kilometers away from Sochi. Bruce Hoffman is a terrorism expert from Georgetown University in Washington DC. He says the increased security made Sochi a difficult target for terrorists.

At least $50 billion was spent on the 2014 Winter Games, making it the costliest Olympics in history. Seven billion dollars was spent on the 2010 Winter Games in Vancouver, Canada. Olympic officials chose Sochi to host the 2014 games almost seven years ago. At that time, Russian President Vladimir Putin said the games would cost about $13 billion. Yet the actual expenses exceeded his estimate. So where did all the money go? Some observers say the high cost is partly the result of security measures.

The main threat came from separatist and Islamist groups from the North Caucasus, especially from Chechnya and Dagestan. One group claimed responsibility for two suicide bombings in Volgograd last December. The attacks killed more than 30 people. The city is only about 600 kilometers away from Sochi. Bruce Hoffman is a terrorism expert from Georgetown University in Washington DC. He says the increased security made Sochi a difficult target for terrorists. It is thought that the terrorists' intention was to make life difficult for the Russians and to create some sort of incident that would take away the enjoyment. The last Olympians from around the world on Russian soil were in 1980. That was a year after Soviet troops invaded Afghanistan. More than sixty countries didn't take part in the Moscow Summer Games to show their anger. The terrorists might have attacked Sochi Olympics because  _", "subject": ""}
