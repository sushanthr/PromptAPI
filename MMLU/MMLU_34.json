My girls and I were rushing through the front door of the school as I yelled, \"Hurry up! The bell was about to...\" RIIIIIIIING! The girls froze and their eyes widened. My shoulders sagged . We were too late. We were often late for school last year, and every time we ran breathlessly into the attendance I heard myself making silly excuses to Beth, the long-suffering secretary: our alarm didn't go off; there was so much traffic; it was my husband's fault; the dog...I didn't know-something about the dog! As time passed by, my lying became a habit, and it raised a red flag for me. Lying - even in the form of \"harmless\" excuses - means we're ashamed. Shame is different from guilt. Healthy guilt is fair and helpful. But shame can be dangerous. Nothing ruins the connection between two people more quickly than shame and lies do. Anyone trying to live a healthy and honest life must avoid shame at any cost. I was trying to live a healthy and honest life, but my excuses were keeping me from reaching my goal. So I vowed to do something different . The next time we were late, I went to the attendance office. When Beth asked me to fill in a form with the reason for being late, I told the truth. \"These days, we are very tired and disorganized,\" I wrote. Beth looked down at that form, and the slowly looked up at me. She gave us a warm and big smile and her blue eyes twinkled. She started laughing. So did my kids and I.

It is the largest study of humor. Participants are invited to log on the laugh lab website, give a few personal details, tell their favorite jokes and judge the jokes told by other people. Their project will last for a year, and the organizers hope to finally discover the world's funniest joke. But there is also a serious purpose. The researchers want to know what people from different nations and cultures find funny. And they want to find out the differences between male's and female's sense of humor. The idea is that if we want to understand each other, we have to find out what makes us laugh. This is a subject that has long interested psychologists   and philosophers  . Most of the time, people are not completely honest. We do things that society expects us to and say things that help us get what we want. But laughing cannot be controlled. When we laugh, we tell the truth about ourselves. By December 2001 over 10,000 jokes had been submitted  . This gave the scientists enough evidence to make early conclusions. It seems that men and women do have different senses of humor, for example. \"Our findings show the major differences in the ways in which males and females use humor,\" said Dr Wiseman. \"Males use humor to appear superior (,) to others, while women are more skilled in languages and prefer word play.\" Researchers also found that there really is such a thing as a national sense of humor. The British enjoy what is usually called \"toilet humor\". But the French like their jokes short and sharp, \"You're a high priced lawyer. Will you answer two questions for $ 500?\" \"Yes. What's the second question?\" The Germans are famous for not having a sense of humor. But the survey found that German participants were more likely to find submitted jokes funny than any other nationality. Perhaps that proves the point. Is this joke funny? I don't know, but let's say yes, just to be safe. Dr Wiseman and his workmates also submitted jokes created by computer. But none of those who took part in the survey found any of them amusing. Perhaps this is relief  . Computers already seem like they can do everything. But at least they should leave the funny things to us.

The mother and the babies come out from the dens around March,  _ from a long winter and must immediately go hunting to find food to stay alive. Now, the only hunting they know is to catch seals from floating ice in the open ocean. In March, polar bear mothers and babies have to swim from the land in Spitsbergen to the edge of the polar ice cap. Normally this is a short swim, since in March the polar ice cap is very close to the land, and the polar bears, and even the babies, are good swimmers. However, last year we saw that the polar ice cap had become smaller in size due to global warming.  Swimming hundreds of miles, especially when they are hungry and have babies following them, is really hard, and many bears are dying because of starvation. The polar bear population in the Spitsbergen area was once threatened by hunters. In the 1970s, a ban on hunting was imposed  and the polar bear population has been steadily increasing from just a few hundred to about 2,000 to 3,000. This was a great success story. However, now, because of global warming, the population is again in danger. If we do not stop making so much carbon dioxide, we will lose these beautiful animals forever.    The polar bears are just one example of animals that have become endangered because of man's appetite for energy obtained by burning fossil fuels. All life on earth could be in danger unless we change our ways. What can we do? To reduce the amount of carbon dioxide in the air we must save and make energy without burning coal and oil. Instead, we can use the sun or the wind to generate electricity. We must also cut down on needless driving and turn off things that use electricity when we are not using them.

Bird Watching Equipment Some items that might make bird watching more enjoyable are binoculars ( ) , a camera, some kind of system for keeping notes, and maybe a back pack. Birders often keep lists of the birds they see along with notes about the habits. There is some great bird log software that will let you keep records on your computer. For more details on choosing binoculars see our Binocular -Optics page. Clothes If you are walking through a wooded area just wear clothes you would wear on any hike or field trip. You are best off wearing clothes with dull colors that mix into the background. Greens, browns, and grays are good. Avoid fabrics that rustle easily. Depending on the birds you are watching you may want to get rain gear, rubber boots and warm clothing. For birds such as owls that you might look for in the evening a strong flashlight is also handy. Choosing a Bird Field Guide Take a good field guide to identify birds. Look for clear color pictures that make it easy to recognize one bird from another. Next to each picture should be detailed descriptions of each bird's anatomy, habits, and what it eats. The guide should have information about what habitat each species uses. Many guides have maps showing the range of different birds along with their migration patterns. Where and When to see Birds Learning the habitats of birds in your area will increase the number of birds you see, and make  your birding more enjoyable. If you know that Meadow larks are likely to be in open grassy areas, and  dippers are forage along stream beds, you may be looking for them if you are in those types of  habitats. Edge areas where different types of habitats meet will likely have more species in them. You  are more likely to see specific birds at certain times of the day. For example songbirds are easier to see  two to three hours after dawn, or just before sunset. This is when songbirds are most actively feeding.  Many small birds will be silent or even hidden during the rest of the day. After sunup is the best time to see eagles and hawks. Visibility is best for hunting at this time, and they can soar on the thermal currents from the warmed air. Birds like owls are more likely to be seen in the evening. Many  shorebirds and waders rest at high tide and feed when the water rises or falls. Photographing Birds Patience in Bird Photography Most birds are afraid of people, and all species have their own comfort zone. With a little  time you can learn the comfort zone of the birds you are photographing. Once they know that you  are not a threat you may be able to get closer.

Where and When to see Birds Learning the habitats of birds in your area will increase the number of birds you see, and make  your birding more enjoyable. If you know that Meadow larks are likely to be in open grassy areas, and  dippers are forage along stream beds, you may be looking for them if you are in those types of  habitats. Edge areas where different types of habitats meet will likely have more species in them. You  are more likely to see specific birds at certain times of the day. For example songbirds are easier to see  two to three hours after dawn, or just before sunset. This is when songbirds are most actively feeding.  Many small birds will be silent or even hidden during the rest of the day. After sunup is the best time to see eagles and hawks. Visibility is best for hunting at this time, and they can soar on the thermal currents from the warmed air. Birds like owls are more likely to be seen in the evening. Many  shorebirds and waders rest at high tide and feed when the water rises or falls. Photographing Birds Patience in Bird Photography Most birds are afraid of people, and all species have their own comfort zone. With a little  time you can learn the comfort zone of the birds you are photographing. Once they know that you  are not a threat you may be able to get closer. Type or Style Your reason for photographing birds may determine your style and the kind of equipment you  use. If you are just recording the kinds of birds you see you don't need to get as close, and you  can use less expensive equipment, then you need for high quality prints. Photographing Birds in Flight Photographing birds in flight can be fun. Many digital cameras have a tracking function. With these you focus on the bird, and then as you track it the lens will keep focus. Use Your Yard Choose an open area where the birds will get direct sunlight, showing off their magnificent colors. Try using props Birds will often land on a stick or post near a seed feeder before going to the feeder. The background was just an out of focus fence but you can use anything you want for a background, and then wait for a bird to perch.

The Obama administration has labeled college as \"the ticket to the middle class\", and political leaders all have praised higher education as the best way to improve economic opportunity.       Yet despite such advice, total college enrollment   has fallen by 1.5% since 2012. What's causing the decline? While a shortage of birth in the mid-1990s accounts for some of the shift, big foreign enrollment makes up for that lack. The answer is simple: The benefits of a degree are declining while costs rise.      A key measure of the benefits of a degree is the college graduate's earning potential and on this score, their advantage over high-school graduates is fading. Since 2006, the gap between what the median college graduate earned, compared with the median high-school graduate, has narrowed by $1,387 for men over 25 working full time, a 5% fall, women in the same category worse, losing 7% of their income advantage. A college degree's declining value is even more noticeable for younger Americans. According to data collected by the College Board, for those in the 25-34 age range the difference between college graduate and high school graduate earnings fell 11% for men, to $18,303 from $20,623.

In the late 1960s, people found out that the increase in the use of cars led to many  problems. There were always too many cars for the highway system, and terrible traffic problems  developed. People were spending hours in traffic jams getting to and from work every day. In  addition, the air in many cities became dirty because of pollution from millions of cars, and many  people died in traffic accidents. As people began to get worried about how the use of cars was  hurting the environment,  cities began to spend more money on public transportation again,  so  fewer people would have to drive cars.       When gas became very expensive in the mid-1970s, the number of people taking public transportation  began to increase .It's terribly expensive to build new public transportation systems. so it's very difficult to make big changes in the way people travel .However ,an increase in the use of public transportation has begun.

Mothers and Fathers Play Differently Fathers tend to play with,and mothers tend to care for,children.While both mothers and fathers are physical,fathers are physical in different ways. Fathers are rough while mothers are gentle.Fathers encourage competition;mothers encourage equity.One style encourages independence while the other encourages security. Both provide security and confidence in their own ways by communicating love and physical intimacy. Fathers Push Limits;Mothers Encourage Security Go to any playground and listen to the parents.Who is encouraging their kids to swing or climb just a little higher,ride just a little faster,throw just a little harder?Who is yelling,\"Slow down,not so high,not so hard\"?Of course,fathers encourage children to take chances and push limits and mothers protect children and are more cautious. Joined together,they keep each other in balance and help children remain safe while expanding their experiences and confidence. Mothers and Fathers Communicate Differently A major study found that when speaking to children,mothers and fathers are different.Mothers will simplify their words and speak on the child's level.Men are not as inclined to modify  their language for the child simply. Children who do not have the chance to meet both will not learn how to understand and use both styles of conversation as they grow. These boys and girls will be at a disadvantage because they will experience these different ways of communicating in relationship with teachers,bosses and others. Mothers and Fathers Discipline Differently Educational psychologist Carol Gilligan tells us that fathers stress justice,fairness and duty,while mothers stress sympathy,care and help.Again,either of these parenting styles by themselves is not good,but together,they create a healthy,proper balance.

Each tribe that Jesse worked with wanted him to commit to one or the other. Jesse would not surrender to tribalism when he took an African name, and he wanted a tribal last name.

Often we believe that our child will pick up on our values if they live in the same home. While they may pick up many of our values, parents need to remember they are not the only influence in their child's life. These outside values often compete with family values for your child's attention. If we do not make a conscious  effort to _ our children, they may not get instilled at all. I wish I had learned that lesson a little earlier. I thought if I lived my values for my children they would pick them up and make their own. Sometimes this happened and sometimes it didn't. I often see twenty-something \"kids\" who have no faith in many of the values of their family in favor of the values of their friends. Children will often pick up the negative you show quicker than the positive, so the positive things need extra focus to set them. Some of the influences your children face every day include their church, their school, their friends, any clubs or sporting groups they are part of and more. Kids spend many hours a day at school and with their friends. Sometimes in the business of life, we suppose our children will obtain that foundation we want for them. Instilling a foundation of family values to sustain  your child requires more than living it in front of them. That is important, but building up your child with this important foundation must become intentional. That means we plan times to gather as a family. We plan activities together that show the values we want to pass on. We talk about our values; we live our values; we discuss the values of others and how they differ from ours; we constantly look for opportunities and make our own opportunities to share these values in word or deed with our children. Family values give our children a foundation to build upon. It helps them know they are loved and gives them a sense of belongings.

Online schools receive the same amount of funding as all other public schools, even though they don't have to pay for rent or school equipment. States should use their educational funds to improve education at real schools, not to support online programs. Some students only use online classes to supplement their school work. They benefit from the social experience of a traditional high school, while still taking online courses. However, about 90 thousand students in America receive their education only from online schools. 50 thousand of these students take courses at Florida Virtual School, the largest online school in the country. While this method of schooling helps students who live in remote regions, most school systems are upset that they are losing more students each year to these online programs. Although online learning allows children to work at their own pace, these online schools have only one teacher per several hundred students. Often, teachers can't give struggling students the help they need as they are unable to talk face-to-face with them, to find exactly what they're having difficulty with. Additionally, even though online schooling accommodates   students who live in more remote states, students in online programs may suffer in social situations because they will not learn valuable communication skills from their schooling. Similar to students who are home schooled, those who take only online classes won't learn social etiquette  , and will be treated differently by their peers.

{"answer": 3, "choices": ["They like difficult tasks.", "They don't care about costs.", "They are too young to tell right from wrong.", "They care a lot about what their peers think of them."], "question": "Having a teenager at home can be a real headache. Many teenagers smoke, drink and even fight. They often do something dangerous. Earlier studies have shown that teenagers are more likely   to make _ decisions than people from any other age group, including children and adults. Is it that teenagers are too young to tell right from wrong? Not really. So what's the reason? According to Laurence, a teacher from a US university, the reason is that teenagers care a lot about how their peers   view them--that is \"peer influence\". As children enter their teenage years, they spend more time with their friends and classmates, and also they care more about what they think of them. This makes teenagers make decisions without thinking about the costs. In a test, a group of teenagers were asked to play a video driving game. When they played with their friends watching around them, they took more chances and drove more carelessly because that would increase their possibility of winning. But when they played alone, they drove more safely. Why do peers have such a big influence on teens' behavior? As Laurence sees it, a teenager's brain is like a car with a good accelerator   but a weak brake  . The \"accelerator\" is fully developed by teenage years while the \"brake\" is still not fully developed. When teenagers are watched by their peers, they usually push hard on the accelerator. With their weak brake, it is likely that they are going to end up in an accident. But the good news is that a violent  teenager doesn't necessarily become a violent adult. About two-thirds to three-quarters of violent youth grow out of it. \"They get more self-controlled.\" Why are teenagers likely to make wrong decisions according to the text?", "subject": ""}

But when they played alone, they drove more safely. Why do peers have such a big influence on teens' behavior? As Laurence sees it, a teenager's brain is like a car with a good accelerator   but a weak brake  . The \"accelerator\" is fully developed by teenage years while the \"brake\" is still not fully developed. When teenagers are watched by their peers, they usually push hard on the accelerator. With their weak brake, it is likely that they are going to end up in an accident. But the good news is that a violent  teenager doesn't necessarily become a violent adult. About two-thirds to three-quarters of violent youth grow out of it. \"They get more self-controlled.\" According to the text, with peers around them, teenagers are more likely to   _   .", "subject": ""}

{"answer": 3, "choices": ["income and expense", "invention and production", "market and society", "supply and demand"], "question": "Supply and demand is perhaps one of the most basic concepts of economics and it is the backbone of a market economy. Demand refers to how much of a product or service is desired by buyers. The quantity demanded is the amount of a product people are willing to buy at a certain price; the relationship between price and quantity demanded is known as the demand relationship. Supply represents how much the market can offer. The quantity supplied refers to the amount of a certain goods producers are willing to supply when receiving a certain price. The relationship between price and how much of a goods or service is supplied to the market is known as the supply relationship. Price, therefore, is a reflection of supply and demand.    The law of demand states that, if all other factors remain equal, the higher the price of a product, the fewer people will demand that product. The amount of goods that buyers purchase at a higher price is less as the price of a product goes up, so does the opportunity cost of buying that product.    Like the law of demand, the law of supply shows the quantities that will be sold at a certain price. But unlike the law of demand, the supply relationship shows an upward slope. This means that the higher the price, the higher the quantity supplied. Producers supply more at a higher price because selling a higher quantity at a higher price increases the whole income.    Now that we know the laws of supply and demand, let's turn to an example to show how supply and demand affect price.    Imagine that a CD of your favorite band is sold for $20. Because the record company's previous analysis showed that consumers will not demand CDs at a price higher than $20, only ten CDs were sold because the opportunity cost is too high for suppliers to produce more. If, however, the ten CDs are demanded by 20 people, the price will then rise. As a result, the rise in price should cause more CDs to be supplied as the supply relationship shows that the higher the price, the higher the quantity supplied. If, however, there are 30 CDs produced and demand is still at 20, the price will not be pushed up because the supply is more than the demand.

Growing up, she was a quiet and serious girl. She spent a lot of time playing with her dolls. She would pretend that the dolls were sick and she was their nurse.

Florence really wanted to be a doctor but she couldn't because in those days only men were allowed to become doctors. She decided that she wanted to become a nurse. Her parents were very angry;the daughters of rich people did not work at all and certainly they did not become nurses. But Florence had made up her mind to specialize in nursing.      Her chance came in 1854 when Britain went to war with Russia in a place called the Crimea. Florence was asked to take a group of nurses to look after the sick and wounded soldiers. The hospitals were dirty, and there was not enough medicine. There were not enough beds, so some people were just lying on rags in the mud. There was so much sickness that the doctors could not treat all the soldiers. Florence and her team cleaned the hospital rooms and beds. They made sure that the soldiers got enough medicine. The army was unhappy because there were women so close to the fighting. They gave the nurses a lot of trouble.

Major record companies accused the students of fueling music piracy  by running file-sharing networks on campus allowing hundreds of songs to be downloaded for free. Last Thursday, the four promised not to violate the companies' copyrights. Although they did not admit any wrongdoing, they each agreed to pay thousands of dollars to the Recording Industry Association of America (RIAA). \"I don't believe that I did anything wrong,\" said Daniel Peng at prefix = st1 /PrincetonUniversity, one of the four. \"I hope that for the sake of artists, the larger issues can soon be resolved.\" None appears to have made any money off the file-sharing systems they operated, which were confined to their campus's computer networks. The payments mark the first time record companies have recovered money from individuals in the USaccused of piracy on file-sharing networks. This may be a sign of things to come, as the industry starts taking its battle against online piracy directly to users. Many record-company executives  blame the long slump in CD sales on file-sharing networks, which let users copy songs from each other's computers for free. Matt Oppenheim, senior vice president of business and legal affairs for the RIAA, said the settlements, although well below what the companies could have asked for, were \"the right amount\" given the situation. He also noted that since the four lawsuits were filed, at least 18 campus file-sharing networks have been taken down by their operators. What's the main idea of the whole passage?", "subject": ""}

{"answer": 3, "choices": ["be a valuable food source for animals", "survive the fierce storms in summer", "provide seeds and oil", "be useful in many aspects"], "question": "Farmers may not be able to prevent natural disasters, but they can at least try their best to reduce losses.  For example, they can plant crops that are more likely to survive extreme weather. In north-central Vietnam, people with small farms do not plant rice between September and December. Seasonal rains might destroy the rice. So instead, they plant lotus seeds on raised beds. The United Nations Food and Agriculture Organization says the lotus seeds  _ . Farmers in the Philippines are showing new interest in crops like winged beans, string beans, arrowroot and cassava. The Asian Disaster Preparedness Center says traditional crops like these can survive the fierce storms that often strike the islands.  The United Nations says some African farmers grow bambara groundnuts during long dry periods. The seeds of this drought-resistant plant can be boiled for eating or for making flour.  In some parts of the world, farmers grow vetiver grass. Researchers in Thailand wrote about vetiver in 2007 in the journal Science Asia. They noted that the grass can absorb and control the spread of harmful waste waters, like those from pig farms. Agricultural expert and author William Rivera says vetiver resists difficult conditions. It reduces damage from heavy rains. And vetiver planted on earthen dams may strengthen them against breaks and flooding.  William Rivera also speaks approvingly of alfalfa. Its deep roots can find and take up groundwater. Those roots also help hold the soil against winds. And alfalfa can be a valuable food source for animals.

For example, they can plant crops that are more likely to survive extreme weather. In north-central Vietnam, people with small farms do not plant rice between September and December. Seasonal rains might destroy the rice. So instead, they plant lotus seeds on raised beds. The United Nations Food and Agriculture Organization says the lotus seeds  _ . Farmers in the Philippines are showing new interest in crops like winged beans, string beans, arrowroot and cassava. The Asian Disaster Preparedness Center says traditional crops like these can survive the fierce storms that often strike the islands.  The United Nations says some African farmers grow bambara groundnuts during long dry periods. The seeds of this drought-resistant plant can be boiled for eating or for making flour.  In some parts of the world, farmers grow vetiver grass. Researchers in Thailand wrote about vetiver in 2007 in the journal Science Asia. They noted that the grass can absorb and control the spread of harmful waste waters, like those from pig farms. Agricultural expert and author William Rivera says vetiver resists difficult conditions. It reduces damage from heavy rains. And vetiver planted on earthen dams may strengthen them against breaks and flooding.  William Rivera also speaks approvingly of alfalfa. Its deep roots can find and take up groundwater. Those roots also help hold the soil against winds. And alfalfa can be a valuable food source for animals.

So it is with all of our relationships.The trust factor is vital for relationships to develop.Think of one of your fondest memories, and you will no doubt find a remarkable relationship at its center--one with a spiritual quality that shines outward from the heart. Time together, caring acts, and unconditional love build trust.I suggest that we each spend plenty of time with our personal \"Pinoechio lamps\"--those special ways that we choose to strengthen our relationships. Relationships take time to develop and maintain.It is not always easy, but the results are priceless.\"Nights by a Pinoechio lamp\", wherever those might be for you, will create enduring relationships of golden \"life stuff\", spiritual gifts that no one can take away.

The mission will accomplish the first spacewalk by Chinese astronauts. \"All the major systems involved in the launching are now in the final preparation. The main tests for the spacecraft, the Long-March II-F rocket, suits for the space walk and a satellite accompanying the fly have also been finished, \" said the spokesman. In addition, the ground control system is fully prepared, including the launch site, the landing site, and the communication for observation and control. When Shenzhou-7 enters its orbit, one of the three taikonauts will conduct a space walk, said Zhao Changxi, a senior scientist with the project, earlier. According to Zhao, cameras would be fixed outside and inside of the ship for live broadcasting of the space walk. While the last mission of Shenzhou-6, with a crew of two, was aimed at several days of manned flight, this time the task might be more stringent as one of its main goals is the space walk. Earlier reports said a crew of six astronauts had been chosen for the mission, with three manning the spacecraft and three substitutes.

It was guessed that the mummy might have been hidden in the tomb for safekeeping because her stepson and successor  , Tuthmosis III, tried to wipe out her memory. Hatshepsut stole the power from her young stepson. After her death, records were destroyed and her body was dug out. It can be inferred from the passage that   _  .", "subject": ""}

Globally, pollution was linked to one death in eight in 2012, new WHO research found. The biggest pollution-related killers were heart disease, stroke, pulmonary disease and lung cancer. The hardest-hit regions of the globe were what the WHO labels Southeast Asia, which includes India and Indonesia, and the Western Pacific, ranging from China and South Korea to Japan and the Philippines. Together, they accounted for 5.9 million deaths. The global death toll included 4.3 million deaths due to indoor air pollution, chiefly caused by cooking over coal, wood and biomass stoves. The toll from outdoor pollution was 3.7 million, with sources ranging from coal heating fires to diesel engines. Many people are exposed to both indoor and outdoor pollution, the WHO said, and due to that overlap the separate death toll attributed to the two sources cannot simply be added together, hence the figure of seven million deaths. The new figure is \"shocking and worrying\", Ms Neira told reporters. When it last released an estimate for deaths related to air pollution, in 2008, the agency had put the figure related to outdoor pollution at 1.3 million, while the number blamed on indoor pollution was 1.9 million. But a change in research methods makes comparison difficult between the 2008 estimate and the 2012 figures, Neira said. In the past, for example, the WHO did not take into account the overlap between exposure to both forms, and only assessed urban pollution. Satellite imagery has made it easier to assess rural pollution, and new knowledge about the health impact of exposure has enabled a better count. \"The risks from air pollution are now far greater than previously thought or understood, particularly for heart disease and strokes,\" said Neira.  \"Few risks have a greater impact on global health today than air pollution. The evidence signals the need for concerted action to clean up the air we all breathe.\" According to the WHO, some 2.9 billion people in poor nations live in homes that use fires as their principle method of cooking and heating.

He also said transport policies needed a shake-up. With air pollution having sparked a recent scare in France, leading to restrictions on car use and the temporary scrapping of public transport fees in Paris, Mr Dora said such measures could be applied in the longer term. \"You can't buy clean air in a bottle,\" he said.\"The air is a shared resource.

The study, which began with a self-administered questionnaire taken between 1983 and 1989, asked more than 80,000 radiologic technologists aged 22 t0 92 questions about age, height, weight and smoking behavior. BMI (body mass index) was calculated, with a BMI of 30 t0 34.9 being considered obese, and 35 and over being very obese. Smoking behavior was analyzed by looking at a person's tobacco consumption level, number of years smoked, and current smoking status. Researchers then followed participants through December of 2002, noting the number of deaths that occurred. The study involved researchers from the National Cancer Institute, the University of Minnesota and the American Registry of Radiolegic Technologists. Key Findings: 20 percent of obese adults in the United States smoke. Obese smokers face a greater risk of death from cancer and circulatory disease. Current smoking is a greater risk factor for death by cancer than obesity is, generally speaking. The higher a person's pack-years (number of packs smoked per day times the number of years smoked) are, the greater the risk of death. Men and women of all ages faced an elevated risk of death due to circulatory disease as BMI increased. And for those who were both obese and currently smoking, risk of circulatory disease increased 6 to 11 times under the age of 65, as compared to their never-smoking, normal weight counterparts. While it's not surprising that obesity coupled with smoking is a recipe for trouble, it is important to highlight this growing health concern in America today. Taking Charge of Your Health Making healthy choices can be difficult when we're constantly bombarded with products that are hazardous to our health, but it's not impossible.

The study, which began with a self-administered questionnaire taken between 1983 and 1989, asked more than 80,000 radiologic technologists aged 22 t0 92 questions about age, height, weight and smoking behavior. BMI (body mass index) was calculated, with a BMI of 30 t0 34.9 being considered obese, and 35 and over being very obese. Smoking behavior was analyzed by looking at a person's tobacco consumption level, number of years smoked, and current smoking status. Researchers then followed participants through December of 2002, noting the number of deaths that occurred. The study involved researchers from the National Cancer Institute, the University of Minnesota and the American Registry of Radiolegic Technologists. Key Findings: 20 percent of obese adults in the United States smoke. Obese smokers face a greater risk of death from cancer and circulatory disease. Current smoking is a greater risk factor for death by cancer than obesity is, generally speaking. The higher a person's pack-years (number of packs smoked per day times the number of years smoked) are, the greater the risk of death. Men and women of all ages faced an elevated risk of death due to circulatory disease as BMI increased. And for those who were both obese and currently smoking, risk of circulatory disease increased 6 to 11 times under the age of 65, as compared to their never-smoking, normal weight counterparts. While it's not surprising that obesity coupled with smoking is a recipe for trouble, it is important to highlight this growing health concern in America today.

Humans developed on a planet with a surface that is more than 70 percent water. Our bodies are also about 70 percent water. When there is no gravity that water moves up toward the head, raising pressure in the skull. Arms and legs grow weaker at what is called zero gravity because they no longer need to push against the force of gravity.

The research also showed that the right eye was affected more than the left, and that men were more affected than women. Scientists could not find an explanation for the differences. Bone loss was one of the problems first reported by astronauts returning to Earth after longer stays in space. So scientists designed exercise machines to use on the space station.

Some British scientists have recently solved this mystery. It turns out that roots have special hairs that tie them into the soil and help them grow their way past obstacles, a team at the John Inners Center in Norwich reports in the February 29 issue of Journal Science. \"The key is in the fuzzy coat of hairs on the roots of plants,\" says professor Liam Dolan. \"We have found a growth control system that enables these hairs to find their way and to become longer when their path is clear.\" Root hairs explore the soil in much the same way a person would feel their way in the dark. If they come across an obstacle, they make their way around until they can continue growing in an opening. In the meantime, the plant is held in place as the hairs grip the soil. The hairs are guided by a clever chemical trick. A protein  at the tip of the root hairs called RHD2 helps them to take calcium  from the soil. Calcium makes the hairs grow, and produce more RHD2, and take more calcium. But when an obstacle blocks the hair's path, or the hair reaches the surface of the soil, the cycle is broken and growth starts in another direction. This system gives plants the flexibility to explore a complex environment and to live in even the most unpromising soils, says Dolan. In poor soils such as in parts of Australia and Africa, native plants have adapted by producing enormous numbers of root hairs. A better understanding of this adaptation will allow scientists to develop hairy rooted crops that can grow in unfriendly environments.

She was a quiet, well-behaved girl and she did not understand why the girls had approached her. They showed her some of the things they had stolen and said that shop theft was great fun and very exciting. Then they threatened to beat Ann if she did not join them. Ann was deeply troubled. She did her best to avoid the group of the girls after classes, but they often waited for her outside the school and tried to persuade her to come with them. This problem is one which many school students in Hong Kong face. We asked the chairman  of the local-fight-crime committee  what Ann should do in these cases. \"First of all, she could try to _ .

Jet lag results from flying long distances in an airplane. Jet lag interferes with a person's normal times for sleeping and waking. People with jet lag may feel extremely tired for several days. They also may have problems thinking clearly and remembering. Kwangwook Cho is a researcher at the University of Bristol in Britain. He reported the findings of his jet lag study in the publication Nature Neuroscience. The study involved twenty young women who worked for international airlines. The women had served passengers on airplanes for five years. These flight attendants flew across many countries and at least seven time zones. In the study, the flight attendants had different amounts of time to recover from jet lag. Half the women spent five days or fewer in their home areas between long flights. The other half spent more than fourteen days in their home areas. Mister Cho took some fluid from the women's mouths to measure levels of a hormone that increases during stress. He tested them to see if they could remember where black spots appeared on a computer screen. And he took pictures of their brains using magnetic resonance imaging. This is a way to measure the size of the brain's temporal lobes. It was found that the women who had less time between flights had smaller right temporal lobes. This area of the brain deals with recognizing and remembering what is seen. The same group performed worse and had slower reaction times on the visual memory test. And their saliva samples showed higher levels of stress hormones. Mister Cho says he believes the brain needs at least ten days to recover after a long trip. He says airline workers told him their ability to remember got worse after working on planes for about four years. Other studies have shown that increased feelings of stress can cause a loss of cells in the part of the brain that controls memory.

Another study conducted by UCLA found that \"people evaluate one another by using the three V's: visual (appearance), vocal (voice) and verbal (what you say).\" Before you head out on your next date to meet someone new, let's concentrate on these areas: *How others will see you. (Visual) Are you dressed well? Do you look like this date is important to you? Did you take some time with your appearance? Watch your manners: people don't like bad manners. *How others will hear you. (Vocal) Is your voice too soft? You might come across as insecure. If you speak softly, make an effort to speak clearly -- don't make your date have to work to hear you. *What others will hear you say. (Verbal) People have a natural desire to connect -- let them know you're interested in what they have to say by repeating it back to them. Don't say the same thing everyone else is saying.

Like Jeon, there are countless numbers of first generation Asian-Americans who make great efforts to go beyond at everything. Yet the children themselves cannot all be put to blame for their efforts.

It was roughly around 8:00 p.m. when I decided to take a dip in the pool after dinner. I jumped into the pool that was already spotted with a few Chinese children and I hadn't realized what was going on until I took notice of the parents calling out orders and instructing their children. I saw various children all under the age of 10 taking laps across the pool trying various styles. If a child's foot was too bent, her parent would demand that she straighten it. If a child was kicking too slowly, his parent would order that he go faster.

The message surfaced in White Lake in late April, just days after the 11th anniversary of its being thrown into the lake. It was found by one of Baker's closest friends, Steve Lieder, she said. Lieder and two friends were chatting near the lake when Lieder looked down and saw the bottle. He broke it open and found the note inside. \"My name is Joshua Baker. I am 10. If you find this, put it on the news. The date is 4/16/98.\" They immediately took it to Holbrook, who said she is now having the note preserved and will display it in her home. She can remember when her son wrote the message for the school project.

Salman Khan's voice is heard every day on the net -- by tens of thousands of students around the world who are hungry for help learning math. He has posted 1,200 lessons on You Tube --lessons that appear on an electronic blackboard, which range from basic addition to advanced mathematics for science and finance. And they are free. Khan lives in Silicon Valley, with his wife, a doctor, and their new baby. He got the idea for his \"Khan Academy\" four years ago, when he taught a young cousin how to convert kilograms to grams.

My brother, mother and I live in a very rural district on the Big Island of Hawaii. Our farm is at least a dozen miles from the most basic of services.

As I settled into my seat, I glanced down at the roadside, when a piece of paper caught my eye. I picked it up and read it carefully. Instantly, I was grateful I did. The form turned out to be a receipt from the State Motor Vehicle Division, documenting the owners' payment of their Vehicle's Registration fees. Quickly, I put myself in their shoes and figured: no one would throw this out, especially if it was current. I also looked over the form for contact or any personal data, perhaps a license tag or telephone number. But that seemed impractical. Although the form had been born on the wind, where in the busy, crowded parking lot would I find the owners? Had it been lying there for a few minutes or a week? So I checked the date, the fees paid, noted the names of the owners and pocketed the receipt.

Further, I imagined how crazy I'd be if I had misplaced my receipt. Much easier to attempt returning it than to leave them angry, upset, etc. over the loss. By the end of the week, I received a beautiful thank-you letter from a very grateful and happy couple containing a hand written message and a gift card to use at any Starbuck's. In her note, the wife explained how a gust of wind snatched their receipt from a pocket in her car's passenger door. They had panicked and searched crazily for quite some time before giving up.

For many people the answer is simple. They go online to a search engine like Google or Yahoo. But what about people in rural or underdeveloped areas who may have no way to get on the Internet? Luckily, Rose Shuman, a business and international development consultant in California, has found a way for them. Her amazing solution is \"Question Box\". Question Box is a service that provides answers--free of charge--for people who cannot search the Internet directly. They might not be able to read, or they simply have no access. Question Box began two years ago in India.People use a metal call box with a pushtotalk button to connect to a live operator, as Rose Shuman explains, \"You just push a button, a big green button, and that will connect you directly to our operators who are sitting in front of computers, and speak your language. And you can ask them any sort of question you want, and they'll look it up in English or in Hindi, or whatever the main language is, and translate the answer right back for you.\" The service is currently offered in two villages. The latest version of the box uses mobile phone technology and solar panels in case the electrical power fails. Rose Shuman says the aim was to make the box as easy as possible for users. \"Rather than try to bring a lot of infrastructure to them and expect them to learn how to use the Internet, the idea was to make a technology that even Grandma could use, figuring that Grandma could probably walk up to a box and push a button,\" added Shuman.  In April, Question Box expanded to Uganda.Forty community workers with mobile phones connect villagers to call center operators in Kampala.The community workers go around telling people about the service. They wear Tshirts that say \"Ask Me.\"  But Internet service in Uganda proved slow and undependable. So Question Box teamed up with a local technology company to store information on a local server. That way, the researchers in Kampala can quickly search the database for answers when users ask about current events and many other subjects. Rose Shuman continued, \"When was Mahatma Gandhi born and how long is the Nile River? What's the tallest mountain? The funniest one I think we got was, 'Did the pyramids ever move to another place?', which we found pretty funny.

For many people the answer is simple. They go online to a search engine like Google or Yahoo. But what about people in rural or underdeveloped areas who may have no way to get on the Internet? Luckily, Rose Shuman, a business and international development consultant in California, has found a way for them. Her amazing solution is \"Question Box\". Question Box is a service that provides answers--free of charge--for people who cannot search the Internet directly. They might not be able to read, or they simply have no access. Question Box began two years ago in India.People use a metal call box with a pushtotalk button to connect to a live operator, as Rose Shuman explains, \"You just push a button, a big green button, and that will connect you directly to our operators who are sitting in front of computers, and speak your language. And you can ask them any sort of question you want, and they'll look it up in English or in Hindi, or whatever the main language is, and translate the answer right back for you.\" The service is currently offered in two villages.

{"answer": 3, "choices": ["It was floating in space forever.", "It flew into heavy clouds.", "It returned to the Earth.", "It fell onto Venus."], "question": "Scientists know of more than 1,000 volcanoes on the surface of Venus, Earth's \"sister\" planet. A big question has been: Are they still active? The scientists say yes. Their evidence for recent volcanic activity on Venus comes from a lava  flow in the planet's northern hemisphere. The flow is hotter than the rocks around, which means the lava might still be cooling off. \"The flow we studied seems to be very young---it is still warm inside,\" Nataliya Bondarenko said. Venus is a difficult planet to study from Earth because it is surrounded by thick clouds. Telescopes on Earth can't see through these clouds, so the best information about Venus comes from spacecraft orbiting it. Bondarenko and her colleagues studied the lava flow using data from NASA's Magellan mission. That spacecraft spent four years in orbit around Venus and used radar to make a map of 98 percent of the planet's surface. On October 11th, 1994, the mission ended, and the spacecraft plunged   through Venus' heavy cloud cover and crashed onto the planet below. While in orbit, the Magellan craft sent microwaves, which can go through Venus' clouds, to the surface. Microwaves are invisible and can be as long as three feet. These waves are a kind of energy, like light. And like light, they bounce off surfaces. The way the waves bounced off the Venus' surface and back to the craft supplied information that the scientists used to estimate the temperature of various parts of the planet's surface. Bondarenko's team found that the lava flow was hotter than its surroundings---which may mean the lava flow is in the process of cooling. The scientists say the lava flow can't be very old because if it were, it would have cooled off enough that Magellan wouldn't have noticed the difference in microwaves.

While it is generally taken as an indicator of their marital   status, the practice is primarily related to the Hindu religion. The dot goes by different names in different Hindi dialects, and \"bindi\" is the one that is most commonly known. Traditionally, the dot carries no gender restriction: Men as well as women wear it. However, the tradition of men wearing it has faded in recent times, so nowadays we see a lot more women than men wearing one. The position of the bindi is standard: center of the forehead, close to the eyebrows. It represents a third, or inner eye. Hindu tradition holds that all people have three eyes: The two outer ones are used for seeing the outside world, and the third one is there to focus inward toward God. As such, the dot serves as a constant reminder to keep God in the front of a believer's thoughts. Red is the traditional color of the dot. It is said that in ancient times a man would place a drop of blood between his wife's eyes to seal their marriage. According to Hindu beliefs, the color red is believed to bring good fortune to the married couple. Today, people go with different colors depending upon their preferences. Women often wear dots that match the color of their clothes.

This August the Oxford dictionary added the word to their online dictionary and defined it as: \"A photograph that one has taken of oneself, typically with a smartphone or webcam and up-loaded to a social media website.\" Today it's not difficult to find social networking pages full of photos people have taken of themselves and their friends. And selfie culture has become especially relevant for young people.

So what are the reasons for the rise of selfie culture? \"The cult   of the selfie celebrates regular people,\" Pamela Rutledge, a professor at the Massachusetts School of Professional Psychology, told Vogue magazine. \"There are many more photographs available now of real people than models.\" Posting selfies also allows you to control your image online. \"I like having the power to choose how I look, even if I'm making a funny face,\" Samantha Barks, 19, a high school student in the US, told Vogue. In addition to self-expression and documentation, selfies \"allow of a close friendship for long-distance friends, because you can see each other's faces every day\", wrote Casey Miller at The Huffmgton Post. But US psychologist Jill Weber is concerned that selfies might lead to social problems, \"There's a danger that your self-esteem may start to be tied to the comments and 'likes' you get when you post a selfie, and they aren't based on who you are -- they're based on what you look like,\" Weber told Vogue. \"When you get nothing or a negative response, your confidence can _ .\" What is Jill Weber's attitude toward selfies?", "subject": ""}

Previous research suggests that the ability to control energy intake may be affected by the speed at which we eat, and a high eating rate may damage the relationship between the sensory signals and processes that control how much we eat. In order to learn more about the link between eating speed and energy intake, researchers examined how eating speed affects calories consumed during a meal in both normal-weight subjects as well as overweight or obese subjects. In the new study, a group of normal-weight subjects and a group of overweight or obese subjects were asked to consume two meals in a controlled environment. All subjects ate one meal slowly, took small bites, chewed thoroughly, and paused and put the spoon down between bites, and ate a second meal quickly, took large bites, chewed quickly, and did not pause and put the spoon down. At the conclusion of the study, the researchers found only normal-weight subjects had a statistically significant reduction in caloric consumption by eating slowly. \"A lack of statistical significance in the overweight and obese group may be partly due to the fact that they consumed less food during both eating conditions compared to the normal-weight subjects,\" Professor Meena Shah said, \"it is possible that the overweight and obese subjects felt more self-conscious, and thus ate less during the study.\" Despite the differences in caloric consumption between the normal-weight and overweight and obese subjects, the study found some similarities.

I learned that my happiness depended on me and not my husband's actions. I learned that you have to choose to be happy. You can choose your emotions. True happiness comes from within; it can't be forced by outside forces. So how do you choose happiness? The same way you choose to smile or choose to wear a certain outfit.

You wouldn't buy a pair of shoes that you don't like or that don't fit well, right? So why do we keep choosing emotions and feelings that don't make us feel good? Choosing to be happy after you realize your anger has shown up (or even choosing to be calm) can be beneficial. We choose our feelings; no one can do that for us. If we let others get to us, influence our emotions - we are giving them power over us. When others cause us anger or pain, we are giving them our power. We need to keep our feelings in check and not react automatically to what is thrown at us. We need to think our actions out instead of just reacting to what someone says or does. Remember that we can always choose happiness. At first it will be difficult to just switch your thoughts and feelings from anger, self-doubt, or fear to joy and happiness.

We need to keep our feelings in check and not react automatically to what is thrown at us. We need to think our actions out instead of just reacting to what someone says or does. Remember that we can always choose happiness. At first it will be difficult to just switch your thoughts and feelings from anger, self-doubt, or fear to joy and happiness. But it is only a thought away. Don't dwell on what happens to you unnecessarily but realize what is causing you to feel that way. Realize that thoughts, feelings and emotions can change.

A fourth girl was held yesterday morning. The fire in a 19-storey building south of Paris was the third fatal blaze in the Paris area in nine days. The death toll rose to 16 after a man died late Sunday in a hospital, where seven others were being treated for serious injuries. Three teenagers taken in for questioning on Sunday admitted having started the fire for fun, police said. Two of the suspects were 18 years old, the other was 16. Further details were not available. Witnesses claimed to have seen a group of youths who lived in the building start the fire, said Patrick Seve, mayor of the town of L'HAY-LES-ROSES, near Orly airport, where the building was located. The first is believed to have broken out in the lobby   of the building before raging up a stairwell at least three floors. Some residents jumped from windows as the fire spread through the building's entrance. Authorities were investigating possible criminals in an August 26 fire that killed 14 African children and three adults in a Paris apartment building. Three days later, another fire killed seven in a building. k*s*5u Interior Minister Nicolas Sarkozy suggested on French television on Sunday night that copycats   were at work. \"Each time there is a new story, sometimes that gives ideas to people who then turn into criminals,\" Sarkozy said, promising severe punishment for anyone found guilty of arson  .

You don't have to visit the University to see the art. You just need a computer linked to a telephone. You can call the telephone number of a university computer and connect your own computer to it. All of the art is stored in the school computer. It is computer art, produced electronically by artists on their own computers. In only a few minutes, your computer can receive and copy all the pictures and drawings. Robert Shostak is direction of the new computer museum. He says he starts the museum because computer artists had no place to show their works. A computer artist can only record his pictures electronically and send the records to others to see on their computers. He can also put his pictures on paper. But to print good pictures on paper, the computer artist needs an expensive laser printer   . Robert Shostak says the electronic  museum is mostly for art or computer students at school and universities. Many of the pictures in the museum are made by students. Mr Shostake said the FIU museum will take computer art more fun for computer artists because more people can see it. He says artists enjoy their work much more if they have an audience.

But that gap has been narrowing in recent years and this year women have moved ahead, according to James Flynn, leader of the research. \"In the last 100 years the IQ scores of both men and women have risen but women's have risen faster,\" said Mr. Flynn. \"This is a result of modernity, which is making our brains adapt   and raising our IQ.\" One possible explanation is that women's lives have become more demanding as they multitask   between raising a family and doing a job. Another is that women have a slightly higher potential intelligence than men and are only now realizing it. Mr. Flynn, who will publish his findings in a book, said more data was needed to explain the trend. \"The full effect of modernity on women is only just starting,\" he added. He compared IQ result from countries in western Europe and from the United States, Canada, New Zealand, Argentina and Estonia. These showed that in westernized countries the gap in scores between men and women had become minimal  . The data for making comparison was limited and could be carried out for only a few countries. It included Australia, where male and female IQs were found to be almost the same. In New Zealand, Estonia and Argentina, women scored slightly more than men. Mr. Flynn said, \"As the world gets more complex, people are adapting.\" He added, \"I suspect that the same trends are happening in Britain, although the data is too limited to be true.\" What would be the best title for the text?", "subject": ""}

In the 1960s and 70s, Lennon was one of the most iconic men on the planet. Some 30 years ago on from his death, he is still respected by many people in the West. The Beatles, formed in 1960 in Liverpool, were one of the most commercial successful acts on the history of pop music, with, according to some estimates, global record sales over 1.1 billion. The band conveyed the progressive ideals in which many young people of the time believed. In the 1960s and 70s, widespread tension developed in both British and American society, regarding issues such as women's rights and the Vietnam War. Lennon in particular became known for his message of peace and for his opposition to the war in Vietnam. This led to an attempt by former US president Richard Nixon to drive him away from the US. Lennon's second-wife Yoko Ono was also politically active. Lennon was also hugely admired for his musical abilities. Along with fellow-Beatle Paul, Lennon and McCartney were the Beatle's song-writing team. After Lennon was shot by crazy fan Mark Chapman,one of his most iconic songs, Imagine, became a humanist anthem . Lennon's legacy survived his death and continued till this day.

When the heartbroken Jehan appeared eight days after his wife's death, his people were shocked to see that his coal-black hair had turned snow-white.

{"answer": 3, "choices": ["big meat eaters eat a 6oz steak per day", "big meat eaters have heart disease ten years earlier", "people eating more meat will suffer from a heart attack", "people eating more red meat have a higher risk of death"], "question": "Scientists have produced new evidence suggesting eating lots of red and processed meat damages health. They found big meat eaters had a raised risk of death from all causes over a 10-year period. In contrast, a higher intake of white meat was associated with a slightly reduced risk of death over the same period. The US study, based on more than 500,000 people, found those whose diet contained the highest proportion   of red or processed meat had a higher overall risk of death, and specifically a higher risk of cancer and heart disease than those who ate the least. People eating the most meat were eating about 160g of red or processed meat per day-- approximately a 6oz steak. Those who ate the least were only getting about 25g per day-- approximately a small piece of bacon. Just the opposite, those who ate the highest proportion of white meat had a lower risk of overall death, and a lower risk of fatal cancer or heart disease than those who ate the lowest proportion. Meat is a major source of saturated   fat, which has been associated with breast and colorectal cancer.

Visible light communication (VLC) uses rapid pluses of light to transmit information wirelessly. Now it may be ready to compete with conventional Wi-fi. In a recent TED talk, Harald Hasas from the University of Edinburge,UK demonstrated one VLC prototype ,\"Li-Fi\", transmitting a video from a store-bought LED lamp to a solar cell to a laptop. \"Li-Fi is essentially the same as Wi-Fi,except for a small difference- we use LED lights around us to transmit the data wirelessly as opposed to using radio,\" Haas says. Once established, VLC could solve some major communication problems. In 2009, the US Federal Communications Commission(FCC) warned of spectrum  crisis: because our mobile devices are so data- hungry we will soon run out of radio-frequency bandwidth.Li-Fi could free up bandwidth, especially as much of the infrastructure is already in place.\"There are around14 billion light bulbs worldwide, they just need to replaced with LED ones that transmit data\", says Haas. The idea of transmitting data through the visible light spectrum is not new.Alexander Graham Bell transmitted sound via a beam of sunlight in 1880 using a photo phone, a sort of solar-powered wireless telephone. In the past several decades, a number of researchers have looked at using visible light to transmit data. But what Haas seized on is the use of simple LED light bulbs for data transmission. LED bulbs are controlled by a driver, which can rapidly di the light or turn it on or off. Therefore, Haas figured, data could be encoded in subtle shifts of the light's brightness. Eventually, he creaded a working transmitter and receiver system with an IKEA lamp and a solar panel. Li-Fi stands to be much faster than Wi-Fi. According to Haas research, Li-Fi can achieve data density 1000 times greater than Wi-Fi,because Li-Fi signals are contained in a small area, as opposed to the more diffuse  ,radio signals.The system wouldn't mean having to keep your lights on all the time either, Haas says---bulbs could be dimmed to such a point that they appear off, but still transmit data. Now, Haas' team hopes that Li-Fi could make its way into homes in a few years. The system can easily network any device with an LED light--an electric kettle, an oven. Eventually, this could bring about the Internet of Things era much faster. Haas also  sees Li-Fi as a way to bring internet to remote location, using hilltop transmitters and rooftop solar panels. LED streetlights could even be used to form a network of outdoor Li-Fi, making it possible to stay connected when walking around the city. But some sound a cautious note about VLC's future. It becomes less powerful , for example,when light is blocked, wheather due to fog or other conditions.

People who drank mostly fruit juice instead of sodas did not have the same risk, the study of 60,000 people in Singapore found. Sugar may be to blame but people who drink sweetened sodas regularly often have other poor health habits, said Mark Pereira of the University of Minnesota, who led the study. \"The high levels of sugar in soft drinks may be increasing the level of insulin in the body, which we think contributes to pancreatic cancer cell growth,\" Pereira said in a statement. Writing in the journal Cancer Epidemiology, Biomarkers & Prevention, Pereira and colleagues said they followed 60,524 men and women in the Singapore Chinese Health Study for 14 years. Over that time, 140 of the volunteers developed pancreatic cancer. Those who drank two or more soft drinks a week had an 87 percent higher risk of being among those who got pancreatic cancer. Pereira said he believed the findings would apply elsewhere. \"Singapore is a wealthy country with excellent healthcare. Favorite pastimes  are eating and shopping, so the findings should apply to other western countries,\" he said. But Susan Mayne of the Yale Cancer Center at Yale University in Connecticut was cautious. \"Although this study found a risk, the finding was based on a  ly small number of cases and it remains unclear whether it is a causal connection or not,\" said Mayne, who serves on the board of the journal, which is published by the American Association for Cancer Research. Pancreatic cancer is one of the deadliest forms of cancer, with 230,000 cases globally. In the United States, 37,680 people are diagnosed with pancreatic cancer in a year and 34,290 die of it.

Scientists from Britain and Poland took cells from his nose, transplanted   them into his back and re-grew his spinal cord  . Now he can walk and even drive a car. The doctors were delighted but said it was the first step in a long journey. The breakthrough came after 40 years of research by Professor Geoff Raisman, who found that cells had the possibility to repair damage to nasal   nerves, the only part of the nervous system that constantly re-grows. \"The idea was to take something from an area where the nervous system can repair itself and put it into an area that doesn't repair itself,\" Professor Raisman said. Polish doctors injected   the nasal cells into Mr Fidyka's spinal cord above the injury and used some nerves from his ankle to form a bridge across the damaged tissue.

The study also found that 81 per cent completed their work fastest when music was played. And it matters what type of music you listen to.

Listening to Jessie J or Justin Bieber could also improve your speed, with 58 per cent of participants completing data entry tasks faster while listening to pop songs. During proofreading, dance music, such as David Guetta, had the biggest positive impact with participants increasing their speed by 20 per cent compared to tests undertaken with no music at all. Dance music also had a positive effect on spellchecking with a 75 per cent pass rate compared to 68 per cent when no music was played at all.

Dad did some research and had no difficulty in finding us cheap tickets online. On the day of our flight, we had to wake up very early. When we checked our bags in, we found that one bag weighed too much, so we had to pay a fine. After that, Dad insisted that we go and have some breakfast at the airport restaurant. We had a lot of fun watching many different people there. Then we realized it was getting late, so we rushed to the gate. It took one hour for everyone to get on the plane, but finally the door was shut and we were on our way! I think my favorite experience during our trip was our visit to Mount Rainier, a volcano near Seattle. It was nothing like I had expected. Before we left, my aunt lent us hats to protect us from getting sunburned, so I supposed that it would be very hot. Imagine my surprise when we drove up the mountain and I discovered the top was covered in snow and ice! My uncle led us to a small path beyond the main trails to increase our chances of seeing wildlife. We walked over a small hill, and suddenly before us there appeared a field of snow.

The industry leaders from the business communities of the five countries agreed that the BRICS countries will actively support industrialization on the African continent in order to contribute significantly to its development and to expand trade links between Africa and  BRICS.The global economic situation,though improving,continues to remain uncertain with the Euro-crisis a major concern.The task ahead is to build on these developments and BRICS countries remain committed to the cause of promoting sustainable growth.Greater economic cooperation among BRICS countries can be significantly important,which will prove beneficial for global economic growth. According to Dr.Rob Davies,South African Minister of Trade and Industry,the African continent is recognized as the second fastest growing continent after Asia.There are four drivers of the economic growth in African continent.These are the boom in mineral products in the African continent,the development of the service industries,the benefit of not having the financial crisis,and infrastructure development.Davies also adds that other BRICS countries have advantage of large populations providing big home markets for their products.The South African population is small compared to other BRICS countries,but if you add up numbers on continent then you have a critical mass that can support the new industrial wave in Africa:That is why the South African needs to create large trading blocks across large parts of African continent.

During that time I have seen her work tirelessly on scores of community projects and committees. As far as I know, she has never received any kind of recognition from the community for her work. I believe she should be given some sort of special recognition. Just last year alone, she worked on at least six different community projects including the Park Renewal Project and the Heritage Homes FundRaising Banquet. In addition, she is a weekly driver for the MealsonWheels program and she visits patients in the care unit on a regular basis. Whenever a project or committee needs her, she will put herself into the work wholeheartedly. I'm sure that if you check with a few of your staff members who have been there over the years, they will confirm Elizabeth's community service record and probably be able to add many examples to the few I have given here. By the way, Elizabeth has no idea that I am writing this. She is a humble   person, and if she were aware of it, she would not allow me to send it.

Research in the sixties found the opposite. So which is it? Researchers presented their newest studies last month at a meeting of the American Association for the Advancement of Science.

She says bilingual people are often better at controlling their attention--a function called the executive control system.

Her work shows that bilingual people continually practice this function. They have to, because both languages are active in their brain at the same time. They need to limit one to be able to speak in the other. This mental exercise might help in other ways, too.

Modiano was born in a suburb of Paris right after World War IIended in Europe in July 1945.His  father was a JewishItalian businessman who met his Belgian actress mother during the Nazi occupation of Paris. As The New Yorker magazine put it, Europeans born in 1945 share a condition--They escaped the war, but \"not the taint  of the war\". Modiano's life has been influenced by Nazi Germany's occupation during the war, and his family's connections to it.According to New Yorkbased newspaper Forward, his father survived the war dishonorably.When Paris' Jews were brought together to be sent to concentration camps, the businessman did not join them but spent the time making money from deals with Nazis on the black market. \"The novelist has a duty to record the lives of the people who have disappeared, the people who were made to disappear,\" French writer Clemence Boulouque, also an expert in Jewish studies, told The New Yorker magazine. In his more than three dozen novels, Modiano has returned again and again to the same themes:Jewishness, the Nazi occupation, and loss of identity.His characters collect pieces of old evidence, handwriting, photographs, police files, and newspaper cuttings. His most admired novel,Missing Person, is a good example.It's the story about a detective who has lost his memory.He tries to find out who he really is by following his own steps through history. Although Modiano's win is a surprise outside France, people are celebrating in his home country.Modiano is the 15th French literature winner.After Le Clezio's 2008 win, it seemed unlikely that there would be another so soon.

Modern holistic  medicine is an approach that treats the whole patient, not just the disease. It is a way to maintain good health rather than cure illness. The most important influences on today's holistic medicine are ancient Chinese medicine and Indian Ayurvedic medicine, both of which promoted the whole body health. Holistic medicine usually combines diet, physical exercise and meditation, together with other alternative techniques such as massage  and acupuncture . Herbal treatment ,a practice of treating illness by using plants, is influenced by the writings of Culpeper as well as Chinese and Ayurvedic medicine. Homeopathy is one of the forms of holistic medicine which is widely practiced in Europe and the USA. Homeopathy began in Germany in the early 1800s, when Samuel Hahnemann described how very tiny doses of a drug had an effect on his patients.

The next morning, Reed could not move. \"Doctors said it was likely that I would never walk again.\" Reed stared out of his hospital window, wondering what the future would be like. It was the saddest moment of his life. \"The experts are telling me my body doesn't work! What am I supposed to do?\" he thought. To distract   himself, he picked up a book: Robert Heinlein's Starship Troopers. The science-fiction describes a set of man-made muscles that would allow people to carry 2,000 pounds. He thought that if he could build something like that, it might be able to lift him out of his wheelchair. So he began his project and finally succeeded in building a set of robot legs. Several years later, he made an amazing recovery and was able to get up and walk away from his wheelchair. He even jumped out of an airplane again to celebrate. Reed wanted to do something for others with the second chance that life had given him. He has now perfected the robot legs that can get the injured, the elderly and the paralyzed   out of their wheelchairs. Now he has started his own company to make the legs. \"I've seen them compete in marathons and go swimming and mountain climbing,\" he said. \"So never give up!\" We can learn from the passage that Monty's goal is to   _  .", "subject": ""}

After that, I decided to  _ as many speaking opportunities as possible, to try to become more comfortable with the idea of talking before groups.I knew it wouldn't be easy.I know the material --I've written two books about taxes ?but I am a bit of a perfectionist and rely heavily on notes, which can create a lot of anxiety. I talked to my father about how the magic trick had bombed, and he suggested that I have him criticize me.I gave the same speech to him, without the magic trick.He said that I seemed more nervous when I relied on my notes and that I should speak more from my heart.I've done that ever since, and it has helped.

The liquid glass can protect any type of surface from damages caused by water, UV radiation, dirt, heat, and bacterial infections. Besides, it is flexible and breathable, which means that the liquid glass can be applied on plants and seeds as well. Researchers found that the spray greatly increases the resistance of plants to bacteria-caused diseases. The trials also showed that the sprayed seeds grew faster.  Depending on the type of surface that is to be covered, researchers can add water or ethanol to the spray. Scientists say that  _ . The spray produces a coating that is just 100nm thick. Trials by food processing plants in Germany have concluded that foods covered with the glass can store longer than those stored in normal condition. According to Neil McClelland, UK project manager with Nanopool, due to its capabilities, the spray-on liquid glass can become one of the most useful inventions around the world, ending up being used by a lot of industries that will cover their products.

{"answer": 1, "choices": ["showing they are happy", "a way of warning", "showing they are angry", "a way of greeting"], "question": "Have you ever wondered why birds sing? Maybe you thought that they were just happy. After all, you probably sing or whistle when you are happy.    Some scientists believe that birds do sing some of the time just because they are happy. However, they sing most of the time for a very different reason. Their singing is actually a warning to other birds to stay out of their territory.    Do you know what a 'territory' is? A territory is an area that an animal, usually the male, claims   as its own. Only he and his family are welcome there. No other families of the same species  are welcome. Your yard and house are your territory where only your family and friends are welcome. If a stranger enter your territory and threaten you, you may shout. Probably this is enough to frighten him away.    If so, you have actually scared the stranger away without having to fight him. A bird does the same thing. But he expects an outsider almost any time, especially at nesting season. So he is screaming all the time, whether he can see an outsider or not.

He rushed into the classical music scene at the age of 12 after Itzhak Perlman, the famed violinist, heard him play. But nothing in his family history explains where Haimovitz got his extraordinary talent. And that's typical, Ellen Winner, a professor says. \"People are fascinated by these children because they don't understand where their talent came from. You will see parents who say, 'I wasn't like this, and my husband wasn't like this.' It seems to sometimes just come out of the blue,\" Winner says. It's not clear whether a prodigy's  brain is any different from the brains of other children, in part because there have been no study comparing the brains of prodigies to those of average people. \"But I believe that anything that shows up so early, without training, has got to be either a genetic or some other biological basis,\" Winner says. \"If a child suddenly at the age of 3 goes to the piano and picks out a tune and does it beautifully, that has to be because that child has a different brain.\" Children who are extremely gifted tend to be socially different, too, Winner says. \"They feel like they can't find other kids like themselves, so they feel strange, maybe even like a freak, and feel like they don't have anybody to connect with. On the other hand, they also long to connect with other kids, and they can't find other kids like themselves.\" As Haimovitz got older, he became frustrated. He wanted to play other kinds of music but felt constricted by the image and the expectations of the boy prodigy who played classical music and filled concert halls. \"When you start that early, you suddenly start to grow up in public, and I wanted to experiment,\" Haimovitz says. So he took his cello into punk rock clubs and coffee houses. He played Bach, Haydn and Hendrix. \"My teacher was Leonard Rose, and we never played any 20th-century music. He didn't like it. But once I was exposed to James Marshall \"Jimi\" Hendrix, Miles Dewey Davis El and others, I couldn't really turn back. I wanted to know more,\" he says.

Newcomers were welcomed with chocolate and bread. It had been easy to find friends there. Our new community was different. It seemed that family roots grew deep. Deep as the Mississippi river that flowed past the tiny river town. We'd moved to decrease my husband's commute to work. Only thirty miles. After living there for six months, I was ready to move back home. I was lonely for a friend. My three boys were lonely. My husband, Lonny, fared okay, but he spent his days at work. Lonny noticed my sinking disposition.  \"Shawnelle, you look unapproachable,\" he said. He and I were sitting in lawn chairs. Samuel, our three-year-old son sat in his own little chair. \"What do you mean?\" \"Body language. You placed our chairs fifteen yards away from everyone else.\" \"It doesn't matter. I'm not going to have friends here. \" Just then Samuel looked up. \"Mom's right, Dad. And we just want to go home. \" That's when I knew that I needed an adjustment. I didn't want my boys to learn that the way to work through a tough time was to use a wounded and bitter attitude. Over the next few months I smiled when I didn't feel like it.

We all cope with pressure in various ways. Yet you have no fear because there are ways to keep a healthy mind and healthy body. Whether you are planning your week or planning your day of study, a revision timetable will keep you focused and it will make it a lot less difficult to achieve those glorious high marks. A timetable will direct your efforts in the right direction. Besides, you also enjoy the satisfaction you get as a result of completing the most impossible timetable. Strict deadlines and time management techniques increase your confidence and make you work more efficiently  . Unfortunately, the work does not stop after perfecting the revision timetable. It is much easier to get motivated but more difficult to insist. It is fundamental that you choose to study in a quiet place where any distractions are out of sight. However, one mistake we all make is where we sit down, bury ourselves in books and remain in the same position until the sun goes down. You may think you have had a highly productive day of revision but in fact the quality of your work would have been better if you had allowed yourself short and often breaks. There is of course a limit to how long you can concentrate for. Therefore, it is important that you get some fresh air throughout the day. These breaks help to absorb what you have learnt and help avoid information overload. And lastly, avoid separating yourself from everybody else. Remember we have all felt under pressure at one point. Ask questions if you do not understand something. Learn to talk about it with friends or family when you are feeling stressed. You will have the ability to put everything back into a bright future.

Today dozens of firms in the area supply many of the world's approximately 13,000 RO plants in places from the Persian Gulf and Israel to Australia and China.

This has led to a type of shopping called \"showrooming\". Showrooming is something I've done. I will go to a shop to see, touch and try out products but then go home and buy them online at a knock-down price. I'm not alone in doing this. Research by a company called Foolproof, found 24% of people showroomed while Christmas shopping in 2013. Amy Cashman, head of Technology at TNS UK, says the reasons for this new shopping habit are that \"people are lacking time, lacking money and they want security about the products they are buying\". She explains that consumers are not only shopping online at home but they are using the Internet in store or on their smartphones to shop around. But does this mean technology will kill shops? Certainly shops will change. They will have to offer more competitive prices or encourage people to buy more by giving in-store discounts or free gifts. We mustn't forget that buying in a shop means you can get expert advice from the sales assistant and you can get good aftercare.

His arts were poetry, painting, and drama, and in all of them he was an experimenter. The poetry -- for which he is best remembered -- was marked by strange combinations of words and expressions and produced in very strange print. The unusual techniques that Cummings used served to present his ideas more forcefully and effectively than would have been the case with more ordinary styles.               Cummings was born in Cambridge, Massachusetts, on Oct. 14, 1894. He graduated from Harvard College in 1915 and received a master's degree in 1916. During World War I he served as an ambulance driver in France. He spent six months in prison because of his friendship with another American who had supposedly criticized the countries that fought against Germany in the First World War. This experience increased his distrust of all officialdom  , a distrust that showed itself in many of his later poems as well as in his first book, \"The Enormous Room\", published in 1922.               Between the two world wars Cummings divided his time between Paris and New York City. His first book of poetry was \"Tulips and Chimneys\" (1923). The poems in the book were collected in \"Complete Poems\" (1968). The strangeness of his style was criticized by some, but others found it meaningful.

She forces me to sing some songs at concerts myself, so I started going to a bar to practice them. This was my first, small breakthrough. One day she came round to my flat and informed me that she could no longer work with me, and also that the bar owner at the open mic venue  had replaced us at short notice because some New York jazz star happened to be in town, and was available that evening to perform. The first bit of news made me sad and disappointed, but the second made me angry. However, that same evening, with as much determination as I could muster  , I resolved to play three new songs at the bar, just as I had planned before. I was quite nervous, but I dragged myself down to the bar and sang those songs! I never felt so liberated . That night I couldn't get to sleep. I was simply astonished, hardly believing that I was a person who acted so courageously, and that I'd been able to sing my songs myself. Since then I've begun to encourage others to adopt a similar approach when they aren't able to see their own potential.

Captioning ,such as \"closed captioning\" for hearing disabled viewers provides another way for parents to exploit the educational possibilities of television.One study showed that children who watched captioned TV got great improvement in their vocabulary and oral reading ability. In addition, parents can make any show a learning class by watching television together with children. By actively joining children in the programs that they are watching, parents can help with the development of such skills as predicting and summarizing. In order to develop predicting skills, parents and children could first refer to a program's description in a viewing guide.After reading the program description and guessing what might happen in the program, parents and children could watch together to see which predictions were correct. And to practice summarizing, after watching a program, parents can turn off the TV and ask what the story was about.

{"answer": 1, "choices": ["He owned the island.", "He was a prisoner there.", "His family lived there.", "He liked the island."], "question": "Napoleon Bonaparte died on May 5, 1821, on the island of St. Helena off the coast of Africa. He was 51 years old at the time. When doctors examined Napoleon's body, they said that the former emperor of France had died from cancer of the stomach. That was the cause of death recorded in the official report. However, other doctors disagreed. One doctor who was present during the examination of the body said that Napoleon died of hepatitis. Other historians and medical experts have suggested that Napoleon died of syphilis, tuberculosis, or perhaps malaria. Now, after careful research, a British chemist thinks that Napoleon might have been poisoned -- not by a person, but by his wallpaper. Napoleon was sent to the island of St. Helena in 1815 after he lost the battle of Waterloo. He was a prisoner on the island. Although he had servants to attend to him, he had to live in one small building. St. Helena is a very wet island, so the walls of the building were always covered with mold. Napoleon became ill from spending too much time inside his house. Almost constantly he had a fever, chills, and felt sick to his stomach. He often felt pain in his shoulders and in his side. His skin turned yellow. He got frequent headaches, and he would become dizzy and vomit . None of the medicine that the doctors gave Napoleon seemed to help. They were not sure what was the matter. Finally, Napoleon was too weak to leave the house. One night, while he was sleeping, he went into a coma and died. Many doctors who later reviewed the reports of Napoleon's illness found that the symptoms  did not show a man who suffered from stomach cancer. It seemed obvious that Napoleon had died from some other cause. In 1961, a Swedish doctor examined some of Napoleon's hair and found a high level of arsenic, a chemical poison. Was Napoleon murdered? It is doubtful. Arsenic was used in many types of medicine during Napoleon's time, so he might have taken the arsenic as a cure for his illness. Then, in 1982, Dr. David Jones from England began to look into the mystery and suggested that Napoleon might have breathed in arsenic which was in the air of his house. In the 1700s and 1800s, arsenic was used to make a kind of green paint used on cloth and wallpaper. If the paint was used on a wet wall, the arsenic would go into the air. A person in the room might breathe that air. After studying the wallpaper in the room where Napoleon died, Dr. Jones found high levels of arsenic in the green paint on the walls.

Langkawi has come a long way since then; there are 4, 5, and even 6-star hotels, as well as spas, golfing, horseback riding and even a cable car taking visitors to the highest point on the island. At the Langkawi International Airport I met my shipmates and we were driven to Pantai Tengah with a quick pit stop for sunblock and duty-free goodies. Many other shopping opportunities abound since Langkawi was designated as a duty-free zone in 1987 to entice tourists to the island. A luxurious yacht tender picked us up. Phillipe, the first mate, maneuvered the tender between sailboats and as we went around a small island there she was, S/V Blue Gold. This majestic 10-passenger sailboat--all 165 feet of her--had been built in Italy and recently underwent a full retrofit. Once aboard, the crew welcomed us with refreshments and big smiles. Before we got too comfortable and settled into the plush comforts of the boat, Alain, the captain, took us on a tour of Blue Gold's impressive accommodations. The master suite had a king-size bed, with a lounge area and \"his & hers\" wardrobes. The VIP cabin had a queen-size bed, also with a lounge area. Both had ensuite bathrooms. The first evening aboard was the perfect start to our voyage--a small cocktail party followed by a light meal of seared tuna salad. It was exactly what our jet-lagged bodies craved, and we all slept very well aboard what would become our new home for the next 7 days. In the morning after breakfast, we sailed to Pulau Ta Ngah (also spelled \"Pulau Tengah\"; pulau means island in Malay). In the 1970s the site had been a Vietnamese refugee transit camp. Not long after the end of the war, the camp was shut down and the island was gazetted as a marine park by the Malaysian government. Officially \"uninhabited,\" it does boast a golf course, but we were unable to determine if it was still in operation. The most intriguing event on the island occurs in July when the giant leatherback turtles lay their eggs on a beach on Ta Ngah. The article is probably part of   _  .", "subject": ""}
{"answer": 2, "choices": ["International Affairs", "Entertainment", "Agriculture", "Culture"], "question": "American farmers are raising five percent more goats for meat these days. Goat meat is high in protein and lower in unhealthy fat than many other meats.Even so,the industry is small compared to chicken,beef and pork. But immigration has brought more of a taste for goat to America from all over the world. Experts from the University of Illinois offer some questions for people to consider if they are thinking about raising goats. First of all,do you understand that there always has to be someone to care for the goats? *How much land do you have available? And how good is it? Poor ground may support two to four goats on half a hectare.Better grassland can support six to eight. If goats and cattle share the land,two goats can be added for each cow. The goats will eat weeds and other plants that cattle do not like. *Do you have buildings for the number of female goats you plan to keep during winter? An open,cold,dry barn is better than a closed,warm barn where the air is wet. *Do you have the equipment to clean barns  and to harvest hay  to feed your goats?

They not only hide the real face of the mask wearer but they often evoke powerful emotions in the audience--danger, fear, sadness, joy. You might think, because so many things vary cross-culturally, that the ways in which emotions are displayed and recognized in the face vary too. Apparently they do not. Recent research on masks from different cultures supports the conclusion that masks, like faces, tend to represent certain emotions in the same ways. We now have some evidence that the symbolism used in masks is often universal. The research on masks builds on work done by anthropologists, who used photographs of individuals experiencing various emotions. These photographs were shown to members of different cultural groups who were asked to identify the emotions displayed in the photographs. Emotions were identified correctly by most viewers, whatever the viewer's native culture. Coding schemes were developed to enable researchers to compare the detailed facial positions of individual portions of die face (eyebrows, mouth, etc.) for different emotions. What exactly do we do when we scowl? We contract the eyebrows and lower the corners of the mouth; in geometric terms, we make angles and diagonals   on our faces. When we smile, we raise the corners of the mouth; we make it curved. Psychologist Joel Arnoff and his colleagues compared two types of wooden face masks from many different societies--masks described as threatening versus masks associated with nonthreatening functions. As suspected, the two sets of masks had significant differences in certain facial elements. The threatening masks had eyebrows and eyes facing inward and downward and a downward-facing mouth. In more abstract or geometrical terms, threatening features generally tend to be angular or diagonal and nonthreatening features tend to be curved or rounded, a face with a pointed beard is threatening; _ is not.

{"answer": 1, "choices": ["having the ability to perceive danger", "having a far greater memory capacity", "having the ability to recognize faces and places on sight", "having the ability to draw on past experiences"], "question": "We take it for granted that with memory we can remember most of things which happened in our life. But it is difficult to imagine what life would be like without memory. The meanings of thousands of everyday perceptions , the basis for the decisions we make, and the roots of our habits and skills are to be found in our past experiences, which are brought into the present by memory. Memory can be defined as the ability to keep information available for later use. It not only includes \"remembering\" things like arithmetic  or historical facts, but also involves any change in the way an animal typically behaves. Memory is involved when a rat gives up eating grain because he has sniffed something suspicious in the grain pile. Memory exists not only in humans and animals but also in some physical objects and machines. Computers, for example, contain devices for storing data for later use. It is interesting to compare the memory storage capacity  of a computer with that of a human being. The instant access memory of a large computer may hold up to 100,000 \"words\"--strings of alphabetic or numerical characters--ready for instant use. An average U.S. teenager probably recognizes the meaning of about 1000,000 words of English. However, this is but a part of the total amount of information that the teenager has stored. Consider, for example, the number of faces and places that the teenager can recognize on sight. The use of words is the basis of the advanced problem solving intelligence of human beings. A large part of a person's memory is in terms of words and combinations of words. But while language greatly expands the number and the kind of things a person can remember, it also requires a huge memory capacity.

But this time there was a young woman behind the piano, playing what I could only describe as absolutely beautiful classical music. She had not been there ten minutes earlier when I passed. I sat down at an empty table for four very near the piano, and began to be warmed by her music and a bit by the wine! She played so effortlessly and with such beauty in every note. Her music immediately brought a huge smile to my face! Soon, on a break, I thanked her and she told me that after a long day traveling, and now also facing long weather delays, she \"just needed to _ .\" Wow! Her version of blowing off steam was a gift to get. As I sat alone drinking my wine, absorbed in this young woman's celebration of her musical passion, two women approached my table and asked if they could join me. I invited them to sit and we immediately began sharing our love of music and celebrating the happiness the piano music was bringing us at that moment. The two women and I began to talk about our travels, life journeys, and passions. Hearing that unbelievable piano music, and then meeting such interesting women, who generously shared with me their wisdom, perspectives, and feelings of love for each other, was truly joyous. Faced with an 11-hour travel day -- to get what normally takes 45 minutes -- could have been physically and emotionally exhausting. Rather, by accident of walking by a wine bar at the right moment, and having a couple of seats open at my table, my life was filled with joy. I will cherish those moments for some time to come. This experience highlights   the critical need in our lives to stop and listen to the music, to invite others to sit at your life table, to open yourself up to a stranger or two, sharing some of your deepest perspectives and experiences.

Japan controls the uninhabited but resource-rich East China Sea islands, which are also claimed by Taiwan. The Japanese Coast Guard said the first two Chinese boats entered Japan's territorial waters at 06:18 local time (21:18 GMT Thursday), followed by another fleet of four other ships just after 07:00. The first two ships then left the area. A third ship left later on Friday morning, one report said. No force was used, Japanese officials added. \"Our patrol vessels are currently telling them to leave our country's territorial waters,\" the coastguard said in a statement. The Chinese foreign ministry confirmed that its ships were there. \"These law enforcement and patrol activities are aimed to demonstrate China's jurisdiction over the Diaoyu Islands and its affiliated islets and ensure the country's maritime interests,\" a statement said.

US Defense Secretary Leon Panetta is due to visit both Japan and China from this weekend as part of a tour of the region that also includes New Zealand.  The dispute has seriously marred diplomatic relations between China and Japan and threatens to damage the strong trading relationship, says the BBC's John Sudworth in Beijing.

Then it was noted that the sun cast a changing shadow as it moved across the sky. Time could be told more accurately by setting up a stick and marking the positions of the sun's shadow. It was the ancient Greeks who divided each position of this \"sundial \" into hours. But the sun doesn't always shine. So,for the past 6,000 years,many other ways of keeping time have been tried. Slowburning candles were divided into hours,and the hourglass was invented. When all the sand in the top of an hourglass has shifted to the bottom,an hour has passed.

You may treat life with the philosophy   of the vegetable, in which case your life will include being born, eating, drinking, sleeping, marrying, growing old and dying. The second basic attitude is to look at life as if it were a business. A great many so-called successful men and women believe that life is a business. If you believe so, your first question of life, naturally, is \" What do I get out of it? \" \" How much is this worth to me?\" In a word, based on this attitude, happiness becomes a matter of successful competition.

Now some doctors have noticed that kids who bring their hand-held game players to the hospital seem less worried about being there. These patients also seem to experience less pain when they are concentrating on a superhero adventure or a car race. At the Johns Hopkins Children's Center in Maryland, young patients are finding hospital visits easier to deal with, thanks to a test program called the Hospital-based On-line Pediatric Environment (HOPE). Patients in HOPE have a life-threatening condition where their kidneys no longer filter wastes from their blood. To get their blood cleaned, these kids must be hooked up to dialysis  machines at the hospital three times a week, for at least three hours each time. HOPE allows kids to play online sports, racing, and adventure games with each other. Eventually they will be able to connect with kids in other hospitals who are suffering from the same problem. \"We want to use the power of the Internet to bring together kids who feel that they are separated by their illness, and let them know that they are not alone,\" said Arun Mathews, the doctor who heads the program. He loves video games himself and got the idea to connect kids all over the country. Many researchers elsewhere are testing video game programs that might help young patients. For example, nine-year-old Ben Duskin of San Francisco, who was struggling with cancer helped to design a video game where players get rid of cancer cells.

What hit the Pentagon? A Boeing 757 loaded with passengers and fuel right? Who was on Flight 757? According to the Flight Information there were No Arabs on it.

{"answer": 1, "choices": ["His love for his family.", "His childhood sufferings.", "His desire for formal education.", "His reason to choose literary career."], "question": "Charles Dickens was one of the most beloved storytellers in the English language. His novels made him famous in his own time, and continue as classics in ours.      Dickens began his literary career with almost no formal education. He was born in Landport, on Feb. 7, 1812, the second of eight children. When he was 12, his father was sent to debtor's prison. Dickens was forced to quit school and work in a London blacking factory. He would rework that terrible experience into his fiction for the rest of his life.      \"He was a social reformer,\" says actor Simon Callow, author of a new biography called Charles Dickens and the Great Theatre of the World.  \"He knew what poverty was. He knew what it was to be rejected, to be cast aside, to  live in squalor  .\"      And so Dickens wrote with great sympathy for the suffering of innocent and vulnerable   children - characters like David Copperfield, Little Dorrit and the orphan, Oliver Twist:       With his slice of bread in his hand, and his little brown parish cap on his head, Oliver was now led away from the wretched home, where one kind word or look never lighted the gloom of his infant   days.       Yet he burst into an agony of childish grief as the cottage gate closed after him.  Wretched as were the little companions in,misery he was now leaving behind him, they were the only friends he had ever had.       His first book Sketches by Boz came out in 1836. With the appearance of Oliver Twist in London periodicals in 1837, the 25-year-old Dickens became the most popular writer in England. But his first love was theater, and he considered becoming an actor.      \"When he was actually writing, he became his characters,\" says Peter Ackroyd, author of Dickens: Public Life and Private Passion. \"He would get up from his desk, go over to the mirror and mouth the words - do the expressions, grimaces  , whatever, and then laugh, chuckle to himself, then go back to his desk and write it down.\"      Dickens created 989 named characters, which increased his popularity. Every one of his major works has been adapted for either stage or screen. A Christmas Carol inspired more than a dozen films, from Alistair Sims' Scrooge in 1951 to Jim Carrey's voicing of the same character in Disney's 2009, 3-D animated film.

Boyle, who eamed a doctorate in Victorian literature.      \"He achieved what any great artist achieves - a body of work that has entertained and delighted and instructed people down through the ages. That's what we all hope for,\" says Boyle.       But Dickens' greatest fiction was his own character, says Callow, the biographer: \"People think of him as a cheerful man ... but he was increasingly suffering from depression and a sense of hopelessness. And that's worth knowing. I think it's always good to know that great creative individuals have their struggle, their drama.\" What did Dickens intend to do by telling his stories?", "subject": ""}

Mr. Milton stood for quite a long time, then he raised his arms, took one massive bounce and launched himself into a perfect dive. It was beautiful. He fell with perfect style for what seemed minutes. The crowd fell silent. The only sound to be heard was the faint whistle of his body tearing through the air toward the water far, far below. But about three quarters of the way down he seemed to have second thoughts and began suddenly to panic, waving his arms and legs like someone having a bad dream. When he was perhaps thirty feet above the water, he gave up on waving and spread his arms and legs wide, apparently hoping that it would somehow slow his fall. It didn't. He hit the water at over six hundred miles an hour. The impact was so loud that it made birds fly out of their trees three miles away. I don't think he entered the water at all. He just bounced off it, about fifteen feet back into the air. After that, he lay still on the surface, spinning like an autumn leaf. He was brought to shore by two passing fishermen in a rowboat and placed on an old blanket where he spent the rest of the afternoon. Occasionally he accepted small sips of water, but otherwise was too shocked to speak. From head to toe, he was covered with deep red bruises. ... It was the best day of my life.

{"answer": 0, "choices": ["The Angles.", "The Saxons.", "The Jutes.", "The Normans."], "question": "The English language is the result of the invasion  of the island of Britain over many hundreds of years.The first invasions were by a people called Angles about 1, 500 years ago. The Angles were a German tribe who crossed the English Channel . Later two more groups crossed to Britain. They were the Saxons and the Jutes. Through many years, the Saxons, Angles and the Jutes mixed their different languages. The result is what is called Anglo-Saxon or old English. The next great invasion of Britain was done by Vikings about 1, 100 years ago. Many English words used today come from these ancient Vikings. The next invasion of Britain took place more than 900 years ago, in 1066. History experts call this invasion the Norman Conquest. The Normans were a French-speaking people from Normandy in the north of France. These new rulers  spoke only French for several hundred years. It was the most important language in the world at that time. It was the language of educated people. But the common people of Britain still spoke old English. Old English took many words from the Norman French. Some of these include \"damage\", \"prison\", and \"marriage\". The French language used by the Norman rulers greatly changed the way English was spoken 800 years ago. English became what language experts call Middle English. Middle English sounds like Modern English. But it is difficult to understand now. The history of the English language continues as Middle English becomes Modern English, which is spoken today.

At the opening of his latest exhibition, Colorful World in the Eyes of Sean Chen, at the National Museum of China recently, the artist told his story. Chen left China for Australia in 1986 to seek artistic freedom, and like many new immigrants then, he had little money in his pocket. To make ends meet, he drew portraits of people in the street. Every day, he saw people buy ice cream from a shop. Chen couldn't help wondering: \"It must taste great, that's why so many people buy it.\" But he didn't buy one for himself because he had to save money to support his studies. After four months of painting there and watching people eat ice cream, Chen didn't resist the temptation --- he bought an ice cream. \"The first bite took me to heaven,\" Chen recalls while laughing. \"You know, as a poor young man in a new country, an ice cream was too expensive then.\" Since then, he kept the taste of the ice cream in his heart and included the happy feelings in his paintings, which turn out to be colorful and sweet.

When my brother and I were growing up, we mowed  yards during the summer to earn pocket change. Dad was our salesman. He told our neighbors about our service and offered a price they could not refuse. My brother and I got $ 10 per yard. I later found out that our friends were charging $ 20 or more for the same amount of work. Every time we headed out to mow lawns , Dad was there to watch. I used to wonder why he came with us. He stood supervising  our work in the heat when he could have been inside relaxing with air conditioning and an icy drink. One day we were cutting our next-door neighbor's yard, he always waited until the grass was knee-high to call us over. To make matters worse, we had an old lawn mower. This particular afternoon, I was finishing up and was tired and sweaty. I was just about to cut off the lawn mower when I saw Dad pointing to one piece of grass. He yelled, \"You missed a piece.\" I frowned, hoping he would let it slide and let me go home. He kept pointing. So, tired and disappointed, I went back to cut that piece of grass.

{"answer": 1, "choices": ["Father's Story", "Honesty", "Family Matters", "Supervising"], "question": "Dad was always full of advice, but one of the biggest lessons he taught me one summer was about having a strong work ethic . When my brother and I were growing up, we mowed  yards during the summer to earn pocket change. Dad was our salesman. He told our neighbors about our service and offered a price they could not refuse. My brother and I got $ 10 per yard. I later found out that our friends were charging $ 20 or more for the same amount of work. Every time we headed out to mow lawns , Dad was there to watch. I used to wonder why he came with us. He stood supervising  our work in the heat when he could have been inside relaxing with air conditioning and an icy drink. One day we were cutting our next-door neighbor's yard, he always waited until the grass was knee-high to call us over. To make matters worse, we had an old lawn mower. This particular afternoon, I was finishing up and was tired and sweaty. I was just about to cut off the lawn mower when I saw Dad pointing to one piece of grass. He yelled, \"You missed a piece.\" I frowned, hoping he would let it slide and let me go home. He kept pointing. So, tired and disappointed, I went back to cut that piece of grass. I said to myself, \"That one piece isn't hurting anyone. Why won't he just let it go?\" But when I reached adulthood, I understood his message ---When you're running a business, the work you do says a great deal about you.

The Romans designed a special day to show admiration and respect to the moon. They called it \"Moonday\", or \"Monday\", as we know it today. Later, the great mind of Leonardo da Vinci studied the moon and designed a machine to carry a human to the moon. Leonardo said that one day a great machine bird would take a person to the moon and bring great honour to the home where it was born. Four and a half centuries later, Leonardo's idea was realized. Apollo II took three Americans--Collins, Aldrin, and Armstrong--to the moon. The mission   did fill the whole world with great surprise, as Leonardo had said it would. A lot of essays, articles, and books were written about man's first moon mission. But perhaps the most interesting story was one written before the event----over 100 years before.  In 1865, French author Jules Verne wrote a story about the first journey to the moon. His story was very similar to the 1969 Apollo II mission.  Verne's spacecraft also contained three men--two Americans and a Frenchman. The spacecraft was described as being almost the same size as Apollo II. The launch site in Verne's story was also in prefix = st1 /Florida. The spacecraft in Verne's story was named the \"Columbiad\". The Apollo II command ship was called \"Columbia\". His account of sending the spacecraft into the space could easily have been written about how Apollo II was sent into the space. Verne's story was the same as the actual event in several other respects. The speed of Verne's spacecraft was 36,000 feet per second; Apollo's was 35,533 feet per second.

In a study about 31 per cent of adults said they once told their children the curly hair tale, and 36 per cent said they'd been told the same thing by their mother or father. Among the over-50s, almost half said they'd been promised curly hair if they ate their crusts. A quarter of the 2,000 adults questioned in the study told their children carrots would help them see in the dark. This could be true to some extent because of the high levels of vitamin A and beta-carotene in root vegetables. Another favorite among parents is that milk will make one strong. A third surveyed said their parents told them this, and about 29 per cent said they told their children the same thing. But while there is plenty of evidence to suggest milk is good for people's health, there are also a lot of scientific papers saying it isn't. Thanks to Popeye, spinach is also fed to children, along with the idea that it will make them strong.
