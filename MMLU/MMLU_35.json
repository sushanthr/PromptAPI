Although it began as poque, a French game that developed in New Orleans and headed up the Mississippi steamboats, by the mid-19th century poker was the most popular American amusement; the national game, in effect. So the history of America can be viewed through the history of poker, as James McManus quietly demonstrates.

And it is possible to argue, after reading this book, that history would be different if there were no such game which combined luck, intelligence, dishonesty, courage, skill and character.

Few over here have read or will read Shelby Foote's 2,836-page history of the American civil war, so we can be grateful that McManus provides us with a clear and elegant outline which tells how it was \"the first work of history to explore how the game's wisdom and logic fit into the whole scheme of  _ \".

So many of us look back at our own college years and realize what we could have done differently to make the most of them. While we can't go back, we certainly can offer our sons and daughters our best advice to help them make the right choices in college. Hopefully, they will have fewer regrets than we do. Following are five guidelines parents can share with their college-bound kids to put the whole experience in perspective. EDUCATION IS YOUR FIRST PRIORITY As soon as you arrive on campus, there will be competing interests. Feel free to check them out but always remember that you are there first and foremost for your education. Go to class prepared and on time. Be engaged during class. Make sure your professor knows you and realizes that you care. BE RESPONSIBLE There are many layers of responsibility. Do what you say you will do and, if you can't, own up to it early and communicate clearly. But being responsible isn't just about meeting your commitments; it is also about taking care of you, your body, and your friends. For example, more than 1800 college students die annually from alcohol-related injuries. Look out for yourself and other people. Make moderate, sensible decisions so you aren't reeling from the consequences later. TAKE THE OPPORTUNITY Incredible opportunities will present themselves: studying abroad, interning at a unique place, trying new things. Don't let fear prevent you from taking advantage of them. There may never be so much time or as many resources devoted to your betterment again in your life. Say yes to opportunities that will help you grow. FIND AND BE A MENTOR Some of the best lessons available to us can come outside of the classroom in the form of a mentor. One of the most powerful growth opportunities is being a mentor. Early on, find someone on campus who you feel can help you grow and develop a relationship with him or her. Also find someone for you to mentor. You will reinforce and enrich your own learning experience by teaching someone else. GET THE JOB DONE It is natural to occasionally feel you want to quit, when it makes more sense to you to go find a full-time job. Resist that urge.

Mrs. Liscom, looking pale and worn, was moving languidly   about, trying to clear away the breakfast she had scarcely tasted. She smiled and said, \"You, Fred, you wash dishes?\"    \"Yes, indeed, mother,\" answered Fred. \"I should be a poor scholar if I couldn't, when I've seen you do it so many times. Just try me.\" A look of relief came over his mother's face as she seated herself in her low rocking chair. Fred washed the dishes and put them in the closet. He swept the kitchen, brought up the potatoes from the cellar for the dinner and washed them, and then set out for school. Fred's father was away from home and as there was some cold meat in the pantry  , Mrs. Liscom found it an easy task to prepare dinner. Fred hurried home from school, set the table, and again washed the dishes. He kept on in this way for two or three days, until his mother was able to resume her usual work. He felt amply rewarded when the doctor, who happened in one day, said, \"Well, madam, it's my opinion that you would have been very sick if you had not kept quiet.\" The doctor did not know how the \"quiet\" had been secured, nor how the boy's heart bounded at his words. Fred had given up a great deal of what boys hold dear, for the purpose of helping his mother, coasting and skating being just at this time in perfection. Besides this, his temper and his patience had been severely tried. He had been in the habit of going early to school and staying to play after it was dismissed. The boys missed him and their curiosity was excited when he would give no other reason for not coming to school earlier, or staying after school, than that he was \"Wanted at home.\" \"I'll tell you,\" said Tom Barton, \"I'll find him out, boys-see if I don't!\" So, one morning on his way to school, he called on Fred. As he went around to the side door, he walked lightly and somewhat nearer the kitchen window than was  ly needful. Looking in, he saw Fred standing at the table with a dishcloth in his hand.    Of course he reported this at school, and various were the greetings poor Fred received at recess  .\"Well, you're a brave one to stay at home washing dishes!\"\"Girl boy!\" \"Pretty Bessie!\"\"Lost your apron, haven't you, Polly!\" Fred was not wanting either in spirit or in courage, and he was strongly tempted to resent these insults and to fight some of his tormentors  . But his consciousness of right and his love for his mother helped him.    While he was struggling for self-mastery, his teacher appeared at the door of the schoolhouse. Fred caught his eye, and it seemed to look, if it did not say, \"Don't give up! Be really brave!\" He knew the teacher had heard the insulting taunts of his thoughtless schoolmates.    The boys received notice during the day that Fred must not be taunted in any manner. They knew that the teacher meant what he said; and so the brave little boy had no further trouble.

Mrs. Liscom, looking pale and worn, was moving languidly   about, trying to clear away the breakfast she had scarcely tasted. She smiled and said, \"You, Fred, you wash dishes?\"    \"Yes, indeed, mother,\" answered Fred. \"I should be a poor scholar if I couldn't, when I've seen you do it so many times. Just try me.\" A look of relief came over his mother's face as she seated herself in her low rocking chair. Fred washed the dishes and put them in the closet. He swept the kitchen, brought up the potatoes from the cellar for the dinner and washed them, and then set out for school. Fred's father was away from home and as there was some cold meat in the pantry  , Mrs. Liscom found it an easy task to prepare dinner. Fred hurried home from school, set the table, and again washed the dishes. He kept on in this way for two or three days, until his mother was able to resume her usual work. He felt amply rewarded when the doctor, who happened in one day, said, \"Well, madam, it's my opinion that you would have been very sick if you had not kept quiet.\" The doctor did not know how the \"quiet\" had been secured, nor how the boy's heart bounded at his words.

Bruce is said to have been encouraged by this and to have gone on to defeat the English. Edison, the inventor of the light bulb, made hundreds of models that failed before he found the right way to make one. Once he was asked why he kept on trying to make a new type of battery when he had failed so often, he replied, \"Failure? I have no failure. Now I know 50,000 ways it won't work.\" So what? First, always think about your failure. What caused it? Were conditions right? Were you in top form yourself? What can you change so things will go right next time? Second, is the goal you're trying to reach the right one? Try to do some thinking about what your real goals may be. Think about this question, \"If I do succeed in this, where will it get me?\" This may help you prevent failure in things you shouldn't be doing anyway. The third thing to keep in mind about failure is that it's a part of life. Learn to \"live with yourself\" even though you may have failed. Even if we have failed we should   _  .", "subject": ""}

That is what the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention and the American Heart Association recommend. They say high schools should provide about four hours of physical activity each week. Yet many schools across the country have reduced their physical education programs. Criticism of the cuts has led in some places to efforts to give students more time for exercise, not less. The future health of Americans may depend on it. A study reports that life expectancy has fallen or is no longer increasing in some parts of the United States. The situation is worst among poor people in the southern states, and especially women. Public health researchers say it is largely the result of increases in obesity,smoking and high blood pressure. They also blame differences in health services around the country. In 2006, a study found that only 4% of elementary schools provided daily physical education all year for all grades. This was true of 8% of middle schools and 2% of high schools. The study also found that 22% of all schools did not require students to take any P. E. One problem for P. E. teachers is that schools are under pressure to put more time into academic subjects. Also, parents may agree that children need exercise in school. Yet many parents today still have bad memories of being chosen last for teams because teachers favored the good athletes in class. But experts say P. E. classes have changed. They say the goal has moved away from competition to personal performance, as a way to build a lifetime of activity. These days, teachers often lead activities like weight training and yoga.

{"answer": 2, "choices": ["There was no one to lead it.", "The women did not have any men with them.", "It was a new experience for most of the women.", "The women had not met one another before."], "question": "In 1997, a group of twenty British women made history. Working in five teams with four women in each team, they walked to the North Pole. Apart from one experienced female guide, the other women were all ordinary people who had never done anything like this in their lives before. They managed to survive in an environment which had defeated several very experienced men during the same time period.               The women set off as soon as they were ready. Once on the ice, each woman had to ski along while dragging a sledge weighing over 50 kilos. The temperature was always below the freezing point and sometimes strong winds made walking while pulling so much weight almost impossible. It was also very difficult for them to put up their tents when they stopped each night. In such conditions, the women were making good progress if they covered fourteen or fifteen kilometers a day.

With drugs widely available in the market today, it is still advisable that we consume the best kind of medicine for our body, that is natural drugs. One of the natural resources for a relaxation drug is the Valerian Root Extract. Scientifically known as Valeriana Officinalis, this plant is a flowering type with heads of pink and white flowers mostly blooming in the summer months. Native in Europe and in small parts of Asia, the plant became popular worldwide because of its sweet scent and unique health benefits. Past research suggests that the valerian root has healing characteristics that focus on the neurotransmitter of the brain, which makes the brain cells function well. Other researches about this herb suggest that it can keep a person free of anxiety. Although there are various types of valerian root products in the market today, modern medical studies have concluded that further research has to be taken into consideration before acknowledging the so-called benefits of Valerian Root Extracts. One sample of the so-called benefits is the treatment for anxiety disorder called \"social anxiety disorder\" or SAD. The benefit has _ evidence to support its claim as an alternative relief for anxiety. However, many patients said that they felt improvements on their nervous conditions, stress and overall mental ability. Valerian Root Extract can be acquired as a tea, tablet, or liquid extract.

Scientifically known as Valeriana Officinalis, this plant is a flowering type with heads of pink and white flowers mostly blooming in the summer months. Native in Europe and in small parts of Asia, the plant became popular worldwide because of its sweet scent and unique health benefits. Past research suggests that the valerian root has healing characteristics that focus on the neurotransmitter of the brain, which makes the brain cells function well. Other researches about this herb suggest that it can keep a person free of anxiety. Although there are various types of valerian root products in the market today, modern medical studies have concluded that further research has to be taken into consideration before acknowledging the so-called benefits of Valerian Root Extracts. One sample of the so-called benefits is the treatment for anxiety disorder called \"social anxiety disorder\" or SAD. The benefit has _ evidence to support its claim as an alternative relief for anxiety. However, many patients said that they felt improvements on their nervous conditions, stress and overall mental ability. Valerian Root Extract can be acquired as a tea, tablet, or liquid extract. It is recommended that you consult your physician about this herbal plant if it can really benefit your health. What do we know about Valeriana Officinalis?", "subject": ""}

It plays such an important role in our lives that all fields focus on its study, including one looking at the biology of music. Experts are finding that because of the way our brains process music, learning to play an instrument or just listening to music can have a wide range of benefits. Music education has received a lot of attention. Learning to play an instrument can help children improve math, science, and language skills. One study in Canada tracked children's IQ scores for nine months, discovering that children who studied music had the biggest test score improvements. The secret may lie in the way reading music and playing notes uses several areas of the brain, increasing our ability to learn school subjects. For example, reading notes improves spatial   reasoning skills, which are helpful in solving math problems like fractions . Music is also used for medical purposes, such as the treatment of diseases which affect memory. The secret lies in the way the brain processes music. One area near the forehead, the medial prefrontal cortex, connects music with memories stored in two other areas: the amygdale and hippocampus.

She rolled down the window, fifty feet away from the driveway and spit her gum  out of the window. \"Couldn't you just wait five seconds and put your gum where it belongs?\" I asked, annoyed. She was not the only one who was gum-lazy. Consider the following. Every time I brush chewed gum under my desk, I shake with fright. At Folsom Middle School, whenever I had to walk by the gum wall next to the girls' locker room, I felt totally disgusted. When I was young, I walked outside during my dance show in my ballet shoes, always stepping right on a big and juicy piece of bubble gum. I was extremely upset. The worst part of all these incidents is that a trash can is located near. But some people are too lazy to walk towards it. If you can't be a responsible gum chewer, don't chew at all. That's all I'm going to say. Take Singapore as a good example. The chewing gum ban in Singapore was placed. It bans the import and sale of chewing gum in Singapore, whether for the purpose of trade or personal chewing. However, the ban has been partly lifted with some types of gum, such as medical gum, allowable. This comes with the warning that it is sold only by a druggist, who has to take down the names of buyers. Obviously, the Singapore government gets angry at gum stuck in keyholes of mailboxes and on elevator buttons. Not only is it annoying, but chewing gum can actually do harm to the health. Most gum contains aspartame  , a chemical sweetener that the US government is now deciding whether or not it is a deadly chemical. If it is, it may cause cancer. Other studies suggest that aspartame may cause neurological disorders. Therefore, aspartame is not allowed to use in the US. So just say no to chewing gum.

When I was young, I walked outside during my dance show in my ballet shoes, always stepping right on a big and juicy piece of bubble gum. I was extremely upset. The worst part of all these incidents is that a trash can is located near. But some people are too lazy to walk towards it. If you can't be a responsible gum chewer, don't chew at all. That's all I'm going to say. Take Singapore as a good example. The chewing gum ban in Singapore was placed. It bans the import and sale of chewing gum in Singapore, whether for the purpose of trade or personal chewing. However, the ban has been partly lifted with some types of gum, such as medical gum, allowable. This comes with the warning that it is sold only by a druggist, who has to take down the names of buyers. Obviously, the Singapore government gets angry at gum stuck in keyholes of mailboxes and on elevator buttons. Not only is it annoying, but chewing gum can actually do harm to the health. Most gum contains aspartame  , a chemical sweetener that the US government is now deciding whether or not it is a deadly chemical. If it is, it may cause cancer. Other studies suggest that aspartame may cause neurological disorders. Therefore, aspartame is not allowed to use in the US. So just say no to chewing gum.

{"answer": 1, "choices": ["It has negative effect on people.", "Its effect can differ from person to person.", "It disappears when people return to their homelands.", "It can be avoided if one can understand the language."], "question": "The term, culture shock, describes the anxiety produced when a person moves to a completely new environment. This term expresses the lack of direction, the feeling of not knowing what to do, and not knowing what is appropriate or inappropriate.  The feeling of culture shock generally sets in after the first few weeks of coming to a new place. We can describe culture shock as the physical and emotional discomfort one suffers when coming to live in another country or place. Often, the way that we lived before is not accepted as or considered as normal in the new place.  Everything is different, for example, not speaking the language, not knowing how to use banking machines and so forth. Although one can experience real pain from culture shock, it is also an opportunity for resetting one' s life objectives.  It is a great opportunity for learning and acquiring new viewpoints. Culture shock can make one develop a better understanding of oneself. Culture shock has many stages. The first stage is called the \"honeymoon\" stage. The new arrival may feel excited as everything is new. In the second stage, a person may encounter some difficult times in daily life. For example, communication difficulties may occur such as not being understood. There may be feelings of discontent, anger, sadness, and feeling incompetence. This happens when a person is trying to adapt to a new culture.  Transition   between the old methods and those of the new country is a difficult process and takes time to complete. The third stage is characterized by gaining some understanding of the new culture. One may start to feel a certain psychological balance. The new arrival may start to have a feeling of direction and want to belong. In the fourth stage, the person realizes that the new culture has good and bad things to offer. The person has a more solid feeling of belonging and starts to set goals for living. The fifth stage is called the \" re-entry shock\".  This occurs when a return to the country of origin is made. One may find that things are no longer the same. For example, some of the newly acquired customs are not in use in the old culture. Many factors   contribute to the length and effects of culture shock. For example, the individual's state of mental health, type of personality, previous experiences, familiarity with the language, and level of education. So the five stages are present at different times and each person has their own way of reacting. 64. What do we learn about culture shock? What do we learn about culture shock?", "subject": ""}

{"answer": 2, "choices": ["All advertisements for Coca-Cola in schools will be removed.", "All people approve of banning advertisements for unhealthy food.", "Schools play an important role in forming children's healthy habits.", "The new limits will have a negative effect on all food companies."], "question": "On Tuesday, the White House and the U.S. Department of Agriculture (USDA) set new limits  on advertising food and drinks in schools. The rules ban  advertisements for unhealthy foods in schools. The ad ban includes sugary drinks that account for more than 90% of unhealthy ads. An ad for Coca-Cola, for example, will be removed from a scoreboard   at a high school football game. However, ads for Diet Coke and Dasani water, owned by the same company, are allowed to display . The new rules are part of the First Lady's \"Let's Move\" campaign to fight childhood obesity  . Her goal is to get kids to eat healthier food. The marketing limits came after new USDA regulations that put a limit on the calorie, fat and sugar in most school food items. \"The idea is simple -- our classrooms should be healthy places,\" the First Lady Michelle Obama said. \"Because when parents are working hard to teach their kids healthy habits at home, their work shouldn't be destroyed by unhealthy messages in schools.\" However, the healthier food rules are criticized by people who think the government should not control what kids eat and by some students who don't like the healthier foods. It is reported that food companies spend $149 million a year on marketing foods to kids, and many big companies are supporting the new rules. Coca-Cola and PepsiCo have started to advertise healthier products. For schools, junk food ads like the Coca-Cola scoreboard will be taken down. \"The new limits ensure  that schools remain safe places where kids can learn and eat healthy food,\" Agriculture Secretary Tom Vilsak said.

But what is a whale to do? Natural noise from waves, wind, rain and even earthquakes is common in oceans. Unfortunately, man-made noise from oil and gas drilling, sonar, and ships is also present. Low frequency noise has doubled off the California coast every decade since the nineteen sixties. The main reasons are ships' propellers . They not only generate continuous low frequency sound, some propellers cavitate , which means they create air bubbles that collapse, creating loud popping sounds. Whales use low frequency calls to communicate across thousands of miles of ocean. They are threatened by noise pollution because it can prevent them from contacting each other and from locating their foods. Endangered humpback and right whales, which use fibrous baleen to strain food from the water, are the most at risk. Scientists studying right whales off Canada's east coast have discovered that whales are sending louder calls through the water to make themselves heard. Because they invest more energy in making calls, they have less energy available for finding food and mating. Other scientists measuring whale calls against background noise pollution have discovered that right whales have lost about eighty percent of their normal communication area. This could seriously affect survival of this already threatened species. Scientists don't have badges and guns, but they are trying to correct the noise pollution problem. By tracking ships and marine mammals and understanding how noise travels, they are creating sound maps.

Happily, he decided to hire a maid to relieve his wife from her domestic tasks. He also felt that their three-room flat was no longer big enough. It would be nice for his family to be able to enjoy the facilities and comfort of a condominium.  Having experienced the rewards of his hard work many times before, Father resolved to further his studies and work at being promoted again. The family still did not get to see much of him. In fact, sometimes Father had to work on Sundays entertaining clients.  Over again, whenever the family complained that he was not spending enough time with them, he reasoned that he was doing all this for them. Though he often longed to spend more time with his family, he weighed his contribution to his family above everything else. As expected, Father's hard work paid off again and he bought a beautiful condominium overlooking the coast of Singapore. On the first Sunday evening at their new home, Father declared to his family that he decided not to take any more courses or pursue any more promotions. From then on he was going to devote more time to his family, and it was a promise. Father did not wake up the next day.

The solution may be just a few steps away. \"Energy harvesting\" promises to power countless consumer devices, often with nothing more than your body's movement or heat. Dozens of companies around the world already offer such products, but many experts believe the market for the technology could explode due to electronic devices being developed for the Internet of Things. \"It's huge,\" said Graham Martin, CEO of the EnOcean Alliance, a San Ramon-based group of businesses that promotes wireless energy-harvesting technologies. With the Internet of Things expected to combine billions of devices, \"if they are all battery-powered, we'll have a problem because there's not enough lithium   in the world,\" he added. \"So a lot of them will have to use energy harvesting.\" Among the most basic forms of the technology is body power. When certain materials are squeezed or stretched, the movement of their atoms creates an electrical charge. Automatic watches have employed the concept for decades, for example, by winding themselves when their user moves their arm. Now, the concept is being considered for a number of other devices. In a contest seeking visionary ideas for wearable technologies, Intel awarded $5,000 for a concept to change the temperature difference between a person's body and a special piece of clothing they'd wear into electricity for mobile devices.  Using sound to power devices is another energy-harvesting variation. Stanford University engineers are testing smart microchips   that create electricity from ultrasound   to power implantable   devices that can analyze a person's nervous system or treat their diseases. A textile   research association in Spain is proposing to obtain electricity from radio waves that flow around everyone to power sensors sewn into clothes, which can monitor a person's heartbeat or other vital signs. Research firm IDTechEx has estimated that annual global sales of energy-harvesting products could hit $2.6 billion by 2024, while WinterGreen Research predicts sales of $4.2 billion by 2019. Obtaining stable energy from devices can be complex, however. For one thing, the motion that generates the electricity has to be constant to be useful. Moreover, the amount of power the devices produce depends on the person using them, according to a Columbia University study. It determined that taller people on average provide about 20 percent more power than shorter ones when walking, running or cycling. It's also unclear how eagerly consumers might welcome energy-harvesting products.

With the Internet of Things expected to combine billions of devices, \"if they are all battery-powered, we'll have a problem because there's not enough lithium   in the world,\" he added. \"So a lot of them will have to use energy harvesting.\" Among the most basic forms of the technology is body power. When certain materials are squeezed or stretched, the movement of their atoms creates an electrical charge. Automatic watches have employed the concept for decades, for example, by winding themselves when their user moves their arm. Now, the concept is being considered for a number of other devices. In a contest seeking visionary ideas for wearable technologies, Intel awarded $5,000 for a concept to change the temperature difference between a person's body and a special piece of clothing they'd wear into electricity for mobile devices.  Using sound to power devices is another energy-harvesting variation. Stanford University engineers are testing smart microchips   that create electricity from ultrasound   to power implantable   devices that can analyze a person's nervous system or treat their diseases. A textile   research association in Spain is proposing to obtain electricity from radio waves that flow around everyone to power sensors sewn into clothes, which can monitor a person's heartbeat or other vital signs. Research firm IDTechEx has estimated that annual global sales of energy-harvesting products could hit $2.6 billion by 2024, while WinterGreen Research predicts sales of $4.2 billion by 2019. Obtaining stable energy from devices can be complex, however. For one thing, the motion that generates the electricity has to be constant to be useful. Moreover, the amount of power the devices produce depends on the person using them, according to a Columbia University study. It determined that taller people on average provide about 20 percent more power than shorter ones when walking, running or cycling. It's also unclear how eagerly consumers might welcome energy-harvesting products. While such devices are expected to cost less than battery-powered alternatives when compared over many years, experts say, people may continue buying ones with batteries merely because those would be cheaper in the short term.

In the study, women who were new mothers scored better on tests of visuospatial memory - the ability to understand and remember information about their surroundings--compared with women who didn't have children. The findings contradicts the old belief that women develop\"baby brain\" or a decline in memory and cognitive  function, after they have kids, said study researcher Melissa Santiago, a doctoral student at Carlos Albizu University in Miami. \"You don't have to feel that because you have kids, your memory isn't the same,\" Santiago said. The study was small, and the findings will have to be tested in larger groups of people, Santiago said.

Studies on rats show those with pups have better memory than those without offspring.

To test visuospatial memory, the women were shown a paper containing six symbols for 10 seconds, and then asked to draw what they remembered. This task was repeated several times.

I know because I asked. I put the question to top-flight professionals in industries from tech to finance to media, all of whom had serious ( if often little-known) past lives as musicians. Almost all made a connection between their music training and their professional achievements. Will your school music program turn your kid into a Paul Allen, the billionaire co-founder of Microsoft (guitar)? Or a Woody Allen (clarinet )? Probably not. These are outstanding achievers. But the way these and other visionaries   I spoke to process music is interesting. But the key question is: why does that connection exist? Paul Allen offers an answer. He says music \"establish your confidence in the ability to create.\" He began playing the violin at age 7 and switched to the guitar as a teenager. Even in the early days of Microsoft, he would pick up his guitar at the end of marathon days of programming. The music was the emotional analog   to his day job, both of them show his different creativity. He says, \"something is pushing you to look beyond what currently exists and express yourself in a new way.\" For many of the high achievers I spoke with, music functions as a \"hidden language,\" as Mr. Wolfensohn calls it, one that enhances the ability to connect different or even opposite ideas. When he ran the World Band, Mr. Wolfensohn traveled to more than 100 countries, often taking in local performances (and occasionally joining in on a borrowed cello), which helped him understand \"the culture of people\". Consider the qualities these high achievers say music has sharpened : cooperation, creativity, discipline and the capacity to coordinate   conflicting ideas.

{"answer": 1, "choices": ["change London's skyline", "inherit London's tradition", "imitate the Egyptian style", "attract potential visitors"], "question": "London's newest skyscraper  is called the Shard and it cost about 430 million pounds to build. At a height of almost 310 metres, it is the tallest building in Europe. The Shard has completely changed the appearance of London. However, not everyone thinks that it is a change for the better. The Shard was designed by the famous Italian architect Renzo Piano. When he began designing the Shard for London, Piano wanted a very tall building that looked like a spire  * He wanted the glass surfaces to reflect the sky and the city. The sides of the building aren't regular. So the building has an unusual shape. It looks like a very thin,sharp piece of broken glass. And that is how the building got the name: the Shard. Piano says that the spire shape of the Shard is part of a great London tradition. The shape reminds him of the spires of the churches of London or the tall masts  of the ships that were once on the river Thames. The Shard has 87 floors. At the top, there is an observatory. At the moment the building is empty, but eventually there will be a five-star hotel. There will also be top quality restaurants, apartments and offices. Before building work began, a lot of people didn't want the Shard though the plans were approved. Now they are still unhappy about the Shard. Some critics say that such a tall skyscraper might be good in a city like New York, but not in London. They say that the best thing about the Shard is its spire shape. But that is the only thing.

The G700Tactical Flashlight is currently the most popular tactical flashlight of choice for most American's due to its powerfully disorienting\"strobe mode\"that allows the user to flash a blinding light into the attackers eyes,leaving them\"disoriented beyond belief.\" How effective are tactical flashlights,really? If you've ever had someone take a picture of you at night with the flash on,you'll know how it takes a minute or two for your eyes to re-adjust.Now imagine that flash is 100x brighter and is strobing directly into your eyes.You wouldn't be able to see a thing,and would most likely lose your sense of balance. That's what you get with a tactical flashlight like the G700Tactical Flashlight.The strobe feature is designed to ruin an attacker's eye sight,so they can't see what they're doing,letting you safely run away-or if need be,gain the advantage and attack them.

{"answer": 1, "choices": ["Temperature change.", "NIR light.", "Acidity change.", "UV light."], "question": "Medical drugs sometimes cause more damage than they cure. One solution to this problem is to put the drugs inside a capsule, protecting them from the body--and the body from them--until they can be released at just the right spot. There are lots of ways to trigger   this release, including changing temperature, acidity, and so on. But triggers can come with their own risks--burns, for example. Now, researchers in California have designed what could be a harmless trigger to date: shining near-infrared light (NIR, ) on the drug in the capsule. The idea of using light to liberate the drug in the capsule isn't new. Researchers around the globe have developed polymers   and other materials that begin to break down when they absorb either ultraviolet (UV, ) or visible light. But tissues also readily absorb UV and visible light, which means the drug release can be triggered only near the skin, where the light can reach the capsule. NIR light largely passes through tissues, so researchers have tried to use it as a trigger. But few compounds   absorb NIR well and go through chemical changes. That changed last year when Adah Almutairi, a chemist at the University of California, San Diego, reported that she and her colleagues had designed a polymer that breaks down when it absorbs NIR light. Their polymer used a commercially available NIR-absorbing group called o-nitrobenzyl (ONB). When they catch the light, ONB groups fall off the polymer, leading to its breakdown. But ONB is only a so-so NIR absorber, and it could be poisonous to cells when it separates from the polymer. So Almutairi and her colleagues reported creating a new material for capsules that's even better.This one consists of a long chain of compounds called cresol groups linked in a polymer. Cresol contains reactive  components that make it highly unstable in its polymeric form, a feature Almutairi and her colleagues use to their advantage. After polymerizing the cresols, they cap each reactive component with a light-absorbing compound called Bhc. When the Bhcs absorb NIR light, the reactive groups are exposed and break the long polymer into two short chains. Shining additional light continues this breakdown, potentially releasing any drugs in the capsule. What's more, Almutairi says, Bhc is 10 times better at absorbing NIR than is ONB and is not poisonous to cells.

To  reduce  the  country's  addiction  to  private,  after-hours  tutoring  academies(called  hagwons),  the  authorities  have  begun  enforcing  a  curfew --even  rewarding  citizens  for  turning  in  violators.

M. Hillyer, the first headmaster of Calvert School, spent many of his school years studying only American history. Believing that studying world history would broaden children's horizons and give them a better understanding of the world and history in general, he set out to write an understandable and comprehensive world history children could enjoy. A Child's History of the World functions to familiarize young children with some historical events and people of significance while reading like a good story. The subjects are covered in chronological order, from the beginning of the world through the end of the Cold War. This gives the child a linear view of world history that allows the details to be filled in later. A Child's History of the World is a basic reader and is not intended to be used as a supplementary reader. Customer Reviews This is a must-have book.

Love the way it is written. Katrena R. from Shingle Springs, CA This is a great book. Everyone (elementary/primary aged) should have this book in their homeschooling library.

There is fly fishing which is with a lighter string and top water jigs such as bugs that lay on the top of the water until the trout comes and takes it. It takes longer to reel them in because the line is so light and the fish are heavy. Ice fishing is a dangerous kind of fishing in the north. You cut a hole in the ice, drop in your bait and wait for a fish to bite. You have to be careful that the fish doesn't pull your line into the side of the ice and snap it.

Languages usually have a relatively short life span as well as a very high death rate. Only a few, including Egyptian, Chinese, Greek, Latin, have lasted more than 2,000 years. What is new, however, is the speed at which they are dying out. Europe's colonial conquests caused a sharp decline in linguistic diversity, eliminating at least 15 percent of all languages spoken at the time. Over the last 300 years, Europe has lost a dozen, and Australia has only 20 left of the 250 spoken at the end of the 18th century. The rise of nation-states has also been decisive in selecting and consolidating national languages and sidelining others. By making great efforts to establish an official language in education, the media and the civil service, national governments have deliberately tried to eliminate minority languages. This process of linguistic standardization has been boosted by industrialization and scientific progress, which have imposed new methods of communication that are swift, straightforward and practical. Language diversity came to be seen as an obstacle to trade and the spread of knowledge. Monolingualism became an ideal. More recently, the internationalization of financial markets, the spread of information by electronic media and other aspects of globalization have intensified the threat to \"small\" languages. A language not on the Internet is a language that \"no longer exists\" in the modern world. It is out of the game. The serious effects of the death of languages are evident.

Multilingualism is the most accurate reflection of multiculturalism. The destruction of the first will inevitably lead to the loss of the second.

Your neighbour or a super star? A few people have experienced what it might be like to step into the skin of another person, thanks to an unusual virtual reality device. Rikke Wahl, an actress, model and artist, was one of the participants in a body swapping experiment at the Be Another lab, a project developed by a group of artists based in Barcelona. She swapped with her partner, an actor, using a machine called The Machine to Be Another and temporarily became a man. \"As I looked down, I saw my whole body as a man, dressed in my partner's pants,\" she said. \"That's the picture I remember best.\" The set-up is relatively simple. Both users wear a virtual reality headset with a camera on the top. The video from each camera is sent to the other person, so what you see is the exact view of your partner. If she moves her arm, you see it. If you move your arm, she sees it. To get used to seeing another person's body without actually having control of it, participants start by raising their arms and legs very slowly, so that the other can follow along. Eventually, this kind of slow synchronised movement becomes comfortable, and participants really start to feel as though they are living in another person's body. Using such technology promises to alter people's behaviour afterwards-potentially for the better. Studies have shown that virtual reality can be effective in fighting racism-the bias that humans have against those who don't look or sound like them. Researchers at the University of Barcelona gave people a questionnaire called the Implicit Association Test, which measures the strength of people's associations between, for instance, black people and adjectives such as good, bad, athletic or awkward. Then they asked them to control the body of a dark skinned digital character using virtual reality glasses, before taking the test again. This time, the participants' bias scores were lower. The idea is that once you've \"put yourself in another's shoes\" you're less likely to think ill of them, because your brain has internalised the feeling of being that person. The creators of The Machine to Be Another hope to achieve a similar result. \"At the end of body swapping, people feel like holding each other in their arms,\" says Arthur Pointeau, a programmer with the project. \"It's a really nice way to have this kind of experience.

However, it is usually a qualified \"no\" that says what, where, when, and under what conditions you will give or not give to another person. There are three points we should keep in mind about limit setting: 1.Decide where to set the limits. Think about the entire situation. Consider your time, emotions, and means. Then consider whether you are helping the other person. Aim to do something to help the other person without taking on the whole problem. 2.Express the limits clearly. For example, you say to your friend, \" I will lend you $20,000 no more than once every three months. And I expect you will pay me back within three months and certainly before you can borrow more.\" You say to another friend, \"you can stay here for three weeks but you must help me with expenses and cooking and make sure that you will find your own place before the three weeks is up\". 3.Stick to your limits. You are not responsible for making the other person obey the limits. You are only responsible for following the limits yourself.

Still, many child-development experts agree that tying a child's allowance to chores can be a slippery slope. Here's why. Susie Walton, master instructor at Peace in Your Home advises to keep chores and allowances totally separate. \"Allowance is one thing. When it comes to chores, life skills, responsibilities-that's a whole different thing.\" says Walton. Walton says, \"When kids aren't doing a chore, you don't say, 'well, there goes your allowance.' You're going to sit them down and ask what's going on. 'We are a team. We are a family. We've got to have them done.'\" Besides, by paying children for chores with an allowance, you'll also be sending the message that work isn't worth doing unless they're getting paid for it. There are times when it would make sense to pay kids for chores. Most financial and child-development experts agree that it's a fine idea to pay children money for extra jobs that are outside their normal set of chores, such as washing windows, washing the car or helping to clean out the garage-especially if the child is saving for a big item. This may even develop an entrepreneurial   spirit to think outside of the box to earn money. For parents who are concerned that their children won't learn the value of a dollar if the allowance isn't tied to household chores, note that there are still plenty of money management skills to be learned from a straight allowance. Depending on the age, kids can be made responsible for paying for their own toys or snacks. Some parents even require that kids set aside a percentage of their allowance toward savings. \"I really like having my own money,\" says Kevin, 9. \"It's up to me if I want to buy the cheap toy now, or save and get the better toy.\" And that's a good lesson to learn at 9 years old.

From the beginning, Barbie was a modern career  girl.

However, Barbie's approval  as a role model has not lasted. Today, many people criticize  Barbie for making young girls too concerned about their appearance .

No, sir, when a man is tired of London, he is tired of life, for there is in London all that life can afford.\" More than two centuries have passed since Johnson's age, but his words still ring true. Here, you'll find the historic Tower of London and the Tate Modern both considered must-sees. Shakespeare's sonnets  are still being uttered by actors. Londoners most certainly still look up to the royals, but they also rock out to Coldplay and Lily Allen. And while they still sip tea, they now drink Starbucks, too. How to Save Money in London Find the free attractions. Many of London's top things to do, including the National Gallery, Hyde Park and the Portobello Road Market, are absolutely free to enjoy. Ride the Tube. Taking taxis will add up quickly, so buy a pay-as-you-go Oyster Card and travel on London's underground system, nicknamed the \"Tube\". Dine smart. Corridors like Brick Lane offer fantastic cultural food for bargain prices; fish and chip shops are a cheap standby and takeaway food costs less than dine-in. London Culture & Customs London is one of the fashion capitals of the world, and its residents tend to reflect that. Practically, pack an umbrella for the rainy days and a scarf for the cold ones. As for tipping, restaurants and cafes will usually add a 10-to-15-percent service charge to the bill. If a service charge is not allotted , it's customary to tip the same (between 10 and 15 percent). If you're drinking at a pub or wine bar, tipping is flexible. And in a taxicab, tip the driver to the nearest pound or about 10 percent of the cost. London Dining London used to be highly criticized for its heavy and common menu items. Now, London is considered as one of the most gourmet cities in the world. And with its melting pot of cultures, it's not difficult to see why. London offers everything from modern British to Malaysian. For Indian food, we suggest visiting the curry houses on Brick Lane. If you want a real high tea experience, book reservations at the Ritz, at Fortnum & Mason, or at the Dorchester -- but be sure to dress the part. Pub culture is still alive and well, so if you have a _ for fried fish and salty chips (or French fries), you'll still find them here. And for a quick bite, exchange a few pounds for a kebab, a quick sandwich or some to go sushi, which can be found in restaurants throughout the city.

Recently, the UK National Stem Cell Network warned the UK could lose its place among the world leaders in stem cell research unless adequate funding and legislation could be assured, despite an annual PS40m spent by the Department of Health on all kinds of research. However, we do have to challenge the unthinking complaint that the sector does not do enough in taking ideas to market. The most recent comparative data on the performance of universities and research institutions in Australia, Canada, USA and UK shows that, from a relatively weak starting position, the UK now leads on many indicators of commercialization activity. When viewed at the national level, the _ (interference) of the past decade have helped transformed the performances of UK universities. Evidence suggests the UK's position is much stronger than in the recent past and is still showing improvement. But national data masks the very large variation in the performance of individual universities. The evidence shows that a large number of universities have fallen off the back of the pack, a few perform strongly and the rest chase the leaders. This type of uneven distribution is not strange to the UK and is mirrored across other economies. In the UK, research is concentrated: less than 25% of universities are receiving 75% of the research funding. These same universities are also the institutions producing the greatest share of PhD graduates, science citations, patents and license income. The effect of policies generating long-term resource concentration has also created a distinctive set of universities which are research-led and commercially active. It seems clear that the concentration of research and commercialization work creates differences between universities. The core objective for universities which are research-led must be to maximize the impact of their research efforts. Their purpose is not to generate funds to add to the bottom line of the university or to substitute other income streams. Rather, these universities should be generating the widest range of social, economic and environmental benefits. In return for the scale of investment, they should share their expertise (expert knowledge or skill) in order to build greater confidence in the sector. Part of the economic recovery of the UK will be driven by the next generation of research commercialization spilling out of our universities. On the evidence presented in my report, there are three dozen universities in the UK which are actively engaged in advanced research training and commercialization work. If there was a greater coordination of technology transfer offices within regions and a simultaneous (happening at the same time) investment in the scale and functions of our graduate schools, universities could, and should, play a key role in positioning the UK for the next growth cycle.

Recently, the UK National Stem Cell Network warned the UK could lose its place among the world leaders in stem cell research unless adequate funding and legislation could be assured, despite an annual PS40m spent by the Department of Health on all kinds of research. However, we do have to challenge the unthinking complaint that the sector does not do enough in taking ideas to market. The most recent comparative data on the performance of universities and research institutions in Australia, Canada, USA and UK shows that, from a relatively weak starting position, the UK now leads on many indicators of commercialization activity. When viewed at the national level, the _ (interference) of the past decade have helped transformed the performances of UK universities. Evidence suggests the UK's position is much stronger than in the recent past and is still showing improvement. But national data masks the very large variation in the performance of individual universities. The evidence shows that a large number of universities have fallen off the back of the pack, a few perform strongly and the rest chase the leaders. This type of uneven distribution is not strange to the UK and is mirrored across other economies. In the UK, research is concentrated: less than 25% of universities are receiving 75% of the research funding. These same universities are also the institutions producing the greatest share of PhD graduates, science citations, patents and license income. The effect of policies generating long-term resource concentration has also created a distinctive set of universities which are research-led and commercially active. It seems clear that the concentration of research and commercialization work creates differences between universities. The core objective for universities which are research-led must be to maximize the impact of their research efforts. Their purpose is not to generate funds to add to the bottom line of the university or to substitute other income streams. Rather, these universities should be generating the widest range of social, economic and environmental benefits. In return for the scale of investment, they should share their expertise (expert knowledge or skill) in order to build greater confidence in the sector. Part of the economic recovery of the UK will be driven by the next generation of research commercialization spilling out of our universities. On the evidence presented in my report, there are three dozen universities in the UK which are actively engaged in advanced research training and commercialization work. If there was a greater coordination of technology transfer offices within regions and a simultaneous (happening at the same time) investment in the scale and functions of our graduate schools, universities could, and should, play a key role in positioning the UK for the next growth cycle.

I'm Lucy the ladybird and while I'm very much of a lady, I'm not actually a bird but a glowing red bettle with decorative black spots. I'm a friendly little bug, to be honest, and simply like to be close with my pals as long as they handle me very gently. I don't bite humans but I do sink my teeth into aphids   which, unlike me, are very harmful to all the plants. I milk the aphids just like people do with cows and I milk them dry of all the sap   they have got from your poor plants. I'm a real gardeners' friend and love helping out around the place by pollinating   flowers, tidying up plants' fallen leaves and helping to turn them into nice rich fertilizer to feed everything both above and below the soil, and naturally, being so attractive to look at, we are perfect living garden decorations.  One thing I can not tolerate is all that poisonous pollution from vehicles, garbage burning and other environmentally unfriendly acts that occur in the cities every single minute of the day and night. Pollution of any kind really chokes me to death, so these days, I only live in clean countryside areas, particularly cool ones where it rains and everything grows fresh and green from spring right through to autumn. In winter, when the weather is too cold for me to bear, then I find a nice place to sleep until the snow has gone and I can come back out to play. Oh! I almost forgot to tell you that although I am not a bird I do have wings and can fly for short distances.

While there, I was attentive to Korean high schools and students. I was surprised by how different Korea's public high schools are from America's. Korean high schools can be all-girls, all-boys or co-ed   unlike our standard co-ed high schools. There are three grades: \"go 1\" (10th), \"go 2\" (11th) and \"go 3\" (12th). ''Go\" is the first syllable of the word \"go-deung-hakkyo\", which, simply translated, is \"high school\". In America, unless you want to go to a private school, you don't have to take an entrance exam. In Korea, however, students must take a test to get in because of the many choices of schools. Another difference I couldn't help but notice was the students' appearance. With very few exceptions, all wear uniforms. A name tag   with the student's name, grade and homeroom number must also be worn. Girl's skirts can't be above the upper part of the knee, and it is forbidden to dye   your hair or wear accessories   except small earrings. There are strict regulations for appearance to achieve neatness, and it seems the only freedom students have is with their choices of hair style, socks and shoes. The final difference was the _ of the classes. There may be 40 students in a classroom, but the number can be less or even more, depending on the population of the town or city. Although there are many students per classroom, they are very close, which I think is a result of not changing classrooms for different subjects. There are no levels in the subjects and the teachers are the ones who switch classrooms. They just have ten-minute breaks between subjects. In each class, students are ranked by their grades. This causes strict competition, and Korean students do a lot of studying. To help them, all schools have extra study classes after school. One other fact that helped me appreciate living in America is that Koreans have school on Saturdays. Although it's only a half day, I think I speak for most Americans when I say we could never imagine ourselves in school on a Saturday.

Bill Wyman, former bass player  in the Rolling Stones, has pointed out that music video games discourage kids from learning to play real instruments. My own opinion suggest quite opposite. Last year, I bought Guitar Hero III for our 14-year-old son, Jack. Jack quickly mastered the process and entered an intense period of playing the game. A few months later, while I was away on tour, a couple of his friends came around with a real electric guitar. Playing Guitar Hero had taught them how to play along the track. Now they wanted to see if they could apply that to the real thing. Jack's friends taught him how to play along to his favorite songs using just his index finger  on the bass string. He got it right away. Guitar Hero had helped him over the first difficulty for guitar players--how to strum  the strings with one hand while making chord  shapes with the other. He never plays Guitar Hero now, preferring to rock out in the garage with his mates. Despite my attempts at getting him to learn an instrument, it was Guitar Hero that taught him the basics of playing and built up his confidence to the extent that he was able to make a recognizable sound the first time he played it. So let's not complain about a game that encourages kids to become music fans and, in our son's case, gives them the basic skills needed to learn how to play guitar.

During the climb, Corbett took the lead, hit in the metal spikes that guided the ropes and climbed up. Then, after Wellman pulled himself up the rope, Corbett went down to remove the spikes and climbed up again. This process was repeated time and again, inch by inch, for 13 days. Wellman's job was not easy either. He got himself up the rope through upper body strength alone. In all, Wellman figured that he had done 5,000 pull-ups up the rope on the climb.

In the last ten years, five of the six novels have been made into Hollywood films, while her books continue to be bestsellers. So why is Austen still popular?

They arrive one by one, but they tend to live out their lives two-by-two. \"Every elephant that comes here searches out someone that she then spends most all of her time with,\" says sanctuary co-founder Carol Buckley. It's likely having a best girlfriend, Buckley says - \"Somebody they can relate to, they have something in common with.\" Debbie has Ronnie. Misty can't live without Dulary. _ But perhaps the closest friends of all are Tarra and Bella. Tarra, an 8,700 pound Asian elephant; Bella, a stray dog, are closest friends. Bella is one of more than a dozen stray dogs that have found a home at the sanctuary. Most want nothing to do with the elephants and vice versa. But not this odd couple. \"Bella knows she's not an elephant. Tarra knows she's not a dog,\" Buckley adds. \"But that's not a problem for them.\" \"When it's time to eat they both eat together. They drink together. They sleep together. They play together,\" Buckley says. Tarra and Bella have been close for years -- but no one really knew how close they were until recently. A few months ago Bella suffered a spinal cord injury. She couldn't move her legs, couldn't even wag her tail. For three weeks the dog lay motionless up in the sanctuary office. And for three weeks the elephant held vigil: 2,700 acres to roam free, and Tarra just stood in the corner, beside a gate, right outside that sanctuary office. \"She just stood outside the balcony - just stood there and waited,\" says Buckley. \"She was concerned about her friend.\" Then one day, sanctuary co-founder Scott Blais carried Bella onto the balcony so she and Tarra could at least see each other. \"Bella's tail started wagging. And we had no choice but to bring Bella down to see Tarra,\" Blais says. They visited like that every day until Bella could walk. Today, their love -- and trust -- is stronger than ever. Bella even lets Tarra pet her tummy - with the bottom of her enormous foot. They harbor no fears, no secrets, no prejudices. Just two living creatures who somehow managed to look past their immense differences. Take a good look at this couple, human beings. Take a good look at the world.

DeLuca rented a storefront   in Connecticut, and when they couldn't cover their start-up costs, Buck kicked in another $1000. But business didn't go smoothly as they expected.

They'd meet Monday evenings and brainstorm ideas for keeping the business running. \"We convinced ourselves to open a second store. We figured we could tell the public, 'We are so successful, we are opening a second store.'\" And they did--in the spring of 1966. Still, it was a lot of learning by trial and error. But the partners' learn-as-you-go approach turned out to be their greatest strength. Every Friday, DeLuca would drive around and hand-deliver the checks to pay their suppliers. \"It probably took me two and a half hours and it wasn't necessary, but as a result, the suppliers got to know me very well, and the personal relationships established really helped out,\" DeLuca says.

{"answer": 3, "choices": ["Wealthy parents do better in raising children.", "Differences exist between poor children and rich ones.", "Poor children study harder due to their financial conditions.", "Poor children have thinner neocortex than their wealthy peers."], "question": "New research shows that kids from low-income families may be falling behind their peers because an important part of their brains is underdeveloped. Researchers from MIT' s McGovern Institute for Brain Research compared the brains of 12-and 13-year-olds from rich families with the brains of their peers from lower-income families. They found that one particular area of the brain--the neocortex ,which plays a key role in memory and learning ability--is thinner in children from lower-income households. This is a _ part of the brain for young students, who are often tested based on their ability to recall large chunks of information. Children who had a thinner neocortex performed poorly on standardized tests,researchers found.More than 90% of high-income students scored above average on a statewide math and English/Language Arts standardized test,compared with less than 60% of low-income students.Differences in cortical  thickness could account for almost half of the income-achievement gap in this sample,researchers wrote. \"Just as you would expect, there' s a real cost not living in a supportive environment. We can see it not only in test scores,in educational attainment,but within the brains of these children,\"says psychological scientist John Gabrieli,a professor of brain and cognitive sciences at MIT and one of the study's authors. Since a 2011 study published by Stanford University professor Sean Reardon found that the gap between standardized test scores of high-income and low-income students has grown by about 40% since the 1960s,there' s been a lot of research aimed at finding links between income and achievement, rather than race alone. The MIT study found low-income children were equally likely to have a thinner neocortex,no matter their races. Gabrieli and his co-authors can' t say exactly why poor children' s brains develop differently because there are too many possibilities to count.Their findings do,however,underline the importance of early intervention  to ensure that low-income kids get the tools they need to succeed.

When the moon is round and full, the shadows  of the moon mountains and the lines of the moon valleys sometimes seem to show a giant nose and mouth and eyes. At least, some people think so. If there were a man on the moon--instead of mountains and valleys that just look like the face of a man--what would he be like? He would not be like anyone you know. He would not be like anyone anybody knows. If the man on the moon were bothered by too much heat or cold the way Earth people are, he could not stay on the moon. The moon becomes very, very hot. It becomes as hot as boiling water. And the moon becomes very, very cold. It becomes colder than ice. Whatever part of the moon the sun shines on is hot and bright. The rest of the moon is cold and dark. If the man on the moon had to breathe to stay alive, he couldn't live on the moon because there's no air there. He'd have to carry an oxygen tank, as astronauts do. There's no food on the moon, either. Nothing grows--not even weeds(grass). If the man on the moon liked to climb mountains, he would be very happy. There are many high places there, such as the raised land around the holes, or craters , of the moon. Some of these _ are as tall as Earth's highest mountains. But if the man on the moon liked to swim, he would be unhappy. There is no water on the moon--just dust and rock. When you think of what it's like on the moon, you may wonder why it interests our scientists. One reason is that the moon is Earth's nearest neighbor--it is the easiest place in space to get to. Going back and forth between the moon and Earth, astronauts will get a lot of practice in space travel. Things learned on moon trips will be of great help to astronauts who later take long, long trips to some of the planets. Scientists are also interested in the moon because it has no air.

When the moon is round and full, the shadows  of the moon mountains and the lines of the moon valleys sometimes seem to show a giant nose and mouth and eyes. At least, some people think so. If there were a man on the moon--instead of mountains and valleys that just look like the face of a man--what would he be like? He would not be like anyone you know. He would not be like anyone anybody knows. If the man on the moon were bothered by too much heat or cold the way Earth people are, he could not stay on the moon. The moon becomes very, very hot. It becomes as hot as boiling water. And the moon becomes very, very cold. It becomes colder than ice. Whatever part of the moon the sun shines on is hot and bright. The rest of the moon is cold and dark. If the man on the moon had to breathe to stay alive, he couldn't live on the moon because there's no air there. He'd have to carry an oxygen tank, as astronauts do. There's no food on the moon, either. Nothing grows--not even weeds(grass). If the man on the moon liked to climb mountains, he would be very happy. There are many high places there, such as the raised land around the holes, or craters , of the moon. Some of these _ are as tall as Earth's highest mountains. But if the man on the moon liked to swim, he would be unhappy. There is no water on the moon--just dust and rock. When you think of what it's like on the moon, you may wonder why it interests our scientists. One reason is that the moon is Earth's nearest neighbor--it is the easiest place in space to get to. Going back and forth between the moon and Earth, astronauts will get a lot of practice in space travel. Things learned on moon trips will be of great help to astronauts who later take long, long trips to some of the planets. Scientists are also interested in the moon because it has no air. The air that surrounds Earth cuts down the view of the scientists who look at the stars through telescopes. A telescope on the moon would give them a clearer, closer view of the stars.(words: 411) What is the main thought of the passage?", "subject": ""}

Examples of prejudice in schools include believing that some students are particular type of people simply because of the way they dress or act, or believing that a certain group is good at sports simply because many peop1e in that group are goad at sports. Another example is believing that a boy is good at science because many boys are good at science.     I would like to cite more examples from the English literature. The best example of \"prejudice\" can be found in Jane Austen's novels. Her novels in the history of English literature are popularly known as \"novels of manners\".Thus you can clearly understand that where manners and social behavior are concerned,\"prejudice\" is inevitable ! Austen' s famous novel Pride and Prejudice is the best example in this respect. When you read the novel, the very first line that would strike you is \"it is a truth universally acknowledged, that a single man in possession of a good fortune must be in want of a wife.\"It is an example of 18th century English middle class prejudice that eventually looked upon women just as an object that would serve as the basic sign for a man to establish his manliness and his superior and well acquired financial status. This novel is chiefly about class division,social norms and the consequent human behavior. The characters Elizabeth and Darcy,in their journey of 1ife through the course of the novel, highlight their personal prejudices towards one another that arise from their different social strata .Darcy,a rich man , at first , fails to admire the beauty and intelligence of Elizabeth because of her low social status:\"she is tolerable; but not handsome enough to tempt me;\"and Elizabeth,proud of her \"first impressions\",failed to understand the well natured man under the proud and unfriendly Darcy.

And they all had the same statement:\"All I'm asking for is a little respect seeing I pay you PS9,000 a year.\" I still don't know what led to this flyer campaign -- it is said that it's linked to a group of students who were not given extra assignment grade for their examination -- but I could not help but become annoyed at the impolite language.

The Queen is head of the UK and the Commonwealth. She has important formal duties that go with her different titles. As Head of State, for example, she represents the UK on visits abroad and invites other world leaders to visit the UK;as Head of the Armed Forces in name, only she can declare when the UK is at war or when a war is over. She has to sign many government and Commonwealth documents every day. Although the royal family does the work for the UK, there are British people called\"anti-monarchists \"who do not believe there should be a royal family.

{"answer": 0, "choices": ["To seek freedom.", "To seek wealth.", "To seek good education.", "To seek a good job."], "question": "What Is Today's American Dream They may not have called it the American Dream, but for centuries people have gone to America in search of freer, happier, and richer lives. But is today's American Dream a mythical concept or still a reality? Isabel Belarsky's tiny Brooklyn apartment fills with the sound of her father's voice. Sidor Belarsky sings an Aria in Russian and 90-year-old Isabel, her lips painted an elegant red, sways gently to the song coming from her stereo. Isabel speaks with pride about her father's talent and his success as an opera singer: Albert Einstein was such a fan she says that he invited Sidor to accompany him on his speaking engagements and would ask him to sing to the audience. How the Belarskys came to be in America is an extraordinary tale that Isabel loves to tell. It was the offer of a six-month job by a Mormon college president, who had seen Sidor singing in Leningrad, that enabled the Belarskys to escape from Stalin's Russia in 1930. \"Our dream was being in America,\" Isabel says. \"They loved it. My mother could never think of Russia, it was her enemy and my father, he made such a wonderful career here.\" Like generations of immigrants before them, the Belarskys came to America in search of freedom--to them the American Dream meant liberty. But Isabel says it promised even more. \"The dream is to work, to have a home and to get ahead. You can start as a janitor and become the owner of the building.\" The American Dream is not written into the constitution but it is so ingrained in the national psyche that it might as well be. Many point to the second sentence in the Declaration of Independence--the \"certain unalienable rights\" that include \"life, liberty and the pursuit of happiness\" as the \"official\" version of the phrase. But it was actually in 1931 that the term was popularized, when historian James Truslow Adams wrote in The Epic of America that the Dream means \"a better, richer, and happier life for all our citizens of every rank\". The concept of the American Dream has not stayed static. For European immigrants, like Isabel, fleeing persecution in the first half of the last century, the Dream was about a life without persecution.  But somewhere in the middle of the last century the dream changed. As America's post war economy boomed, the new arrivals wanted more than freedom--they wanted a share of the prosperity as well.  In the 1950s, TV commercials featured housewives proudly showing off kitchens filled with gleaming appliances. The quest for liberation became a quest for Coca Cola. As the century wore on, the materialistic slant of the dream overtook the political side. Dallas and Dynasty suggested this was a country where it was possible to become not just rich, but filthily rich. Cheyanne Smith was shocked at the deprivation that greeted her in America. She arrived in New York from the Caribbean seven years ago. Having watched endless American TV shows as a child, she thought she knew what to expect when her family moved to Brooklyn. Instead, the deprivation of one of New York's poorest neighbourhoods shocked her. \"I thought this is not America because this is not what I see on television,\" she says. Like Cheyanne, 18-year-old Franscisco Curiel is also ambitious. He came from Mexico City three years ago to go to college here but he's worried that Brooklyn's schools aren't going to give him a good enough education. \"The system is broken; we can't get the superior education that they supposedly want to give us,\" he says. Through the centuries America's immigrants have endured terrible hardship and sacrifice so that they and their children can get ahead. Perhaps it's not surprising to hear the members of the Bushwick youth group lament the multiple, low paid jobs that their parents must do simply to get the rent paid and put food on the table. What is startling is that these bright, ambitious youngsters just don't believe that talent and hard work are enough to ensure they will ever have a shot at that mythical American Dream.

How the Belarskys came to be in America is an extraordinary tale that Isabel loves to tell. It was the offer of a six-month job by a Mormon college president, who had seen Sidor singing in Leningrad, that enabled the Belarskys to escape from Stalin's Russia in 1930. \"Our dream was being in America,\" Isabel says. \"They loved it. My mother could never think of Russia, it was her enemy and my father, he made such a wonderful career here.\" Like generations of immigrants before them, the Belarskys came to America in search of freedom--to them the American Dream meant liberty. But Isabel says it promised even more. \"The dream is to work, to have a home and to get ahead. You can start as a janitor and become the owner of the building.\" The American Dream is not written into the constitution but it is so ingrained in the national psyche that it might as well be. Many point to the second sentence in the Declaration of Independence--the \"certain unalienable rights\" that include \"life, liberty and the pursuit of happiness\" as the \"official\" version of the phrase. But it was actually in 1931 that the term was popularized, when historian James Truslow Adams wrote in The Epic of America that the Dream means \"a better, richer, and happier life for all our citizens of every rank\". The concept of the American Dream has not stayed static. For European immigrants, like Isabel, fleeing persecution in the first half of the last century, the Dream was about a life without persecution.  But somewhere in the middle of the last century the dream changed. As America's post war economy boomed, the new arrivals wanted more than freedom--they wanted a share of the prosperity as well.  In the 1950s, TV commercials featured housewives proudly showing off kitchens filled with gleaming appliances. The quest for liberation became a quest for Coca Cola. As the century wore on, the materialistic slant of the dream overtook the political side. Dallas and Dynasty suggested this was a country where it was possible to become not just rich, but filthily rich. Cheyanne Smith was shocked at the deprivation that greeted her in America. She arrived in New York from the Caribbean seven years ago. Having watched endless American TV shows as a child, she thought she knew what to expect when her family moved to Brooklyn. Instead, the deprivation of one of New York's poorest neighbourhoods shocked her. \"I thought this is not America because this is not what I see on television,\" she says. Like Cheyanne, 18-year-old Franscisco Curiel is also ambitious. He came from Mexico City three years ago to go to college here but he's worried that Brooklyn's schools aren't going to give him a good enough education. \"The system is broken; we can't get the superior education that they supposedly want to give us,\" he says. Through the centuries America's immigrants have endured terrible hardship and sacrifice so that they and their children can get ahead. Perhaps it's not surprising to hear the members of the Bushwick youth group lament the multiple, low paid jobs that their parents must do simply to get the rent paid and put food on the table. What is startling is that these bright, ambitious youngsters just don't believe that talent and hard work are enough to ensure they will ever have a shot at that mythical American Dream.

Given the emphasis on improving safety, it's possible that well-known phrases such as \"live fast and die young\" may lose their meaning as innovative   new devices are built into cars and trucks and other things that go. Many of the new safety systems that are being added to high-end vehicles are computer-assisted technologies that transfer some of the vehicle's operations to the vehicle itself, rather than relying only on the driver's decision-making skills.   For example, predictive brake assist is an in-vehicle feature that prepares the vehicle for braking when its built-in sensors detect a potential object ahead. The predictive brake assist basically places the vehicle's braking system on alert, which helps the system to slow down the car in as little time and as short a distance as possible. Other in-vehicle sensors will detect moving and still objects and will even distinguish the objects based on simple patterns, such as other vehicles vs. a person.

These systems compute the   movement of the objects and detect possible dangerous intersections  . What technological developments have enabled innovations like predictive precollision systems? Essentially, these so-called active systems are the result of vehicle-to-vehicle and vehicle-to-infrastructure communications.

You might want something someone else has, or feel like they're happier than you. It might seem like an uncontrollable emotion, but it's truly not! Remember your big accomplishments. If your coworker gets the promotion you wanted, it doesn't mean you haven't done great work. List out your accomplishments and think about how you got them and what you've done since then. You'll quickly find that you're just as worthy as the person you're envying! Appreciate your own good fortune. Think of where you are in your life and how you got there. Did you just buy your first car? Are you able to save one paycheck each month? Are you surrounded by loving family and amazing friends? You have a lot of good things,and you have a lot of good fortune coming your way. Stop letting jealousy eat you alive and realize that you can better spend that energy on furthering your own success and happiness. Appreciate that others can do what you can't. How boring would life be if everyone was the same? What if the entire population of your city was applying for your job, and they all had the same qualifications? Appreciate that everyone is different. Some people are better in powerful management positions, while maybe you're better working with people.

This event, which took place on June 5-6, tested robots on how well they could respond during a disaster and the winning team finally took home a $2 million grand prize. The DARPA challenge was created after the 2011 Fukushima nuclear disaster in Japan. An earthquake caused a tsunami, which damaged a nuclear power plant. Workers at the plant needed to shut off an important valve , but it was too dangerous for humans to reach it. The US scientists at DARPA wondered whether the disaster could have been avoided if a robot had been sent to do _ . So they set up the robotics competition. Turning a valve was just one task a robot might have to perform when entering a disaster zone. In addition to doing this, robots participating in the challenge had to navigate a course containing several other tasks: driving and exiting a vehicle, opening a door, walking over or clearing objects, cutting a hole in a wall, plus climbing a flight of stairs. Teams had to complete the challenge in one hour, and points were awarded based on how quickly the robots completed a task. They didn't have to attempt all the tasks. To make things even more realistic, challenge organizers caused short computer-system blackouts  that prevented robots and the human operators controlling them from communicating.

Now a new study removes a common belief why they quit. It's much more basic than flunking out . Society tends to think of high school dropouts as kids who just can't cut it. They are lazy, and perhaps not too bright. So researchers were surprised when they asked more than 450 kids who quit school about why they left. \"The vast majority actually had passing grades and they were confident that they could have graduated from high school.\" John Bridgeland, the executive researcher said. About one million teens leave school each year. Only about half of African-American and Hispanic students will receive a diploma , and actually all dropouts come to regret their decision. So, if failing grades don't explain why these kids quit, what does? Again, John Bridgeland: \"The most dependable finding was that they were bored.\" \"They found classes uninteresting; they weren't inspired or motivated. They didn't see any direct connection between what they were learning in the classroom to their own lives, or to their career aspirations.\" The study found that most teens who do drop out wait until they turn sixteen, which happens to be the age at which most states allow students to quit. In the U.S., only one state, New Mexico, has a law requiring teenagers to stay in high school until they graduate. Only four states: California, Tennessee, Texas and Utah, plus the District of Columbia, require school attendance until age 18, no exceptions. Jeffrey Grin, another researcher, says raising the compulsory attendance age may be one way to keep more kids in school. \"As these dropouts look back, they realize they've made a mistake. And anything that sort of gives these people an extra push to stick it out and see it through to the end, is probably helpful measure.\" New Hampshire may be the next state to raise its school attendance age to 18. But critics say that forcing the students unwilling to continue their studies to stay in school misses the point--the need for reform. It's been called for to reinvent high school education to make it more challenging and relevant, and to ensure that kids who do stick it out receive a diploma that actually means something.

{"answer": 3, "choices": ["the grades of most dropouts at school were acceptable", "dropouts' salary is not as satisfying as graduates'", "classes don't appeal to dropouts", "about 500,000 high school dropouts are black and Spanish"], "question": "A survey suggests that people who have dropped out from high school just earn an average of $9,000 less per year than graduates. Now a new study removes a common belief why they quit. It's much more basic than flunking out . Society tends to think of high school dropouts as kids who just can't cut it. They are lazy, and perhaps not too bright. So researchers were surprised when they asked more than 450 kids who quit school about why they left. \"The vast majority actually had passing grades and they were confident that they could have graduated from high school.\" John Bridgeland, the executive researcher said. About one million teens leave school each year. Only about half of African-American and Hispanic students will receive a diploma , and actually all dropouts come to regret their decision. So, if failing grades don't explain why these kids quit, what does? Again, John Bridgeland: \"The most dependable finding was that they were bored.\" \"They found classes uninteresting; they weren't inspired or motivated. They didn't see any direct connection between what they were learning in the classroom to their own lives, or to their career aspirations.\" The study found that most teens who do drop out wait until they turn sixteen, which happens to be the age at which most states allow students to quit.

The findings are based on a survey in 32 elementary schools of two German cities, Dortmund and Essen. The researchers, led by Rebecca Muckelbauer, a nutritionist  at the Research Institute of Child Nutrition Dortmund, weighed about 3,000 children, and asked them about their beverage consumption . At the beginning of the school year, the experts had water fountains added to 17 of the schools. The scientists also worked with teachers to carry out educational programs that promote the benefits of drinking water. In contrast to schools in the United States, there are very few schools in Germany that have water fountains. At the beginning of the study, there were no big differences in the number of overweight children in the different groups. But by the end of the school year, children in the schools with water fountains were 31 per cent less likely to gain extra pounds, compared to kids who went to other schools, where water drinking was not encouraged. Children in the schools with fountains increased their water consumption from about 3 up to 4 glasses a day, while those in the other schools continued to drink an average of 3 glasses. Over the research, the number of overweight kids upped from 384 to 385 out of 1,641 at the schools with water fountains.

In a city with trillions of American cockroaches , the Houston Museum of Natural Science has agreed to pay a quarter per bug-up to 1,000-as it seeks to populate a new insect exhibit alongside its Cockrell Butterfly Center. Nancy Greig, the museum's director insists the public payday for roaches isn't just a marketing ploy . \"Absolutely, this wasn't devised as a joke,\" Greig said. \"We needed more roaches for the exhibit, so I sent this message out to everyone in the museum asking people to bring them in. Well, someone decided to tell the press, and all hell has broken loose.\" \"But we really do need cockroaches.\" \"One might be forgiven for never considering how to catch a live cockroach. But it's simple enough to fool them,\" Greig said, \"and even easier to catch them.\" American cockroaches are the most common kind in Texas, measuring up to 2 inches long and invading homes. Despite their less-than-attractive reputation, cockroaches actually aren't that dirty. Greig even went so far as to call them \"fastidious\" saying they don't enjoy rooting  in waste. They're only dirty if, say, they used a sewer line to gain access into a home. The roaches collected by the museum will become part of a display in a new exhibit that showcases insects such as cockroaches, dung beetles and termites. There's more to like about roaches, too.

Bangkok  In general, the more westernized the place is, the more likely you will be expected to leave a tip.Some top-end restaurants will add a 10% service charge to the bill.If not, waiters will appreciate your tacking on the 10% yourself.However, if you're eating at a lower-end restaurant, a tip is not necessary.If you're staying at one of Bangkok's many five-star hotels, expect to tip the porter 20 to 50 baht ,depending on how many bags you have.Taxis are now metered in Bangkok.Local custom is to round up the fare to the nearest five baht. Hong Kong Tipping is customary in this money-mad metropolis .Most restaurants add a 10% service charge to the bill, but the extra money often ends up in the pocket of the owner. If the service is good, add another 10% to the bill, up to HKMYMl00 in an especially nice restaurant.For HK MYM10 hotel porters should do it at all but the nicest hotels where a new HKMYM20 bill may be more acceptable.When in a taxi, round up to the nearest dollar. Kuala Lumpur  Tipping in Malaysia is limited to the expensive westernized hotels, which often add a 10% service charge to your meal or hotel room.If you are at a hotel restaurant, expect a 10% service charge.

There appears a new housing platform which can detect the stress on electricity -- and the stress on the heart. \"There is a growing population of elderly people, and there are statistics to show that more and more of them are going to live alone in the home,\" said Johann Siau, a senior lecturer at the University of Hertfordshire in the U.K., who was leading the InterHome project.

An appropriate tip is between 15 and 20 percent of the amount charged for the service (But the charge for the tip doesn't appear on the bill. The customer is expected to add it himself/herself.) Tipping less than this sends a message to your waiters that you think they've done a bad job serving you. And to leave no tip at all is simply unacceptable. It's not that American waiters are greedy. In many countries, waiters are paid a salary for their work. They'll earn money even if no one comes into the restaurant. This system offers much more safety for waiters than the American version. In the US, waiters know that a night without customers means a night without pay. Some countries include a tip for waiters - a \"service charge\" - on the bill itself. Since the tip is included with the other charges, waiters don't need to worry about people forgetting to tip. But in the US, waiters do not receive a salary, and service charges only appear on bills when there are six or more customers at the table. Since almost all American customers are familiar with the system, they know to add a tip without being told. But visitors to the US may expect waiters to be paid a salary, or think that the tip is included on the bill. So much as we waiters loved hearing stories about other places from our foreign customers, we were always nervous when they got ready to leave the restaurant. We were never sure what to expect.

Last week, a study was released about a new treatment that combines 5 medicines for heart disease in one pill. Salim Yusuf of McMaster University in Hamilton, Ontario, Canada was the lead investigator. He presented the findings at the American College of Cardiology Conference in Orlando, Florida. The experimental drug is known as Polycap. It contains aspirin, a drug to lower cholesterol  and three medicines to lower blood pressure. The study was carried out at 50 health centers across India. More than two thousand people between the ages of 45 and 80 took part in the study. All had at least one risk factor for heart disease. These include high blood pressure, high cholesterol, diabetes or being severely overweight. The people were divided into 9 groups of about 200 people each. One group took Polycap. The other groups took either a single drug or different combinations of the medicines in the Polycap pill. The study showed that Polycap lowered blood pressure and cholesterol without many side effects. Doctor Yusuf said the single pill, taken once a day, could reduce the average person's risk of heart disease and stroke by about half. The maker of Polycap, Cadila Pharmaceuticals of India, paid for the study. Cardiovascular diseases  of the heart and blood vessels are the number one cause of death around the world. These diseases kill more than seventeen million people every year. 80 percent of them are in low and middle income countries. Doctor Yusuf said the single pill treatment could revolutionize heart disease prevention. People would be more likely to take one pill a day than many pills.

I volunteered  about 30 to 40 hours a week during the summer. Most of the time I spent there was with Mr. Gillespie. He never had any visitors, and nobody seemed to care about his condition. I spent many days there holding his hand and talking to him, helping with anything that needed to be done. He became a close friend of mine, even though he responded with only an occasional squeeze   of my hand. Mr. Gillespie was in a coma  . I left for a week for a vacation with my parents, and when I came back, Mr. Gillespie was gone. I didn't have the courage to ask any of the nurses where he was, for fear they might tell me he had died. So with many questions unanswered, I continued to volunteer there through my eighth-grade year. Several years later, when I was a junior in high school, I was at the gas station when I noticed a familiar face. When I realized who it was, my eyes filled with tears. He was alive!

This is the first campaign of this kind in the UN. We want to try to involve as many men and boys as possible to be advocates for change. I started questioning gender-based assumption a long time ago. When I was 8, I was confused being called bossy because I wanted to direct a play that we put on for our parents, but the boys were not. When I was 14, I started to be sexualized by certain elements of the media. At 15, my girlfriends started dropping out of a lot of sports teams because they didn't want to appear masculine. At 18, my male friends were unable to express their feelings. I decided that I was a feminist. This seemed uncomplicated to me. But my recent research has shown me that feminism has become an unpopular word. Women are choosing not to identify as feminists. Why has the word become such an uncomfortable one? I'm from Britain and I think it is right that I am paid the same as my male counterparts. I think it is right that I should make decisions about my own body. I think it is right that women be involved on my behalf in the policies and decisions that will affect my life. I think it is right that socially, I am afforded the same respect as men. But sadly, I can say that there is no one country in the world where all women can expect to receive these rights. No country in the world can yet say that they have achieved gender equality. These rights, I considered to be human rights, but I am one of the lucky ones. My life is a sheer privilege because my parents didn't love me less because I was born a daughter. My school did not limit me because I was a girl. My mentors didn't assume that I would end up nowhere because I might give birth to a child one day. These influences were the gender equality ambassadors that made me who I am today. They may not know it but they are the inadvertent feminists who are changing the world today. We need more of those.

A true friendship carries a long history of experience that determines who we are and keeps us connected. It is a treasure we should protect. Unfortunately, the better friends you are, the more probably you'll have disagreements. And the result can be what you don't want--an end to the relationship. The good news is that most troubled friendships can be mended. First, don't let your pride get in your way. Most of us can forgive each other when differences are brought out in the open. Second, apologize when you're wrong -- even if you've been wronged. Over the course of a friendship, even the best people make mistakes. Sometimes, it may be best if the _ takes the lead and apologizes. When you apologize, give your friend a chance to admit  that he has been wrong. Third, see things from your friend's point of view.

But there are slight differences between British and American English in vocabulary, pronunciation, spelling and grammar. The first difference between British and American English is in vocabulary. Almost all of the words used in British English and American English are exactly the same. Only a very small number of words are used _ . For example, Americans would say \"apartment\", but the British would say \"flat\" to talk about the place where they live. In addition to some common words, many idiomatic expressions are different. In England people might say \"I'll ring you up tonight\", but in the US, people might say \"I'll call you up tonight\". The second difference between British and American English is in Pronunciation. The main difference in pronunciation concerns the vowels . Some American dialects and some British dialects use vowels in different ways. Sometimes, Americans and the British don't understand each other's pronunciation. But most of the time, the British and Americans do understand each other's pronunciation because most of the sounds of the two dialects are the same. The third difference is very small. This is the difference in spelling. A few types of words are spelled differently in British and American English. The most common example is in a word like \"center\". In British English, this word would be spelled C-E-N-T-R-E, while in American English the same word would be spelled C-E-N-T-E-R. Another example is \"or\" vs \"our\". The word \"color\"is spelled C-O-L-O-U-R in Britain but C-O-L-O-R in the US. There are a few differences in grammar, too. The British may say \"Have you got..?\" while Americans prefer \"Do you have..?\" An American might say \"my friend just arrived\", but a British would say \"my friend has just arrived\".

Today's young people will be affected by potential   killers such as heart disease because of their weight. Fatty fast-food diets combined with the lifestyles with televisions and computers could mean kids will die young, says Professor Andrew Prentice, from the London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine. At the same time, the shape of the human body is going through a great change because adults are getting so fat. Here in Britain, the latest research shows that the average waist size for a man is 36~38 inches and may be 42~44 inches by 2032.This compares with only 32.6 inches in 1972. Women's waists have grown from an average of 22 inches in the 1920s to 24 inches in the 1950s and 30 inches now. One of the major reasons why children now are at greater risk is that we are getting fatter younger. In the UK alone, more than one million under 16 years old are thought to be overweight or fat--double the number in the 1980s. One in ten of four-year-olds are also medically said to be obese. The obesity which started in the US, has now spread to Europe, Australia, Central America and the Middle East. Many nations now record more than 20 percent of their population as obese and well over half of the population as overweight. Professor Prentice says the change in our shape has been caused by high-energy foods combined with a dramatic   drop in the energy we use as a result of technology developments. He is not alone in his concern. Only last week one medical magazine revealed how obesity was fuelling a rise in cancer cases. Obesity also increases the risk factor for heart disease and so on. An averagely obese person's lifespan   is shortened by around nine years while a seriously obese person by much more. Professor Prentice says, \"So _ will _ parents _ live _ longer _ than _ their _ children, _ as _ an _ American _ obesity _ expert _ said _ recently?\" \"The answer is yes--and no.\" Yes, when most children become obese. No, because this is now becoming an alarmingly serious problem in the US. \"Such children will have a greatly reduced quality of life on both body and mind.\" So say \"No\" to sandwiches and hamburgers.

Donna put in a greater effort in her search. She remembered seeing a poster by the same company in the city so she drove all the way down and made a few rounds to search for it.

When an animal is under attack, it can run away or fight back. Plants certainly cannot run away, and they lack teeth and claws. But plants can defend   themselves by using both physical and chemical means. Some plants have their own ways to keep animals away. For example, the leaves of the holly plant have sharp spines   that discourage grass-eating animals. Holly leaves on lower branches have more spines than leaves on upper branches. This is because the lower leaves are easier for most animals to reach. Some plants, such as the oak tree, have thick and hard leaves that are difficult for animals to eat. Some grasses may contain a sandy material; eating such grasses wears down the animal's teeth. Many plants also have chemical defenses. Some plants produce chemicals that taste bitter or cause an unpleasant reaction. Some plants may fight against an attack by increasing the production of these chemicals. When a caterpillar   bites a tobacco leaf, the leaf produces a chemical messenger. This messenger sends to the roots the information to produce more nicotine.

But its wonders sounded so incredible that they were forever burned in his memory. From that moment, he never stopped searching for clues which might lead him to the island. He read hundreds of adventure books, histories, volumes of physics and chemistry, even music. Over time, he pieced together his idea of what the Island of Inventions was like. It was a secret place, where all the great wise men of the world would meet to learn and invent together. Access to the island was totally restricted. To join, you had to have created some great invention for humanity. Only then could you receive the special invitation -- which came with directions to the island. So Luca spent his youth studying and inventing. Every new idea he got, he made it into an invention, and if there were something he didn't understand, he'd seek others to help him. Soon he met other young inventors and he told them about the Island of Inventions. They too dreamed of one day receiving an invitation letter. As years passed, the disappointment of not receiving their invitation made Luca and his friends work harder and co-operate more. They would meet in Luca's house, share their ideas and build new machines. Their inventions became known throughout the world, and improved the lives of millions. But still, no invitation came. They didn't lose heart. They continued learning and inventing every day, trying to come up with more and better ideas. Fresh young talent joined their group, as more inventors dreamed of getting to the island. One day many years later, Luca, already very old, was speaking with a brilliant young man named Roberts, who had written to him, asking him to join the group.

In a recently published paper, researchers concluded that expressions of fear and disgust changed the way human eyes gather and focus light. They argued that these changes were the result of evolutionary development and were intended to help humans survive, or at least discover, very different dangers. In order to test their hypothesis  ,researchers examined two dozen volunteer college students with standard eye-exam equipment, and asked them to show expressions of fear and dislike. It was found that when the students widened their eyes, more light was admitted and their field of vision was expanded. When they wrinkled their noses in disgust, their eyes narrowed. This had the effect of blocking out more light but focusing on a specific point. Although some scientists have admitted that emotional expressions are intended primarily to communicate information, expressions of fear and disgust seem to perform different visual functions. \"Eye widening may help to find a potential danger that requires much attention.

That is why we can use it to identify someone. There is no doubt that DNA evidence is becoming a very powerful tool for law enforcement  officers. In the US, all 50 states and the federal government keep DNA databases of some criminals after they have been convicted . Whenever a crime happens, the police collect DNA from the crime scene and compare this with samples they already have in the criminal database. If they match any suspect in the database, then they've caught their criminal. Even if they don't, the DNA sample can still be used to determine the person's sex, height, hair and eye color1 and other characteristics. This helps police to create a physical profile of the criminal. Some people feel that the database should be made bigger to contain everyone's DNA and help to solve many more crimes. This would also avoid mistakes when someone is wrongly convicted of a crime. DNA doesn't make mistakes. However, other people are worried that it would violate their privacy. Someone's DNA can be used to gather information such as the person's family and ethnic  background, whether he or she has a gene mutation or certain genetic diseases, and other personal issues.

It was Christmas and his only friend Jacob Marley, had been dead for seven years. What was there for him to celebrate? He listened with growing anger to the people calling out greetings in the street and _ his nephew Bob Cratchit, who was just ready to go home. \"Merry Christmas, uncle,\" called Bob as he hurried out of the door. Scrooge sighed. He might just as well go to bed. Aware that he should not waste his candle, he quickly undressed and climbed into bed. But no sooner had he done so than the ghost of Marley, covered in chains, appeared. \"What's the matter, Jacob?\" he asked. \"There are the chains I made in my life,\" answered the ghost. \"I'm forced to wander around with no rest and no peace. I have come here to warn you that if you do not change, this too will be your fate. You will be visited by three spirits. Expect the first one tomorrow when the clock strikes one. Expect the second and the third on the following nights at the same hour.\" With that Marley vanished. \"Nonsense!\" he said and going back to bed, fell fast asleep. When Scrooge awoke it was dark. The clock struck one. At the sound, light flashed into the room and there stood a young boy. \"Who are you?\" asked Scrooge in an unsteady voice. \"I'm the spirit of Christmas past,\" replied the spirit. \"Come with me.\" \"Do you remember this?\" he asked. Scrooge did. He heard the happy cries of people, and looking around he found himself, as he used to be, sitting on a chair and reading. It was a Christmas. Suddenly Scrooge watched his younger self joined in a band, dancing and laughing. \"Strange,\" said the spirit, \"that such little things should make people so happy.\" The ghost let him go and Scrooge sank down into a deep sleep. When he awoke again the second night, the clock sounded one again. Before he doubted the second spirit already turned up.

His surprise increased when the door opened and in came Bob carrying a small, sick boy, Tiny Tim. \"Sit down,\" cried Bob to his family. \"Let's have the best Christmas dinner!\" They all began to eat eagerly. Scrooge watched at the happiness and contentment of his poor nephew's family. \"A Merry Christmas to us all!\" cried Bob. \"God bless us everyone!\" added Tiny Tim, who sat very close to his father and Bob held his thin hand tightly. \"No, not for the uncle, but for you and the children.

Soon he was designing buildings that were beautiful.     He also wanted to make his buildings fit into the land around them. One of the houses he designed is on top of a high hill. Other people built tall, square houses on hills, but Wright did not want to lose the beauty of the hill. He built the house low and wide.     Now other architects know how to design buildings to fit into the land. Frank Lloyd Wright showed them how to do it. Which of the following statements is not true?", "subject": ""}

Well, the Big Day eventually did arrive; only it was different than expected. My wife, always more accepting changes than I am, finally talked me into clearing out the entire mess. The pain I experienced was also unexpected. What hurt me was to come across those terrible papers I'd written, which reminded me of my poor study habits, and an embarrassing lack of comprehension. It was great to get rid of them. But it was also a clearing of personal history. At first, I struggled with this. The truth was in the record that my books, my notes, and my papers were primary source materials, documenting an important time in my life. To clear them out was to clear out the truth. What I've learned since taking this leap is that the process is more important than the truth. I feel as if much of my real education during my college years isn't in the documents but now in me. So I am glad to free myself of this physical burden. And what's better is that I don't need to look back to those painful moments. They belong to the past.

Believing this will cause us to ignore the real problem and risk long-term damage to our planet. Let me start by explaining why overpopulation is a _ . For one thing, the UN Population Division regularly predicts population growth but provides a low variant   , medium variant, and high variant to factor in various possibilities. In the 2010 revision, their high variant suggests that the world population will be almost 16 billion in 2100, but the low variant predicts it will peak at 8 billion and decrease to just over 6 billion by 2100. In most cases, it is the low variant that has come true in the past, suggesting the same will be true of their future population predictions. In addition to this, the size of families is actually decreasing. For another, if the Earth is overpopulated, there needs to be insufficient   food, water, and space for humans to live. However, Indian economist Raj Krishna estimates that India alone is able to increase crop produce to the point of providing the entire world's food supply. The World Food Programme confirms that there is sufficient food grown to feed the world and there is the same amount of fresh water on the planet now as there was 10,000 years ago. So how is it possible that the number of people in the world is affecting our planet? Therefore, it is not an increase in population but an increase in consumption that is a severe threat. Materialism and overconsumption are facts of life for everybody in the western world, as possessions reflect a person's status in society and people strive to obtain happiness through owning the latest fashionable goods. Not only that, but waste is a common occurrence which has a huge effect on our resources. It is a sad truth that 80% of the world's resources are currently used by just 20% of the world's population. Our overconsumption must be addressed now to make our lives more sustainable   and avoid continuing the terrible damage to the environment we are causing. The key is education.

Violently jetting hoses mess up the soil structure and may expose delicate roots. Use a rose on a can. Aim low - don't waste water wetting leaves, even though they look pretty and \"refreshed\".  The most valuable and easily damaged plants need the most attention, such as newly planted trees, bushes and climbers. Remove any water-keeping mulch you may have put around the base, then water it thoroughly at least two gallons, slowly. Don't aim your can rose at the stem - which we all usually tend to do. Aim the water in a wide circle so that the whole of the area under the plant is watered. You could even make a channel in the soil right around the plant so that the water is held in place as it soaks in. Replace the mulch. Repeat each week even in showery weather for the first summer.  How much water for pots? Fill up the gap between the top of the soil and the top of the pot. Let the water soak right in and then fill it again. Do this daily in hot weather for most summer potted plants.  Stand pots in saucers - it makes a big difference. But remember to check that the plants are not sitting in water for days on end when the weather turns wet. Roots will rot.  If the fertilizer in pots really dries out, the water may get straight out of the pot without being absorbed.

Violently jetting hoses mess up the soil structure and may expose delicate roots. Use a rose on a can. Aim low - don't waste water wetting leaves, even though they look pretty and \"refreshed\".  The most valuable and easily damaged plants need the most attention, such as newly planted trees, bushes and climbers. Remove any water-keeping mulch you may have put around the base, then water it thoroughly at least two gallons, slowly. Don't aim your can rose at the stem - which we all usually tend to do. Aim the water in a wide circle so that the whole of the area under the plant is watered. You could even make a channel in the soil right around the plant so that the water is held in place as it soaks in. Replace the mulch. Repeat each week even in showery weather for the first summer.  How much water for pots? Fill up the gap between the top of the soil and the top of the pot. Let the water soak right in and then fill it again. Do this daily in hot weather for most summer potted plants.  Stand pots in saucers - it makes a big difference. But remember to check that the plants are not sitting in water for days on end when the weather turns wet. Roots will rot.  If the fertilizer in pots really dries out, the water may get straight out of the pot without being absorbed. Correct this by standing or floating the pot in a bucket of deep water until it sinks and no bubbles rise.  A push-button watering can makes for more efficient watering, and recycled water bottles upside down with a needle which has a hole on the end are useful, too, for pots.

By the end of September, about 80 per cent of industrial pollutants met required standards and the lake is expected to be cleaner by the end of the year, officials said.  According to targets set by the State Environmental Protection Administration, all polluting enterprises must meet set standards by the end of this year or they will be shut down. The Taihu Lake area, which surrounds the cities of Suzhou, Wuxiand Changshou, is one of the most economically developed areas in the country and has long enjoyed a reputation as the \"land of fish and rice\" However, the quality of water in the lake has been deteriorating at an alarmingly rate in recent years, which has caused concern from the government and local people.

{"answer": 1, "choices": ["marvelous", "awkward", "flexible", "awesome"], "question": "The end of the World Cup does not mean the end of international competition, in Brazil this year. A major football event will happen in the South American country later this month, but with teams of robots playing the game, which is known as soccer in the United States. The robot teams are guided by teams of humans from around the world. The event is known as RoboCup. Technology students at the University of Pennsylvania are trying for their fourth victory at the competition, which is held this year in the coastal city Joao Pessoa. The students have won the last three RoboCup competitions. Watching robots play football is similar to watching children play the game. The kicks are not good, there's a lot of falling down, and people are there to guide and support the team members. Jian Qiao Li is one of the leaders of the University of Pennsylvania team. He says one goal he has for the robot team is to make sure the machines can find the goal and the ball. He also wants the robots to be able to know where they are on the playing field. And he wants the team to be able to better control the walking and kicking abilities of the robots. Qin He is another leader of the robot team. She says the abilities of the robots increase every year. Ms. He says the US team is meeting its goals. The robots know the differences between the colors green and red, and they can decide where to go and where the ball is on the playing field. She says if there are three robot players on the field at the same time, they will communicate with each other to decide the different responsibilities for each robot. U. S. Team member Christopher Akatusuka hopes for another victory in Brazil. The team has won the RoboCup the past three years in the Netherlands, Mexico and Turkey. \"They have every good team player right now. As long as their detection is good, I think they'll be very competitive; we just hope to compete against the real good German teams eventually, because the Germans always do very well, \" says Akatsuka. Mr Akatsuka says RoboCup is an exciting technology competition. \"Each team develops their own software; basically it's a competition of who has the best software, who has the best decision--making at a given point... it's really exciting, \" says Akatsuka. The event begins July 19th and ends July 25th. Some RoboCup participants hope to develop a team of robots that can play against humans by 2050.

The trouble with keeping up with the new English is not so much that there are so many new words but that the old words no longer mean what we thought they did.In the past, if someone said they did not have Windows,you would have to suppose they lived in a cave.These days, it is probably because they use a Mac(which is a computer,not a rain coat).Spam is as disliked as it ever was,but whereas it once meant an unappetizing canned meat.It now stands for unwanted 'junk\" email.Spellings are changing,too.Not only is text-messaging playing \"hvc with vrbs\" (havoc with verbs),but the conventions of email communication place little emphasis on \"perfect speaking\".     Weblish loves to see nouns happily become verbs (\"please bookmark this site\"),and verbs become nouns (\"Send me the download\").Verbs and prepositions are regularly thrown together to become new nouns or adjectives(dial--up,logon,print-on,pull--down,upload),while others are created from simply pairing nouns:cyberspace,emit Internet,hyperlink,metatag,netspeak.

{"answer": 3, "choices": ["time saving", "attentiveness", "credibility", "profitability"], "question": "Publicity  offers several benefits. There are no costs for message time or space. An ad in prime-time television may cost $250,000 to $5,000,000 or more per minute, whereas a five-minute report on a network newscast would not cost anything. Publicity reaches a mass audience within a short time and new products or company policies are widely known. Credibility about messages is high, because they are reported in independent media. A newspaper review of a movie has more believability than an ad in the same paper, because the reader associates independence with objectivity. Similarly, people are more likely to pay attention to news reports than to ads. For example, Women's Wear Daily has both fashion reports and advertisements. Readers spend time reading the stories, but they skim through the ads. Furthermore, there may be 10 commercials during a half-hour television program or hundreds of ads in a magazine. Feature stories are much fewer in number and stand out clearly. Publicity also has some significant limitations. A firm has little control over messages, their timing, their placement, or their coverage by a given medium. It may issue detailed news releases and find only portions mentioned by the media, and media have the ability to be much more critical than a firm would like. For example, in 1982, Procter & Gamble faced a massive publicity problem over the meaning of its 123-year-old company logo. To fight this negative publicity, the firm had a spokesperson appear on Good Morning America to disprove the rumor  . The false rumors were temporarily put to rest.

Scientists have genetically modified a cat as part of an experiment that could lead to treatments for diseases. Named Mr. Green Genes, he looks like a sixmonthold cat but, under ultraviolet  light, his eyes, gums and tongue glow green. That is the result of a genetic experiment at the Audubon Center for Research of Endangered Species in New Orleans, US. Mr. Green Genes is the first fluorescent  cat in the US and probably the world, said Betsy Dresser, the center's director. The researchers made him so they could learn whether a gene could be introduced harmlessly into a cat's genetic sequence. If so, it would be the first step in a process that could lead to the development of ways to treat diseases via gene therapy. The gene, which was added to Mr. Green Genes'DNA, has no effect on his health, Ms Dresser said.  Cats are ideal for this project because their genetic makeup is similar to that of humans, said Dr Martha Gomez, a scientist at the center.

Being punctual is also very important in the USA. In the UK, it's important to be punctual for business meetings, but nobody expects you to be on time for a social event. Half past seven really means a quarter to eight, or even eight o'clock! With Russians, you should always be on time, though it is not unusual for them to be one or even two hours late! It is best to dress formally and wear dark colours when you meet people from all the four countries. In Russia, designer clothes are very common. Don't be surprised if you go to an office in the UK on a Friday and find everyone wearing jeans. Many companies have \"dress down Friday\", when people wear casual   clothes. In Germany, first names are only used by family members and close friends, so be prepared to use titles and last names. In the USA you will usually be invited to use first names almost immediately. The British are quite informal and using first names in business is more and more common, especially among younger people. In Russia, however, nobody uses first names, so use titles and last names. In conversation, the British and the Americans value humour, and both like to talk about sport. The weather is also a good topic of conversation with the British and the Americans, but avoid talking about politics. In Russia, say positive things about their country, but avoid making complaints.

With all those hormones  flooding their bodies, they can be moody, unpredictable, and tend to make uncertain choices. But however confusing their teenage years are, kids can still be generally happy, depending on their lifestyle choices. According to a new research by British scientists, teens who don't smoke, drink only moderately or not at all, and who don't eat much junk food are likely to be happier than other teens. The study looked at 40,000 British families and came up with some interesting findings. For example, kids who never drank alcohol were up to six times more likely to report higher levels of happiness than kids who drank. And teens who smoked were five times less likely to rate high on happiness charts compared to kids who don't smoke. Same goes for diet and physical activity. The more fruits and vegetables kids eat, and the more hours they spend playing sports, the happier they are. Now, of course this doesn't mean that not smoking or drinking, and playing sports guarantees happiness. It could be that kids who have happy character tend to be more active and less addicted to drinking or smoking. And it could equally be the case that kids who are unhappy are more related to drinking and smoking and eating junk food.

Nothing shakes a parent's confidence as much as the starting of a child's adolescence. The communication that has flowed easily through words, glance and touch becomes a minefield  Recent discoveries that the human brain undergoes specific and dramatic development during adolescence offer new \"explanations\" of teen behavior, particularly of the impulsiveness  of teenagers. During this development, there may be too many synapses  for the brain to work efficiently, the mental capacities of decision-making, judgment and control are not mature until the age of twenty-four. An old explanation is that anger hormones account for the apparently unreasonable moodiness  of teens. Though hormones do play a role in human feelings, the real task of adolescence, and the real cause of the unrest, is the uncertainty of teenagers about who they are, alongside their eagerness to establish a sense of identity. This involves self-questioning, self-discovery and self-development across a range of issues, including sex, faith, intellect and relationships. A sense of who we are is not a mere luxury; without it we feel worthless. A teen often looks upon his or her friends sa models: \" I don't know who I am, but I know who he is, I'll be like him,\" is the underlying thought.

While those common teenager-parent quarrels, which explode every few days, are often over small things such as homework, housework, and respect; a teenager's real focus is on a parent's recognition of his maturity and capability and human value. \" No, you can't go out tonight,\" implies that a parent you got your keys?\" or \"Do you have enough money for the bus?\" are questions that can be easily accepted if asked by a concerned friend, but awaken a teen's own doubts if asked by a parent. Feeling the need to distinguish himself from the kid who can't remember to take his lunch, his keys or his money, he blames the parent for reminding him of the child-self still living within him.

One is silver, and the other gold. This song expresses a nice rule: increasing friends. Sometimes things actually work out that way. I've met adults who've said, \"We've been friends since kindergarten!\" A friend who has known you forever is a treasure. But friendships don't always last -- especially for children. When I was growing up, my family moved about every three years. The advantage of this was that I got to see different parts of the world, and it made my family very close. I also learned to be pretty good at making new friends, and, to keep in touch with old friends, I became a great letter writer. But I always admired those kids who stayed in one place and kept their friends for a long time. I didn't learn that children's friendships can disappear even when no one moves until I was much older, with children of my own. Sometimes friendships end in quarrels and hurt feelings.

Between attending college classes at Indiana University-Purdue University Indianapolis (IUPUI) and tutoring his fellow students, Jake is also working on a new theory about the creation of the universe. He happens to be 12 years old. From an early age, Jake showed an extraordinary interest in stars. When he was 3, his parents took him to a space observatory. He tried to learn as much as he could about astronomy. Jake's IQ measured remarkably high at 170. As a baby, Jake was found out with Asperser's syndrome, a form of autism  . Autism causes difficulties in communication and social abilities. People with autism may also have strong interests--like Jake's interest in the stars at a young age. The symptoms of autism can range from mild to extremely severe. Asperser's is one of the milder forms of autism. Sometimes people with Asperser's, like Jake, develop extremely advanced skills in science, music or art. When Jake was in elementary school, his parents worried that the effects of his Asperser's were worsening. He became quiet. _ So a doctor recommended that Jake's parents let him study more advanced subjects, like math and physics. Jake's mother asked an astronomy professor to let Jake sit in on his class. Now, Jake studies advanced sciences like electromagnetic physics at IUPUI. But Jake thinks it's important to have a normal life too. He likes to play Guitar Hero with his friends and watch science fiction movies. He also enjoys playing classical music on the piano.But for Jake, studying physics is the most important thing.

Still, I felt energetic; despite the hills it was going to be a fine run. Just ahead of me was Peggy Mimno, a teacher from Mount Kiseo, New York. She too was running easily, moving along at my speed. The pace felt comfortable, so I decided to stay where I was; why pay attention to pace when she was setting such a nice one? I'd overtake  her later on when she tired. So I ran behind her. The course headed north for miles, wandered west for a hilly mile, then turned south again along a winding road. The race was getting harder. We had four miles left and already it was beginning to be real work. Peggy overtook a young runner. She seemed to know him, for they exchanged a few cheerful words as she passed him. Their exchange worried me. You don't chat during a race unless you feeling good, and Peggy plainly was. Still, I was close enough to overtake her if she tired, so I didn't give up hope completely.

That's right, animals. Scientists have begun to understand what farmers have known for thousands of years. Animals often seem to know in advance that an earthquake is coming, and they show their fear by acting in strange ways. Before a Chinese quake in 1975, snakes awoke from their winter sleep early only to freeze to death in the cold air. Cows broke their halters   and tried to escape. Chickens refused to enter their cage. All of this unusual behavior, as well as physical changes in the earth, warned Chinese scientists of the coming quake. They moved people away from the danger zone and saved thousands of lives. One task for scientists today is to learn exactly which types of animal behavior predict quakes. It's not an easy job. First of all not every animal reacts to the danger of an earthquake. Just before a California quake in 1977, for example, an Arabian horse became very nervous and tried to break out of his enclosure. The Australian horse next to him, however, remained perfectly calm. It's also difficult at times to tell the difference between normal animal restlessness and \"earthquake nerves\". A zoo keeper once called earthquake researchers to say that his cougar had been acting strangely. It turned out that the cat had an upset stomach. A second task for scientists is to find out exactly what kind of warnings the animals receive. They know that animals sense far more of the world than humans do. Many animals can see, hear, and smell things that people do not even notice. Some can sense tiny changes in air pressure, gravity, or the magnetism of Earth. This extra sense probably helps animals predict quakes. A good example of this occurred with a group of dogs. They were shut in an area that was being shaken by a series of tiny earthquakes. (Several small quakes often come before or after a large one.) Before each quake a low booming sound was heard. Each boom caused the dogs to bark wildly. Then the dogs began to bark during a silent period. A scientist who was recording quakes looked at his machine. It was acting as though there were a loud noise too. The scientist realized that the dogs had reacted to a booming noise. They also sensed the tiny quake that followed it. The machine recorded both, though humans felt and heard nothing. In this case there was a machine to monitor what the dogs were sensing. Many times, however, our machines record nothing extraordinary, even though animals know a quake is coming.

First of all not every animal reacts to the danger of an earthquake. Just before a California quake in 1977, for example, an Arabian horse became very nervous and tried to break out of his enclosure. The Australian horse next to him, however, remained perfectly calm. It's also difficult at times to tell the difference between normal animal restlessness and \"earthquake nerves\". A zoo keeper once called earthquake researchers to say that his cougar had been acting strangely. It turned out that the cat had an upset stomach. A second task for scientists is to find out exactly what kind of warnings the animals receive. They know that animals sense far more of the world than humans do. Many animals can see, hear, and smell things that people do not even notice. Some can sense tiny changes in air pressure, gravity, or the magnetism of Earth. This extra sense probably helps animals predict quakes. A good example of this occurred with a group of dogs. They were shut in an area that was being shaken by a series of tiny earthquakes. (Several small quakes often come before or after a large one.) Before each quake a low booming sound was heard. Each boom caused the dogs to bark wildly. Then the dogs began to bark during a silent period. A scientist who was recording quakes looked at his machine. It was acting as though there were a loud noise too. The scientist realized that the dogs had reacted to a booming noise. They also sensed the tiny quake that followed it. The machine recorded both, though humans felt and heard nothing. In this case there was a machine to monitor what the dogs were sensing. Many times, however, our machines record nothing extraordinary, even though animals know a quake is coming. The animals might be sensing something we measure but do not recognize as a warning. Discovering what animals sense, and learning how they know it is a danger signal, is a job for future scientists. The scientists did an experiment with a group of dogs to   _  .", "subject": ""}

{"answer": 3, "choices": ["She thinks that her parents'families have a lot in common with each other.", "She believes that her mother and father's families should learn from each other.", "She prefers her father's family's casual way of celebrating Thanksgiving to her mother's family's way.", "She enjoys spending time both of her parents'families although they are quite different."], "question": "The winter holiday season is the busiest time of the year in the US, and Thanksgiving is the one holiday this time of year that doesn't get the attention it deserves -- it is often overshadowed by Christmas. However, I still feel the festive atmosphere in my family. Each year, I attend not just one Thanksgiving dinner, but typically between three and four. Thanksgiving lasts all throughout the second half of the week. I travel to different houses to spend time with different parts of my family. We usually eat a giant amount of traditional Thanksgiving foods such as deviled eggs, ham, green beans, potatoes, and breads. We don't eat the traditional turkey like many families do, but we have just about everything else that someone would want to eat. After eating, we sit around and chat. Usually someone has brought a guest, such as a new boyfriend/girlfriend or a new baby, so there's always a chance to get to know the new family member, as well as catching up with family that I haven't seen for a long time. My extended families are very different, which makes for different holiday experiences. My other's family is very polite and quiet, and that makes the dinner with them seem very formal. My father's family is the opposite. They're loud and don't even try to control what words come out of their mouths. Their Thanksgiving usually includes yelling at whatever football game is on the television. It's very casual and relaxed. Either way, it's nice to be able to see my family and spend time with them. In my eyes, Thanksgiving is a holiday based on being thankful for what you have, spending tine with family, and eating a lot more food than you probably should. Not all these things go with its history, but it makes for a nice tradition. What does the author think of her parents'families?", "subject": ""}
