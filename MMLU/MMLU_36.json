However, a recent study has shown an increase in the number of injuries in P.E. classes. Researchers say one possible reason for this is a decrease in the number of school nurses.

With renewed optimism, he made better deals and extended terms of payment. He closed several big deals. Within a few months, he was out of debt and making money once again. Exactly one year later, he returned to the park with the uncashed check. At the agreed-upon time, the old man appeared. But just as the businessman was about to hand back the check and share his success story, a nurse came running up and grabbed the old man. \"I'm so glad I caught him!\" she cried. \"I hope he hasn't been bothering you. He's always escaping from the rest home and telling people he's John D. Rockefeller.\" And she led the old man away by the arm. The businessman stood there, still and shocked. All year long he'd been wheeling and dealing, buying and selling, believing that he had half a million dollars behind him. Suddenly he realized that it wasn't the money, real or imagined, that had turned his life around. It was his newfound self-confidence that had given him the power to achieve anything he wanted to.

{"answer": 1, "choices": ["Adolescents.", "Parents .", "Educators", ".Bosses"], "question": "Parenting the adolescent does take a different approach than parenting younger kids. Looking back it seemed  ly easy. They were born itty-bitty so you could take control - usually to keep them safe from harm, to teach right from wrong and begin to equip them with problem solving and relationship skills. But hey, remember when they were about two or three years old and they began to toddle  off and test your limits? This was normal child development and you soon trusted that your child wouldn't touch the stove, muck about in the flowerpots or bite the cat.       Adolescence is kind of similar in process to the two or three year old testing their limits. In adolescence though the test is more towards social limits: who they can go out with, when, where and for how long. Unlike the young child though, adolescence is nerve-wracking  because now they are truly out of sight, the stakes are higher and your didn't raise your kid for 13 years plus to see them get into trouble now. Also unlike the young child, your teen is no longer itty-bitty and you can't simply tell them what to do.        Parenting the adolescent requires extreme trust, patience and letting them take responsibility for decisions even when the consequences are not favorable. They do need to learn what the mantle of responsibility means during adolescence so that as adults they are suitably equipped to then carry on responsibly. No practice - no mastery. Taking responsibility takes practice and opportunity.       Difficult as _ may seem, the parenting style has to shift from being the boss to being a consultant. Now, no one is saying here that there aren't any rules, but they are more flexible and more subject to negotiation.

Also unlike the young child, your teen is no longer itty-bitty and you can't simply tell them what to do.        Parenting the adolescent requires extreme trust, patience and letting them take responsibility for decisions even when the consequences are not favorable. They do need to learn what the mantle of responsibility means during adolescence so that as adults they are suitably equipped to then carry on responsibly. No practice - no mastery. Taking responsibility takes practice and opportunity.       Difficult as _ may seem, the parenting style has to shift from being the boss to being a consultant. Now, no one is saying here that there aren't any rules, but they are more flexible and more subject to negotiation. When you were the boss, you simply told your young child what to do and you expected them to follow your wishes. Now as a consultant you are more in an advisory position and must rely on the judgment of your teen to choose correctly. It can be inferred from the text that   _  .", "subject": ""}
{"answer": 1, "choices": ["Time.", "Money.", "Attention.", "Compassion."], "question": "It's no secret that doing good makes others happy - but did you know it can make you happy as well? According to a study, people participating in meaningful activities were happier and felt that their lives had more purpose than people who only engaged in pleasure-seeking behaviors. Try giving these four things to others to start your journey to a happier and healthier lifestyle. 1. Your Time With a busy life, it can be hard to find any time to give away. However, volunteering your time has great benefits, including making new friends and connections, learning new skills and even advancing your career. According to a paper about the link between health and volunteering, volunteering is connected with lower instances of depression and reduces the risk of dying by 22 percent. 2. Your Attention Most of us think we're good listeners, but according to psychologist Paul Donoghue, most people are aware that others don't listen as well as they could. In addition, they're not fully aware that they themselves aren't listening. When practicing mindfulness meditation , you focus on what you experience in the moment and let your thoughts and emotions pass through without judgment. Did you know that giving someone your undivided attention helps you also? When done well, active listening strengthens your focus-which is a major part of good meditation. 3. Your Compassion The psychological meaning of compassion is the ability to understand another person's emotional state. Compassion differs from empathy  in that those who experience compassion not only put themselves in another person's shoes, but also want to reduce that person's suffering. A brain-imaging study showed that the brain's pleasure centers are equally active when we give money to the poor as when we receive money ourselves. 4. Your Money According to an experiment, those who spend money on other people are significantly happier than those who spend the same quantity of money on themselves. Whether or not you can offer other gifts, donating money helps make real change happen. It represents time spent, compassion and careful attention to the needs of others.

Sometimes, the dead ant get moved away very soon--within an hour of dying. This behavior is interesting to scientists, who wonder how ants know for sure--and so soon--that another ant is dead. One scientist recently came up with a way to explain this ant behavior. Dong-Hwan Choe is a biologist. Choe found that Argentine ants have a chemical on the outside of their bodies that signals to other ants, \"I'm dead--take me away.\" But there's a _ to Choe's discovery. Choe says that the living ants--not just the dead ones--have this death chemical. In other words, while an ant crawls around, perhaps in a picnic or home, it's telling other ants that it's dead. What keeps ants from dragging away the living ants?Choe found that Argentine ants have two additional chemicals on their bodies, and these tell nearby ants something like, \"Wait--I'm not dead yet.\" So Choe's research turned up two sets of chemical signals in ants: one says, \"I'm dead,\" and the other set says, \"I'm not dead yet.\" Other scientists have tried to figure out how ants know when another ant is dead. If an ant is knocked unconscious, for example, other ants leave it alone until it wakes up. That means ants know that unmoving ants can still be alive. Choe suspects that when an Argentine ant dies, the chemical that says \"Wait-I'm not dead yet\" quickly goes away. Once that chemical is gone, only the one that says \"I'm dead\" is left. \"It's because the dead ant no longer smells like a living ant that it gets carried to the graveyard, not because its body releases  new unique chemicals after death,\" said Choe. When other ants detect the \"dead\" chemical without the \"not dead yet\" chemical, they drag away the body. Understanding this behavior may help scientists figure out how to stop Argentine ants from invading new places and causing problems. Choe would like to find a way to use the newly discovered chemicals to spread ant killer to Argentine ant nests. The ants' removal behavior is important to the overall health of the nest. \"Being able to quickly remove dead individuals and other possible sources of disease is extremely important to all animals living in societies, including us,\" says Choe. \"Think about all the effort and money that we invest daily in waste management.\" Ants judge whether another one is dead or not depending on  _  .", "subject": ""}

The study found that when men expressed their opinion with anger , participants rated them as more believable . But when women expressed anger , they were viewed as more emotional and , thus , less convincing . In other words , a man could benefit from using anger in power and persuasion . A woman , however , could be ignored or hurt by her group if she expressed anger . The study was based on the responses of 210 students . They were shown evidence and photographs online from a real murder trial . A man had supposedly murdered his wife . The students were asked to decide if the man was guilty or not .

The report concludes that climate change causes real risk to human health and human system that supports the way of life in the United States. Man-made global warming is caused by greenhouse gases from the burning of fossil fuels. At current emission   levels, global temperatures are likely to rise by about 2 degrees by midcentury and about 7.5 degrees by the end of the century. The most vulnerable   Americans -- the poor, elderly, sick, very young and immigrants -- will suffer more. That's at least 10 percent of the country's population, probably more. It will be tougher for these people to get enough health care for climate-related illnesses, to cool down in heat waves, to escape extreme events such as Hurricane Katrina, and even to get enough food. While every region of America is vulnerable to global warming's health and welfare effects, more people are moving to coastal regions, which are most vulnerable to climate change because of drought and hurricanes.

But uppermost in our minds is the final destination. On a certain day at a certain hour, we will pull into the station. Bands will be playing and flags waving. Once we get there, so many wonderful dreams will come true and the pieces of our lives will fit together like a completed jigsaw  puzzle. How restlessly we pace the aisles , condemning the minutes for loitering --waiting, waiting, waiting for the station. \"When we reach the station, that will be it!\" we cry. \"When I'm 38.\" \"When I buy a new 450SL Mercdes Benz!\" \"When I put the last kid through college.\" \"When I have paid off the loan!\" \"When I get a promotion.\" \"When I reach the age of retirement, I shall live happily ever after! \" Sooner or later, we must realize there is no station, no one place to arrive at once and for all. The true joy of life is the trip. The station is only a dream.

{"answer": 0, "choices": ["Institutions worldwide are hiring administrators from the U.S.", "More international students are being admitted to American universities.", "University presidents are paying more attention to fund-raising.", "A lot of activists are being hired as administrators."], "question": "When next year's crop of high-school graduates arrive at Oxford University in the fall, they will be joined by a new face: Andrew Hamilton, the 55-year-old provost   of Yale, who will become Oxford's vice-chancellor -- a position equal to university president in America. Hamilton isn't the only educator crossing the Atlantic. Schools in France, Egypt, Singapore, etc. have also recently made top-level hires from abroad. Yet the talent flow isn't universal. High-level personnel   tend to head in only one direction: Outward from America. The chief reason is that American schools don't tend to seriously consider looking abroad. For example, when the board of the University of Colorado searched for a new president, it wanted a leader familiar with the state government, a major source of the university's budget. \"We didn't do any global consideration,\" says Patricia Hayes, the board's chair. The board finally picked Bruce Benson, a 69-year-old Colorado businessman and political activist who is likely to do well in the main task of modern university presidents: fund-raising. Fund-raising is a particularly American thing, since U.S. schools rely heavily on donations. The fund-raising ability is largely a product of experience and necessity. Many European universities, meanwhile, are still mostly dependent on government funding. But government support has failed to keep pace with rising student numbers. The decline in government support has made fund-raising an increasingly necessary ability among administrators  , and has made hiring committees hungry for Americans. In the past few years, well-known schools around the world have joined the trend. In 2011, when Cambridge University appointed Alison Richard, another former Yale provost, as its vice-chancellor, the university publicly stressed that in her previous job she had overseen   \" a major strengthening of Yale's financial position\".

It's true! And you can do it too. Many companies in the USA need translators now to translate simple documents online from Chinese to English, such as emails, website content, movie subtitles and more. Companies like Real Translator Jobs are actively seeking translators from China to fill demand. There are more translation jobs than people to complete them. This leaves a big opportunity for anyone to start doing this and earn extra money. Do you have to speak perfect English? No! Even basic knowledge of English is OK. This is really a job for anyone from China who wants to do it. We spoke to one student from Beijing, Harris, who has been doing this for 2 years now and is earning between $150 and $225 every day. He completes about 3 to 4 jobs per day which takes him about 3 hours. It's an incredible amount of money to earn on your spare time!

Their company, Zeo, based in Newton, Mass, launched its product in June, 2009.The Zeo device uses a headband with tiny sensors   that scan your brain for signs of four sleep states- REM, light, deep and waking sleep.The smart alarm clock displays a graph of your sleep pattern and wakes you as you're not in REM sleep (which is when you're least groggy).In the morning you can upload the data to the company's Web site, and so track your sleep over time.Most of the feedback comes in the form of Zeo's ZQ score showing how well you've slept. \"Zeo allows people to unlock this black box of sleep,\" says Dave Dickinson, a health-care CEO. Whether any of this actually improves sleep is up to the consumer, who will also need to make lifestyle changes like cutting out alcohol before bedtime or caffeine after 3 pm. For now the company is selling Zeo online only.Dickinson also plans to spread it to countries such as Australia, where sleep deprivation approaches US levels.

{"answer": 1, "choices": ["Her musical partner.", "Her voiced style.", "Jazz instrumentalists.", "Her way of singing."], "question": "Billie Holiday was an American jazz singer and songwriter. Nicknamed Lady Day by her loyal friend and musical partner, Lester Young, Holiday was a great influence on jazz and pop singing. Her voiced style, strongly inspired by jazz instrumentalists, pioneered a new way of controlling tempo  . Above all, she was admired for her deeply personal and direct approach to singing. Billie Holiday was born Eleanora Fagan on April 7, 1915, in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania. Her father, Clarence Halliday (Holiday), a musician, did not marry or live with her mother. Her mother had moved to Philadelphia when thirteen, after being driven away from her parents' home in Sandtown-Winchester, Baltimore for becoming pregnant. With no support from her own parents, Holiday's mother arranged for the young Holiday to stay with her older married half sister, Eva Miller, who lived in Baltimore. During her final period of separation from her mother, Holiday began to perform the songs she learned while working in the brothel  . By early 1929, Holiday joined her mother in Harlem. Their landlady was a sharply dressed woman named Florence Williams, who ran a brothel at 151 West 140th Street. In order to live, Holiday and her mother had to work there. Holiday had not yet turned fourteen at that time. On May 2, 1929, the house was raided  , and Holiday and her mother were sent to prison. After spending some time in a workhouse, her mother was released in July, followed by Holiday in October, at the age of 14. She co-wrote a few songs, and several of them have become jazz standards, notably God Bless the Child, Don't Explain, and Lady Sings the Blues. She also became famous for singing jazz standards written by others, including Easy Living and Strange Fruit. Her early career is hard to track down exactly. But, she later gained work singing in local jazz clubs before being spotted by a talent scout  , John Hammond, in 1933, aged 18. Her voice and recordings are loved for the depth of emotion and intensity she could bring to classic standards. Her range of voice was not the greatest, but, her extraordinary gravelly   voice was soon to become very famous and influential. She was an important icon of the jazz era and influential in the development of jazz singing. In the late 1930s she began singing a civil rights song called Strange Fruit--a song which told the tale of a lynching   of a black man in the deep south. It was very controversial for that period and it was not played on radios. It was recorded for Commodore records and she performed it many times over the next 20 years. In early 1959 she found out that she had cirrhosis   of the liver. The doctor told her to stop drinking, which she did for a short time, but soon returned to heavy drinking. By May she had lost twenty pounds, friends Leonard Feather, Joe Glaser, and Allan Morrison tried to get her to check into to a hospital, she put them off.  On May 31, 1959, Holiday was taken to Metropolitan Hospital in New York suffering from liver and heart disease. She was arrested for drug possession as she lay dying, and her hospital room was raided by authorities. Police officers were stationed at the door to her room. Holiday remained under police guard at the hospital until she died from cirrhosis of the liver on July 17, 1959.Billie Holiday had difficult life experiences which influenced her attitude towards life.

Just look at my name: Jean.Not Jean Marie,or Jeanine,or Jeanette,or even Jeanne.Just Jean.Did you know in France,they name boys Jean? It's French for John.And okay,I don't live in France.But still,I'm basically a girl named John.If I lived in France,anyway. This is the kind of luck I've had since before Mom even filled out my birth certificate.So it wasn't any big surprise to me when the cab driver didn't help me with my suitcase.I'd already had to tolerate arriving at the airport to find no one there to greet me,and then got no answer to my many phone calls,asking where my aunt and uncle were.Did they not want me after all? Had they changed their minds? Had they heard about my bad luck--all the way from Iowa--and decided they didn't want any of it to _ them? So when the cab driver,instead of getting out and helping me with my bags,just pushed a little button so that the trunk   popped open a few inches,it wasn't the worst thing that had ever happened to me.It wasn't even the worst thing that had happened to me that day. According to my mom,most brownstones in New York City were originally single-family homes when they were built way back in the 1800s.But now they've been divided up into apartments,so that there's one--or sometimes even two or more families--per floor. Not Mom's sister Evelyn's brownstone,though.Aunt Evelyn and Uncle Ted Gardiner own all four floors of their brownstone.That's practically one floor per person,since Aunt Evelyn and Uncle Ted only have three kids,my cousins Tory,Teddy,and Alice. Back home,we just have two floors,but there are seven people living on them.And only one bathroom.Not that I'm complaining.Still,ever since my sister Courtney discovered blow-outs,it's been pretty frightful at home. But as tall as my aunt and uncle's house was,it was really narrow--just three windows across.Still,it was a very pretty townhouse,painted gray.The door was a bright,cheerful yellow.There were yellow flower boxes along the base of each window,flower boxes from which bright red--and obviously newly planted,since it was only the middle of April,and not quite warm enough for them. It was nice to know that,even in a sophisticated   city like New York,people still realized how homey and welcoming a box of flowers could be.The sight of those flowers cheered me up a little.

The proposal comes only days after the Government said that lessons in manners--including respect for the elderly and how to say \"please\" and \"thank you\"--should be taught in secondary schools to combat bad behavior. Lord Layard, the director of the wellbeing program at the LSE's Center for Economic Performance, said: \"Learning hard things takes an enormous amount of practice. To play the violin well takes 10,000 hours of practice. How can we expect people to learn to be happy without large amounts of practice and repetition?\" It is believed that at least two percent of British children under 12 now struggle with significant depression.

The mix of Scottish and Irish musical traditions inspired Declan and became his early musical influence. k%s5$u Declan's talent was publicly acknowledged   for the first time when, at just 7 years old, he insisted on singing at the annual Rochester Dickens Festival, a two-day event where people were invited to dress up in Victorian costumes to celebrate the life and times of the famous novelist Charles Dickens and his links with town. Little Declan, dressed up as a chimney sweep, started singing. Soon after this, he started to enter local talent contests and within a year he had won 15 titles and more than PS1000. His first self-titled album, Declan, with Irish traditional songs and some specially written materials became a big success and charted in the UK and Ireland. Within the year of release   , it had 200 000 copies in Germany. Although Declan is a British citizen and singer, Declan is better-known abroad, especially in China where his songs were chosen as part of the Chinese education curriculum for children learning English.

The young man decided to donate his money after getting to know Army Sgt.

Ebola is named after the Ebola River, where it was first discovered in 1976. There are five different types of the Ebola virus, each named after where they first happened: Sudan, Ivory Coast, Restoon, Bundibugyo, and Zaire.

They also include the CETP and the ApoC3 genes, which are found in 10 percent of young people, but in about 20 percent of people over 100 years old. Some of those genes were discovered by a research group at the Albert Einstein College of Medicine in New York, led by Professor Nir Barzilai. The team studied the genes of over 500 people over 100 years old, and their children. The studies show that tiny mutations   in the make-up of some genes can greatly increase a person's lifespan  . Barzilai told a Royal Society conference that the discovery of such genes gave scientists clear targets for developing drugs that could prevent age-related diseases, allow people to live longer and stay healthy. David Gems, a researcher at University College London, believes that drugs to slow ageing will become widespread. \"If we know which genes control longevity   then we can ... target them with drugs. That makes it possible to slow down ageing,\" he told The Times. \"Much of the pain and suffering in the world are caused by ageing. If we can find a way to reduce that, then we are obliged   to take it.\" According to David Gems,   _  .", "subject": ""}

He was often called humble, charming, loyal person and a man who cared about others. \"He seemed to have that special charismatic  personality,\" said Herman Cohen, U.S. assistant secretary of state for Africa from 1989 to 1993. \"He became the symbol in the fight against _ .\" Mandela was born on July 18, 1918. As a young man he became active in the anti-apartheid movement and joined the African National Congress, or ANC, in the 1940s. The white-led government banned the ANC in 1960, but the group continued to operate secretly. Mandela became head of the group's new military wing, coordinating a sabotage campaign against South African military and government targets. In 1962, he was arrested and put on trial for his actions and sentenced to life in prison on Robben Island off the coast of Cape Town. He spent 18 years there, refusing a government offer to release him if he would renounce the ANC's armed struggle. But he was freed in 1990 after South African President Frederik de Klerk legalized all political parties and discharged most political prisoners. Shortly after his release, Mandela was elected president of the African National Congress. And in 1994, when the ANC won South Africa's first all-race elections, he was inaugurated   as the county's first black president at age 75. \"Never, never and never again shall it be that this beautiful land will again experience the oppression of one by another,\" he said. President Mandela said he would stay for only one five-year term. Cohen says Mandela earned international respect for South Africa's national reconciliation. \"Mandela devoted himself mainly to rallying the Africans to this new era to work on economic development, having good education, also he was very much of a spokesman on the international scene.\" he said. In 1993, Mandela shared the Nobel Peace Prize with his once bitter enemy F.W. de Klerk for their contribution to the peace process in South Africa. After receiving the award, Mandela praised the South African people. \"All have created a society which recognizes that all people are born equal,\" he said.

Though laws may prevent us from doing things we wish to do at the moment, laws make everyone's life safer and more pleasant. Without laws we could not hold on to our property; we could not go to bed at night expecting to wake up in the morning and find that we had not been robbed; no stores in which we buy food, clothes, and other necessities could stay open and sell to us.

It is not the laws that should be feared but the trouble that comes to everyone when laws are broken. Once this is understood, a citizen will not fear or hate the law. Understanding the need for good laws and the evil results of breaking laws is the first requirement of good citizenship and government. Philosophers once believed that in prehistoric time people lived without laws in a \"state of nature\". People were free to do as they pleased unless someone stronger stopped them by force.

Push them out The traditional Chinese belief of the exploration of knowledge and truth emphasizes \"reading 10,000 books and traveling 10,000 miles\", which indicates the importance of experience as much as theory. But while Chinese universities have the tradition of spring outings, what's the benefit of making spring break an institution? Qin Jianguo, of the student affairs office at Shenzhen University, thinks the idea of the spring break in some universities in China comes from the intention of pushing students out of the ivory tower to experience more diversity in their lives. \"Take traveling for example. A week traveling is a very different experience to a one- or two-day outing,\" said Qin. \"Students are expected to acquire the spirit of teamwork and compromise, and learn survival and communication skills when put out there in an unfamiliar context.\" Diverse approaches Many countries have similar vacations in the middle of the semester for students to do things out of their own interest. Taking Japan as an example, instead of partying like their US counterparts, many Japanese students choose to work as interns or engage in study-related projects. \"The spring break is an opportunity for many of our students to put their learning to use,\" said Hiroshi Kanno, dean of the Graduate School of International Corporate Strategy at Hitotsubashi University, in the school's description of a recent spring break project. As for Chinese students who take a week off around the Labor Day holiday, many tend to do volunteer work. Duan Zhipeng, a 22-year-old economics major at Renmin University, applied for a project to go back to his hometown in Jiangxi province to introduce his university's enrollment policies and campus culture to local high school students. Not a trend yet Apart from Renmin University, only a few other universities, such as Yantai University, have a spring break for their students. The concept in China is still far from the culture and norms built around it in the US. Wei Xiang, a professor specializing in holiday economics at Beijing International Studies University, said that the spring break is a good experiment for universities to make study schedules smoother in order to give students more options to arrange their own leisure and study activities.

Whatever your hands touch, your phones touch. It has been discovered that some phones have 18 times more bacteria and viruses than any surface in a public restroom. So it probably won't surprise you that a 2011 University of London study found that one in six of our phones have bacteria and viruses on them--specifically, the bacteria called E. coli. The research on bacteria and viruses led to the invention of Phone Soap. It is not actually liquid like dishwasher soap. It is a phone charger that uses the electromagnetic radiation   used in hospitals to kill 99.9 percent of bacteria and viruses, cleaning your phone while it charges. \"There are really certain types of bacteria and viruses that we should not be in touch with, and they are really on our phones,\" says Wes Barnes, the Phone Soap co-founder. It all started while his cousin and co-founder, Dan LaPorte, was in his cancer research lab at college. \"He realized he got the idea of getting rid of bacteria and viruses on the phones,\" said Barnes. \"In the lab they used UV-C light for destroying them. He realized this would be the fastest, most powerful way to kill any bacteria and viruses living on electronic machines.\" Phone Soap looks like a little metal suitcase. Your phone rests in to charge and get cleaned at the same time. Instead of plugging your phone into the wall, you'd plug it into the Phone Soap charger box. The process only takes a few minutes but, Barnes says, \"The idea is that you can leave it in there overnight if you want to keep charging. Reflective paint keeps the light completely around the phone so it cleans the phone fully.\" The co-founders spent 2013 finding the right companies and they started shipping the product in late November. By last week's International Consumer Electronics Show in Las Vegas, Phone Soap was all grown-up. Both co-founders have left their previous jobs and are selling Phone Soap nonstop. \"We're shipping almost more than we can handle each day,\" Barnes says. \"It's been a great adventure.\" According to the passage, Phone Soap   _  .", "subject": ""}

Part of the confusion about how to practice meditation effectively is due to the fact that there are literally hundreds of techniques championed by various groups and individuals. As a general principle, it might be said that all meditation techniques seek to have the practitioner attain a state of consciousness that is different to our ordinary state of awareness. They attempt to train people to clear their minds and achieve a sense of inner peace. It sounds simple enough, but of the huge number of people experiment with meditation, very few are able to maintain its practice over the long haul. In most cases, this is due to frustration over the inability to experience any dramatic, instantly recognizable effects. This is quite a sad state of affairs, that so few these days are willing or equipped to persist in something that doesn't provide immediate life-changing results. It reflects a culture in which demands for discipline and sustained effort are considered unnecessary or even unfair. It is no surprise therefore that many people abandon their efforts at meditation before they have a chance to bear fruit. But for anyone who does decide to take up this worthwhile practice, please remember. You must clear your mind, relax and \"take it as it comes\". Maintain the practice with a sense of discipline and devotion, and eventually benefits of inner peace and calm will be yours. Who is the probable audience for this article?", "subject": ""}

His unfinished poem, which could otherwise have been a masterpiece, would now never be more than a fragment. This story tells how unexpected communication can destroy an important thought, which bring us to the cellphone. The most common complaint about cellphones is that people talk on them to the annoyance of people around them. But more damaging may be the cellphone's interruption of our thoughts. We have already entered a golden age of little white lies about our cellphones, and this is by and large a healthy, protective development. \"I didn't hear it ring\" or \"I didn't realize my phone had shut off\" are among the lies we tell to give ourselves space where we're beyond reach. The notion of being unreachable is not a new concept--we have \"Do Not Disturb\" sign on the doors of hotel rooms. So why must we feel guilty when it comes to cellphones? Why must we apologize if we decide to shut off the phone for a while? Now time alone, or a conversation with someone next to us which cannot be interrupted by a phone, is something to be cherished.

The Gaze Group has been developing eye-controlled computer technology for nearly 20 years.But those devices have been firstly designed to help those with disabilities,and are very expensive. \"After a while,we figured out that probably the best way is to go for a mass-market way,\" says Gaze's Sune Alstrup Johansen.\"where everybody would have this available.\" Johansen and some of his colleagues have formed a new company,the Eye Tribe,which is hoping to develop the technology on a mass commercial level. The technology works with the help of the computing device toward the user's face.

Now, we see the most exciting urban innovations to show you exactly how they'll improve your city's infrastructure . Lighting Up The Night Anthony Di Mari dreamed up an electric tree to help irrigate public parks and light them at night. These electric trees contain a special infill   that collects water from rainfall. The water is then distributed through a shallow underground irrigation system with the help from the trees' swaying movement. An electric motor turns energy from the waving of the artificial trees into electricity, which is used to light up the trees' outer LEDs. Thinking Outside The Box As more people flock to urban areas, city planners will need to get increasingly creative about how to satisfy residents' health and transportation needs within decreasing available space. One way to achieve this is by updating infrastructure to support biking and walking by building suspended  roundabouts like hovering in the Netherlands. By lifting bicycle and pedestrian traffic above busy roadways, cities can significantly decrease over-crowded traffic condition. Waving Hello To Clean Energy Cities that don't receive enough sunlight may find an attractive alternative in wave power. Since ocean waves rarely experience disruption , electric engines driven by their clockwork push-and-pull can reliably provide power throughout the year.

Researchers have just offered evidence in a study that says obesity  appears to spread through society. But the findings might also offer hope.  If friends help make obesity acceptable, then they might also be influential in losing the fat. The researchers note that support groups are already an effective tool in dealing with other socially influenced problems, like alcoholism .  The findings appeared in the New England Journal of Medicine. The researchers used information collected from 12,000 people. It was collected between 1972 and 2003 as part of the Framingham Heart Study.  The information was highly detailed. There was even contact information for close friends of the people in the study. The researchers examined more than 40,000 social ties. They found a person's chances of becoming severely overweight increased by 50% if a friend had become obese. A sister or brother of a person who became obese had a 40% increased chance of becoming obese. The risk for a wife or husband was a little less than that. Nicholas Christakis of Harvard Medical School was a lead researcher in the study. He says there is a direct causal relationship between a person getting fat and being followed in weight gain by a friend. The study found that the sex of the friends was also an influence. In same-sex friendship, a person had a 71% increased risk of becoming obese. Men had a 44% increased risk of becoming obese after weight gain in a brother. In sisters, it was 67%. The researchers also considered the effect of where people lived in relation to each other. James Fowler of the University of California was the other lead expert. He says a friend who lives a few hundred kilometers away has as much influence as one in the same neighborhood.

In Europe, the Greeks were the earliest to use the umbrella as a sunshade.And the umbrella was allowed in common use in ancient Greece.But it is believed that the earliest persons in Europe to use the umbrella as protection against rain were the ancient Romans. During the Middle Ages, the use of the umbrella practically disappeared.Then it appeared again in Italy in the late sixteenth century.And again, it was considered a symbol of power and authority.In around 1680, the umbrella appeared in France and later on in England. By the eighteenth century, the umbrella was used against rain throughout most of Europe.Umbrellas have not changed much in style during all this time, though they have become  much lighter in weight.It wasn't until the twentieth century that women's umbrellas began to be made in a whole variety of colors.

Many did return home within a year, but others rejected the past completely and are now living a new life somewhere under a different identity. To those left behind this form of desertion is a terrible blow to their pride and self-confidence. Even the finality of death might be preferable. At least it does not imply rejection or failure. Worse than that, people can be left with an unfinished marriage, not knowing whether they will have to wait seven years before they are free to start a fresh life. Clinical psychologist Paul Brown believes most departures of this kind to be well planned rather than impulsive. \"It's typical of the kind of personality which seems able to ignore other people's pain and difficulties. Running away, like killing yourself, is a highly aggressive act. By creating an absence the people left behind feel guilty, upset and empty.\" What's the author's attitude towards the departures of this kind?", "subject": ""}

They are so improbable looking that you simply look in wonder. It seems that nothing that large could be natural-- and then it strikes you that something so large could only be natural.   Now, people realize that as climate change is raising global temperatures, more icebergs are being born. Antarctica creates far more of them than Greenland, the source of bergs in Arctic waters. Antarctica's are also much larger, sometimes reaching the size of small countries. Recent data show the average atmospheric temperature has increased about 4.5degF in the western Antarctic Peninsula since the 1940s, making the region, among the fastest warming on earth. This jump has been shown in the recent breaking of major ice shelves along the Antarctic Peninsula. As a result, thousands of new icebergs have broken off, from ice shelves into the Southern Ocean at an accelerated rate. Even as more icebergs are being created, scientists are learning that these beauties are far from inactive masses of ice. In fact, they strikingly alter their environments biologically, chemically, and physically, making them islands of life in the open sea. Observers at sea had long remarked that they attract seals, and seabirds, and divers had noticed that fish are more numerous near them than in the surrounding sea. Now scientists are learning just what the attraction is all about. Depending on their size, location, and the season, icebergs can be nurturers or destroyers. During their existence--typically years from breaking off from an Antarctic or Greenlandic glacier to their gradual melting as they float into lower altitudes, they support animals on, around, even inside their splendid ice castle. They fertilize the ocean with nutrients, increasing sea creature production. Grounded bergs can shelter areas of the seafloor, protecting bottom-living creatures from free-floating icebergs. However, large bergs can also trap sea ice, preventing its annual breakup and thus stopping phytoplankton from getting life-giving sunlight, breaking the food chain at its first link. ... Icebergs will continue to astonish and attract visitors to the polar regions with their size and extraordinary beauty. But now these frozen masses are taking on a new dimension of wonder as we uncover their vital role in the environment of polar seas. No longer can we look at icebergs as mere passive beauties. They are active agents of change, each one an icy oasis with a wake of life as it floats on its unstoppable oceanic journey to melting. What can we learn from the passage?", "subject": ""}

Living with your classmates will make the transition   into college life a lot easier. As a freshman your classes should be easy. After freshman year your classes will become a lot more difficult, so I advise that you get down to business early in the first year. There are two very easy things you can do to increase your knowledge as a freshman. The first is to just go to class and the second is to always do your homework. I also highly advise that you do it on your own and try to stay disciplined. It is too easy to put your homework away and then get really behind and not be able to learn everything before a mid-term or final exam. The author writes the passage to   _  .", "subject": ""}

{"answer": 3, "choices": ["It can be made as easily as common rubber.", "It is environmentally-friendly.", "It can repair itself at room temperature.", "It is made of smaller molecules."], "question": "Broken rubber bands and flat tires requiring replacement could soon be a thing of the past. French researchers have developed a new kind of rubber that can repair itself when broken.The new rubber is made from widely available materials including vegetable oil and a common industrial chemical.All the materials are considered safe to the environment and can be easily reused. The best part is that the new rubber can be repaired and used again and again without losing its strength or ability or stretch.When cut, the rubber can be made new again, simply by pressing the two broken ends back together. The product can be repaired at room temperature, around twenty degrees Centigrade;other self-healing materials require higher temperatures for repair. Traditionally, rubber substances are made from huge molecules connected by strong chemical links, or bonds.The new rubber is made of smaller molecules.The molecules are linked together using hydrogen bonds.When connected in this way, the molecules act like one long molecule, forming what is called supramolecular networks .When the rubber is cut, the molecules attempt to connect with whatever molecule is near them.When pressed together, the molecules are able to repair themselves at the molecular level, making the repaired rubber like new.

{"answer": 2, "choices": ["In the researchers' diary.", "In a guide book.", "In a research magazine.", "In a newspaper."], "question": "Broken rubber bands and flat tires requiring replacement could soon be a thing of the past. French researchers have developed a new kind of rubber that can repair itself when broken.The new rubber is made from widely available materials including vegetable oil and a common industrial chemical.All the materials are considered safe to the environment and can be easily reused. The best part is that the new rubber can be repaired and used again and again without losing its strength or ability or stretch.When cut, the rubber can be made new again, simply by pressing the two broken ends back together. The product can be repaired at room temperature, around twenty degrees Centigrade;other self-healing materials require higher temperatures for repair. Traditionally, rubber substances are made from huge molecules connected by strong chemical links, or bonds.The new rubber is made of smaller molecules.The molecules are linked together using hydrogen bonds.When connected in this way, the molecules act like one long molecule, forming what is called supramolecular networks .When the rubber is cut, the molecules attempt to connect with whatever molecule is near them.When pressed together, the molecules are able to repair themselves at the molecular level, making the repaired rubber like new. However, time is an important element in the process.If the broken ends are not brought together quickly, a repair is not possible.This is because molecules will form bonds with molecules on their own side.The inventors say the surfaces of the rubber can be repaired within a week of being separated.

They've traveled in outer space, and some scientists think there might even be lichens on Mars. What you probably don't realize is that a lichen is more than a single thing. It includes two different types of living organisms: a fungus   and an alga  . Neither of these organisms is a plant, so the lichen isn't a plant either. Through photosynthesis  , the alga gets the sun's energy to make food for the fungus, which is the place for the alga to live in. However, the alga cannot leave the fungus. Around the world, scientists have found tens of thousands of types of lichens. Many may not even have been discovered yet. As scientists continue to find new kinds of lichens, they are also working to understand how they are connected to one another.

I heard nothing for a month and the money remained in my account when Daniel called, explaining he'd tried to get back his money but had been unsuccessful as neither the bank nor his company felt it was their error. He had rung to ask if I could speak to the bank, but after chatting for a few minutes we realized we could probably fix this problem ourselves. We decided I would take the money from my account and he would pick it up from me. Due to my busy job I was unable to meet Daniel personally but he left me a lovely bottle of wine in exchange for what was rightfully his. I never had any intention of keeping Daniel's pay but red tape made it difficult to do the right thing. It all came down to two people being able to do what a huge bank and a large company couldn't do -- admit a mistake has occurred and fix it. From the passage we can infer that   _  .", "subject": ""}

Every one of us gets so used to punctuation marks that not many of us give them a second thought. Actually, the ancient Greeks wrote this way. The lack of punctuation marks probably didn't bother good readers, though. As they read, they just put pauses where they fit best. Also at this time, sentences switched directions. A sentence read from left to right. The next one read right to left, and then left to right again, etc. The ancient Romans sometimes punctuated like this: They * put * something * that * can * separate * words * in * a * sentence. The word punctuation actually comes from this idea and the Latin word punctum, which means a dot. When the 5thcentury arrived, there were just two punctuation marks: spaces and points. The spaces separated words while the points showed pauses in reading. Then in the 13thcentury, a printer named Aldus Manutius tried to standardize punctuation. He always used a period for a complete stop at the end of a sentence. He used a slash (/) to indicate a short pause. Over time, that slash was shortened and curled, and it became the modern comma  . Since that time, other marks have enlarged the punctuation family. The exclamation mark   comes from the Latin word io. It means \"exclamation of joy.\" The question mark originally started out as the Latin word questio, meaning question. Eventually, scholars put it at the end of a sentence to show a question. Punctuation even keeps changing nowadays. New marks are coming into existence, and old punctuation marks are used in new ways. Take for example the \"interrobang\". This 1962 invention combines the question mark and exclamation mark for times when writers want both.

But if you want an absolutely unforgettable, no-admission-charged, 360-degree view of the entire Los Angeles region , it's yours. All you have to do is walk a little. One of the preferred exercise routes, the Mount Hollywood Trail, is easily accessed from the parking lot of the famous Griffith Observatory; you see what you get at the end of this steep 1.5-mile trail, which winds its way through the Griffith Park wilds up to the mountain's 1,640-foot peak. Bronx River, New York It may not be on your Top 10 list of things to do when you finally get to the Big Apple, but exploring the almost-secret river that flows through one of New York's most mysterious boroughs   is an unforgettable experience.

American researchers have put together a 700-year record of the rainy seasons, which is expected to provide guidance for experts making weather predictions. Every year, damp air masses,known as monsoon,produce large amounts of rainfall in India, East Asia, Northern Australia and East Africa. All this wet air is pulled in by a high pressure area over the Indian Ocean and a low pressure area to the south. According to Edward Cook , a weather expert at Columbia University in New York., the complex nature of the climate systems across Asia makes monsoons hard to predict. In addition, climate records for the area are too recent and not detailed enough to be of much use. Therefore, he and a team of researchers spent more than fifteen years traveling across Asia, looking for trees old enough to provide long-term records. They measured the rings, or circles, inside thousands of ancient trees in more than 300 places. Rainfall has a direct link to the growth and width of rings on some kinds of trees. The researchers developed a document they are calling a Monsoon Asia Drought Atlas. It shows the effect of monsoons over seven centuries, beginning in the 1300s. Professor Cook says the tree-ring records show periods of wet and dry weather. \"If the monsoon basically fails or is a very weak one, the trees affected by monsoons at that location might put on a very narrow ring. But if the monsoon is very strong, the trees affected by that monsoon might put on a wide ring for that year. So, the wide and narrow ring widths of the chronology that we developed in Asia provide us with a measure of monsoon variability.\" With all this information, researchers say they can begin to improve computer climate models for predicting the behavior of monsoons. \"There has been widespread famine and starvation and human dying in the past in large droughts. And on the other hand, if the monsoon is particularly heavy, it can cause extensive flooding.\" said Eugene Wahl, a scientist with America's National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration. \"So, to get a sense of what the regional moisture patterns have been, dryness and wetness over such a long period of time in great detail, I would call it a kind of victory for climate science.\" What's the passage mainly about?", "subject": ""}

The fanged creature is known as the Kashmir musk deer, and it is native to the Himalayas of northern India, Pakistan's Kashmir region and northern Afghanistan.  Only the male deer have fangs, and they use them during mating season to compete for females. A team of researchers scoured   Afghanistan's Nuristan province during 2008 and 2009, and recorded five sightings of the animal. This was the first time the species had been spotted since 1948. During the survey, the researchers spotted a single male Kashmir musk deer near the same area three separate times. The researchers also recorded one female and her baby, and saw a second single female that they think may have been the same deer, without her baby. These musk deer are classified as an endangered species on the International Union for Conservation of Nature's Red List. Musk-deer meat is a local delicacy, but the species is mostly hunted for its scent glands that are more valuable by weight than gold -- some believe the glands have pharmaceutical  properties, and they sell for nearly $20,455 per pound ($45,000 per kilogram) on the black market, according to the International Union for Conservation of Nature. Three decades of war have ravaged Nuristan province, and the continued violence and political instability make the black-market trade of scent glands uncontrollable. Furthermore, the species is quickly losing suitable habitat. All of the musk deer were spotted on sheltered rocky outcrops around 9,843 feet (3,000 meters) high. In the summer, they regularly trek  along steep slopes that make them almost impossible to approach and keep them  ly safe from hunters. However, heavy snowfall in the winter drives the species farther down, to more human-accessible slopes, and hunters come from all over the country to stalk  the deer for their valuable scent glands. Due to violence and unrest, nongovernmental organizations like the Wildlife Conservation Society have not been able to operate in the Nuristan province since 2010.

Due to violence and unrest, nongovernmental organizations like the Wildlife Conservation Society have not been able to operate in the Nuristan province since 2010.

Haiti was considered to be in crisis long before the earthquake in January. The deputy executive director of UNICEF, Hilde Johnson, says the quake has only made the need for aid more immediate. But she says children all over the world have the right to the same assistance as children everywhere else. The \"Humanitarian Action Report\" discusses several issues that UNICEF says increasingly threaten the basic rights of women and children. It says climate change has caused droughts and food insecurity in many areas. High food prices and the global financial crisis of two thousand eight-two thousand nine have only added to poverty and malnutrition  . And armed conflict continues to threaten the lives of millions. Hilde Johnson says children are always the most affected by conflicts and disasters. They face an increased risk of abuse, including sexual violence and other serious rights violations . UNICEF deals with about two hundred emergencies around the world every year. The greatest need last year was in sub-Saharan Africa. The report says drought, food insecurity and civil unrest affected about twenty-four million people.

They analyzed their different outdoor activities including walking, gardening, cycling, fishing, boating, horse-riding and farming in locations such as a park, garden or nature trail  . They found that the mental health changes were seen after just five minutes. With longer periods of time exercising in a green environment, the positive effects were more apparent.

Researchers from the University of Essex, UK have found that as little as five minutes of a \"green activity\" such as walking, gardening, cycling or farming could help to improve mood and increase self-esteem  . Many studies have shown that outdoor exercise can reduce the risk of mental illness and improve a sense of well-being, but the new study, led by Jules Pretty and Jo Barton, was the first to determine how much time needed to be spent on green exercise for the benefits to show.

What do you read?\" \"I don't know.\" And I didn't. I generally read what was in front of me, what I could get from the paperback stack at the drugstore, what I found at the library, magazines, the back of cereal boxes, comics. The idea of consciously seeking out a special title was new to me, but, I realized, not without appeal--- so I started to look through the piles of books. \"You actually read all of these?\" \"This isn't much,\" Mr. Ballou said. \"This is nothing, just what I've kept, the ones worth looking at a second time.\" \"Pick for me, then.\" He raised his eyebrows, cocked his head, and regarded me as though measuring me for a suit. After a moment, he nodded, searched through a stack, and handed me a dark red hardbound book, fairly thick. \"The Last of the Just,\" I read. \"By Andre Schwarz-Bart. What's it about?\" \"You tell me,\" he said. \"Next week.\" I started after supper, sitting outdoors on an uncomfortable kitchen chair.

This was one of those days, a day when we were on a hike, I became my children's hero. This event happened the first summer after we moved to the mountains of Colorado. Wanting to enjoy the beauty of the mountains, my wife and I planned a day hike to the Brown's Creek waterfall. The kids were excited--a day hike, a chance to experience a waterfall, and a day spent with Dad and Mom. Our hike would take us up the Brown's Creek trail   and after about 3 miles the waterfall would be on our left. After slowly climbing the first mile, the trail took us through a beautiful grassland and across the creek   a couple of times. We decided to turn back before reaching the waterfall, mostly because we were tired and still didn't know how much farther  _ was. While crossing the creek by walking on a downed tree trunk, our little Izzie fell into the creek and immediately started moving up and down in the current  . Immediately, I jumped into the creek after her. I managed to grab her and push her to the bank. But now, I was the one in need of being rescued. I thought this might be the end and I wasn't sure if I could hold on. Then, I heard the voice of the love of my life, my wife's voice. She shouted loudly--Stand up! Stand up! With the last bit of strength I had, I stood, and walked out of the creek. The kids showed little concern for my health; they were looking after Izzie, now safe in their arms.

After senior high school, my education had become very narrow: computer engineering, mathematics, physics, and not much else. Years later, I realized something: I had not memory of ever reading a book for pleasure. But there was a world of knowledge outside science and engineering, and I was tired of being ignorant of it, so I decided I would become a reader. I dived into book after book. In short, the bookworm within me had awakened. Today, I carry a book(if not two or three) with me wherever I go.

The Empire State Building, the White House, New York City and even the American president himself have all been threatened  by terrorist attacks in these exciting films.

Violence has become a major part of Hollywood movies. And this is what people enjoy.

For many years,scientists have warned us that our planet is getting warmer.If current trends continue,animals may start to die off and life could get very difficult for everyone.The temperature is rising because humans have been releasing massive amounts of greenhouse gases into the atmosphere,which surround the planet and keep heat from escaping.One of these gases is carbon dioxide. Most carbon dioxide we produce comes from the process of making and eating food,the scientists reported in Chicago.The production of meat contributes to a lot of carbon dioxide.And much of meat's contribution comes from beef,which is responsible for releasing even more greenhouse gases into the atmosphere. The process of making a hamburger,for example,requires a lot of energy.A cow has to be fed and raised,and cow's wastes are a major source of greenhouse gases.After the cow is killed,the meat has to be processed and shipped to a consumer,which takes fuel.And most of the cow won't even be used for meat people eat. By the time a hamburger finally lands on a dinner plate,it has taken a heavy toll on the environment.It is believed that the process of making a halfpound allbeef burger adds about 19 times the weight of hamburgers in carbon dioxide.

To him, it is an instrument of faith, hope and charity. My mother used to joke, \"Your papa would play his violin if the world was about to blow up.\"  _  In the early years of the 20th century, the boll weevil   began destroying the cotton farms in the southern USA. In May 1910, folks all over the nation were talking about Halley's Comet  . There were all sorts of frightening stories about it, the main one being that the world would pass through its tail, said to be millions of miles long. Between the threats of the comet and weevils, the farmers were running low on optimism. One night, they gathered at our farm to discuss what to do. Will Bowen, a local man, suggested, \"Charley, how about giving us a little music?\" \"I don't think anybody'd want to hear me tonight,\" Dad replied. \"Come on, Mr. Nordyke,\" one of the younger women urged. \"Play for us!\" Dad got the hang of getting people in the mood for his music. He played church songs, and then switched to war songs. By the time he had finished performing, people were stamping their feet, clapping their hands and yelling. All of our neighbors went home whistling. Very few remembered to look to see whether the comet was still around. Another evening, Will Bowen called Dad on the telephone and said, \"Charley, I'm downhearted and blue. Could you play a tune or two for me through the phone?\" Dad handed the receiver to me and then set about playing the songs he had performed that night. I could hear Mr. Bowen whistling and yelling. By the time the tune was finished there were half a dozen neighbors on the line. They talked about how wonderful the music sounded over the telephone. They made numerous requests; I relayed them to Dad and he played. Our broadcasts became regular features of community life. When the weather was bad in winter and farmers were forced to remain in the house, someone would ring us and ask Dad to play. Usually it developed into a network affair. Our phone kept ringing with requests for music until radio came into fashion. All the following statements are FALSE except   _  .", "subject": ""}

Our present concern is with how easily and to what extent this cycle can be modified. The question is no mere academic one. The ease, for example, with which people can change from working in the day to working at night is a question of growing importance in industry where automation calls for round-the-clock working of machines. It normally takes from five days to one week for a person to adapt to a reversed  routine of sleep and wakefulness, sleeping during the day and working at night. Unfortunately, it is often the case in industry that shifts  are changed every week; a person may work from 12 midnight to 8 a.m. one week, 8 a.m. to 4 p.m. the next, and 4 p.m. to 12 midnight the third and so on.

{"answer": 0, "choices": ["Giving examples.", "Cause-effect analysis.", "Comparative analysis.", "Process analysis."], "question": "Psychologists have discovered that even the most independent-minded of us will conform to social pressure when we are with a group of people. In one classie experiment, people were showna vertical line and asked to find a line of identical length from a selection of three. You might think that this is an absurdly easy task, and when people perform it by themselves they do it very well. However, psychologists have discovered that we are very easily swayed by the opinions of other people when we do this task in a group. In one study, a group of three people was set up,where two of the people were confederates of the experimenter.When the confederates deliberately gave wrong answers,people were often swayed to give the wrong answer also. In fact, 75% of people gave at least one wrong answer, with some people conforming to peer pressure on every occasion. But why do people conform in this way?  In an easy task like this,  it seems that people do not want to step out of line with the prevailing opinion of the group. On more difficult tasks, people also conform because they lose onfidence in their own ability to make decisions and prefer to trust the majority opinion instead. A typical example of this kind of conformity arises when we come across people in distress. Would you help a woman who has been attacked in the street?It turns out that you are much more likely to go to her assistance if you are alone.When other people are also around,a diffusion of responsibility occurs. People are paralysed into inaction, because everyone assumes that someone else will go to the woman' s assistance. What method does the author mainly use to develop the text?", "subject": ""}

And every year her husband sent them, tied with pretty bows. The year he died, the roses were delivered to her door. The card said, \"Be my Valentine \" , like all the years before. Each year he sent her roses, and the note would always say, \"I love you even more this year, than last year on this day. My love for you will always grow, with every passing year.\" She knew this was the last time that the roses would appear. She thought, he ordered roses in advance before this day.

She would sit for hours in her husband's favorite chair, staring at his photo and the roses sitting there. A year went by, and it was hard to live without her mate. Loneliness and solitude had become her fate. Then, the very hour, as on Valentine's Day before, the doorbell rang, and there were roses, sitting by her door. She brought the roses in, and just looked at them in shock. Then, she went to get the telephone to call the florist shop. The owner answered, and she asked him, if he would explain why someone would do this to her, causing her such pain. \"I know your husband passed away, more than a year ago,\" the owner said, \"I knew you'd call, and you would want to know. The flowers you received today were paid for in advance. Your husband always planned ahead. He left nothing to chance.\" \"There is a standing order that I have on file down here. And he has paid, well in advance; you'll get them every year. There is also another thing that I think you should know. He wrote a special little card ... he did this years ago.\" \"Then, should ever, I find out that he's no longer here. That's the card ... that should be sent to you the following year.\" She thanked him and hung up the phone ,her tears now flowing hard. Her fingers shaking, she slowly reached to get the card. Inside the card, she saw that he had written her a note.  Then,as she stared in total silence, this is what he wrote: \"Hello my love, I know it's been a year since I was gone. I hope it hasn't been too hard for you to overcome. I know it must be lonely, and the pain is very real. If it was the other way, I know how I would feel. The love we shared made everything so beautiful in life. I loved you more than words can say. You were the perfect wife.\" \"You were my friend and lover; you satisfied my every need. I know it's only been a year, but please try not to grieve. I want you to be happy, even when you shed your tears. That is why the roses will be sent to you for years.\" \"When you get these roses, think of all the happiness that we had together, and how both of us were blessed. I have always loved you and I know I always will. But, my love, you must go on; you have some living still.\" \"Please ... try to find happiness, while living out your days. I know it is not easy, but I hope you find some ways. The roses will come every year, and they will only stop when your door's not answered, when the florist stops to knock. He will come five times that day, in case you have gone out. But after his last visit, he will know without a doubt. To take the roses to the place, where I've instructed him, and place them where we are, together once again.\" Which of the following is the best title for the passage?", "subject": ""}

As they went along, they saw a pair of old shoes lying in the path. They were a poor farmer's, who was working in the nearby field. The student turned to the teacher, saying: \"we will hide his shoes, and hide ourselves behind those trees, and wait to see what he will do.\" \"My young friend,\" answered the teacher, \"we should never make fun of the poor. Why not put a coin in each shoe, and then we will hide ourselves and watch?\" The student did so and they both hid themselves behind the trees.

If men insisted on being free from the burden of self-dependence and responsibility for the common good, they would cease to be free. Responsibility is the price every man must pay for freedom. It is to be had on no other terms. Athens, the Athens of Ancient Greece, refused responsibility; she reached the end of freedom and was never to have it again. But, \"the excellent becomes the permanent\", Aristotle said. Athens lost freedom forever, but freedom was not lost forever for the world. A great American, James Madison, referred to: \"The capacity   of mankind for self-government.\" No doubt he had not an idea that he was speaking Greek. Athens was not in the farthest background of his mind, but once man has a great and good idea, it is never completely lost. The Digital Age cannot destroy it. Somehow in this or that man's thought such an idea lives though unconsidered by the world of action. One can never be sure that it is not on the point of breaking out into action only sure that it will do so sometime. What is the author's understanding of freedom?", "subject": ""}

They have traveled to Montpelier Farms in Prince George's County which is also in Maryland. The farm is about 40 kilometers from The White House. Debbie Pierson is the student's teacher. \"We go on these kind of field trips so that the children will have a hands-on experience of what it's like to be on a farm,\" Pierson said. In Loudoun County Virginia, there are farms where grapes are grown for use in making wine. Many of the farms let people visit, and drink the wine that is made there. Bill Hatch owns the Zephaniah Farm Vineyard. He holds wine tastings in his home. \"We are doubling the number of visitors to our farm every year. We have an average of 250 people on a weekend,\" Hatch said. As more people visit farms, more farmers are adding activities in which visitors can take part. Malcolm Baldwin owns WeatherLea Farm and Vineyard in Loudoun County. Six years ago, he began letting people be married at his farm. They can also sleep at the farm overnight. Mr. Baldwin says the money he makes from these activities let him keep his small farm operating. \"But without the animals, and without the vines, the wedding business wouldn't be as profitable  , because people like to see the vines.

Only 174 survived, including 22 of the 29 crew members. The sinking left more than 260 people dead with about 40 others still missing. On Tuesday, one ordinary diver died at a hospital, government spokesman Ko Myung-seok said. He is the first death among divers organized following the ferry's sinking, according to the coast guard. The 53-year-old diver was pulled to the surface by his teammates after losing communication about five minutes after he began underwater searches, Ko said. It was his first search attempt, Ko added. Despite his death, divers are continuing their searches for the remaining missing people. Ko said that divers had searched all those 64 areas at least once and plan to visit them again to look for more victims. Darkness, floating rubbish, bodies, and cabins on board have made the search difficult, and divers entered the last three unopened areas on Monday night, Ko said. Investigators have made their first arrests of people who were not on board the Sewol when it sank. The three people arrested on Friday and Sunday are accused of failure to handle of cargo on the ferry well. In all, 19 people have been arrested in the investigation , 15 of whom were crew members accused of abandoning passengers. A leader was arrested on suspicion of malpractice  related to company finances. Improper stowage  and overloading of cargo is suspected as a possible reason why the ferry sank. The ferry was carrying about 3,608 tons of cargo, more than three times what it could safely carry. A ferry loaded too heavily could lose its balance making even a small turn. The sinking has caused a national sadness. On Sunday 1.1 million people paid respects at 131 memorial sites around the nation, according to a governmental funeral support committee set up for the ferry victims. Monday was a holiday for Children's Day, but various events were canceled or put off because of the ferry's sinking.

They will live there for about a year, and then will be replaced with another group of pioneers. Building the base on Mars will advance our knowledge of the solar system and aid in our understanding of the earth. We already know that Mars resembles the earth in many aspects: general size, presence of water, length of day, range of temperatures. These resemblances have caused many people to consider a centuries-long project: to terraform Mars. Terraforming means _ a planet's surface so that Earth's life forms can survive there. This concept, previously found only in science fiction is now being seriously considered by scientists. Terraforming Mars is theoretically simple: add nitrogen and oxygen to the atmosphere; pump water to the surface; and add the earth's plants and animals in the order in which they developed on Earth. But it will take at least 300 years. Some people think that such a project is too huge for humans to undertake, but there are very good reasons to make the attempt. The earth now contains some 6 billion people, and no one has any idea of how many humans the earth can support. Our very existence and numbers are threatening many other species. We also have had some experience with terraforming our own planet: altering the landscape, the atmosphere and the climate. Currently terraforming earth has become a wiser activity as we try to control global warming, air and water pollution, and preserve some natural living places. While the possibility of such a project is small, it is not impossible .Even if earth -bound societies come and go in the next 300 years, the project can continue through the work of the Mars settlers without the need for constant backing from the earth.

These resemblances have caused many people to consider a centuries-long project: to terraform Mars. Terraforming means _ a planet's surface so that Earth's life forms can survive there. This concept, previously found only in science fiction is now being seriously considered by scientists. Terraforming Mars is theoretically simple: add nitrogen and oxygen to the atmosphere; pump water to the surface; and add the earth's plants and animals in the order in which they developed on Earth. But it will take at least 300 years. Some people think that such a project is too huge for humans to undertake, but there are very good reasons to make the attempt. The earth now contains some 6 billion people, and no one has any idea of how many humans the earth can support. Our very existence and numbers are threatening many other species. We also have had some experience with terraforming our own planet: altering the landscape, the atmosphere and the climate. Currently terraforming earth has become a wiser activity as we try to control global warming, air and water pollution, and preserve some natural living places. While the possibility of such a project is small, it is not impossible .Even if earth -bound societies come and go in the next 300 years, the project can continue through the work of the Mars settlers without the need for constant backing from the earth. The future existence of all the people in our world may very well depend upon our ability to terraform Mars. What's the author's attitude towards the project?", "subject": ""}

Caffeine is known to have many positive and negative consequences, and now that there might be an additional positive effect may have been discovered. A study suggests that a skin lotion   containing caffeine, which is also found in green tea, may reduce the risk of skin cancer. Two lotion tests were conducted on hairless mice that were exposed to high levels of ultraviolet radiation  . As a result, the lotion reduced the number of tumors   each mouse developed. Unlike sunscreen  , the new lotion is applied after exposure to the ultraviolet rays. Rays from the sun can cause genetic changes in the skin that can lead to skin cancer. Caffeine obstructs this action and causes the diseased cells to kill themselves. \"I know that caffeine has been found in certain drinks and it causes increased activity of the nervous system, and increased blood pressure on blood vessels  . I don't know of any positive effects of caffeine,\" health teacher Montego Estes said. Caffeine, found commonly in tea, coffee and soft drinks, provides people with an increase in energy.

They moved in after big success in the textile industry and aided a substantial textile industry in Hilversum. But the textile boom lasted only several decades. The last factory closed in the 1960s. The change to a media economy started in 1920, when the Nederlandse Seintoestedllen Fabriek (NSF) established a radio factory in Hiversum.

We lived miles from town and I rarely saw my own friends outside of school. I heard my brothers laughing from inside the house and felt a single tear coming down my cheek. At that moment I saw a large brown dog walking over to me. He looked happy and his tail was wagging as well. Even though he didn't know me he greeted me like a long lost friend, licking my chin and sitting beside me on the spring grass. It must have been at least an hour that I petted and talked to this four-legged angel.

Today, however, the book has a different reputation, owing to the popular image of its character, Uncle Tom-whose name has become a saying for a cowardly black man who betrays his race. But this view is wrong: The original Uncle Tom was physically and morally strong, an inspiration for blacks and other oppressed people worldwide. Indeed, that's why in the mid-19th century Southerners attacked \"Uncle Tom's Cabin\" as a dangerously destructive book, while Northern reformers-especially blacks-often praised it. The book was influential overseas, too.In Russia it inspired Vladimir Lenin, who recalled it as his favorite book in childhood. It was the first American novel to be translated and published in China, and it fueled antislavery causes in Cuba and Brazil. The book's progressive appeal was the character of Uncle Tom himself: a strong man who is notable because he does not betray his race; one reason he gave up escaping from his plantation is that he doesn't want to put his fellow slaves in danger. And he is finally killed because he refuses to tell his master where two runaway slaves are hiding. Unfortunately, these themes were lost in many of the stage versions of \"Uncle Tom's Cabin\".

Indeed, that's why in the mid-19th century Southerners attacked \"Uncle Tom's Cabin\" as a dangerously destructive book, while Northern reformers-especially blacks-often praised it. The book was influential overseas, too.In Russia it inspired Vladimir Lenin, who recalled it as his favorite book in childhood. It was the first American novel to be translated and published in China, and it fueled antislavery causes in Cuba and Brazil. The book's progressive appeal was the character of Uncle Tom himself: a strong man who is notable because he does not betray his race; one reason he gave up escaping from his plantation is that he doesn't want to put his fellow slaves in danger. And he is finally killed because he refuses to tell his master where two runaway slaves are hiding. Unfortunately, these themes were lost in many of the stage versions of \"Uncle Tom's Cabin\". The play, seen by more people than those who read the book, remained popular up to the`1950s and still appears occasionally. But in the play Stowe's revolutionary themes were drowned. But it doesn't have to be that way; indeed, during the civil rights era it was those who most closely resembled Uncle Tom-Stowe's Tom, not the sheepish one of popular myth-who proved most effective in promoting progress. Both Stowe and Tom deserve our reconsideration and our respect. According to the passage, which of the following is NOT true?", "subject": ""}

Another good thing about mistakes is this: When you are making mistakes, you are learning. Consider this: Edison failed 10,000 times before he perfected the light bulb. When asked how it felt to fail that many times, he said that he hadn't failed 10,000 times, but rather had learned 10,000 things that didn't work. Finally, when you make a mistake you are much closer to success. Why? Because when all is said and done, you will have tried some number of things before you succeeded. Every time you make a mistake you _ one of those things and are one step closer. But this all doesn't mean that you should go ahead without considering the consequences of a mistake. Quite the contrary, when you try something new you have to be willing to set some reasonable limits so that in the event that it doesn't work out the way you want it to, you will be in a position to try again. We all have limited resources in the form of time and money so don't blow them all on one approach to a problem. Realize that it probably won't be perfect the first time and allocate   these resources appropriately so you can learn, make corrections, and try it again. Only by accepting and using your mistakes in this way can you make significant advances in your business and your career.

He was born in Omaha Nebraska in 1924. He was named after his father, a salesman. His mother, Dorothy, was an actress in the local theater. Marlon Brando moved to New York City when he was 19 years old in 1943. He took acting classes at the New School for Social Research. One of his teachers was Stella Adler, who taught the \"Method\" style of realistic acting. The Method teaches actors how to use their own memories and emotions to identify with the characters they are playing. Marlon Brando learned the Method style quickly and easily. Critics said he was probably the greatest Method actor ever. One famous actress commented on his natural ability for it. She said teaching Marlon Brando the Method was like sending a tiger to jungle school. Marlon Brando appeared in several plays. He got his first major part in a Broadway play in 1947, at the age of 23. He received great praise for his powerful performance at Stanley Kowalski in Tennessee Williams' play, A Streetcar Named Desire. His fame grew when he acted the same part in the movie version, released in 1951. Marlon Brando won the Best Actor Oscar for The God Father, but he rejected it. He sent a woman named Sasheen Littlefeather to speak for him at the Academy Awards ceremony. She said that Brando could not accept the award because of the way the American film industry treated Native Americans. The people at the Academy Awards ceremony did not like the speech. But some experts think the action helped change the way American Indians were shown in movies. Marlon Brando acted in about forty movies. He was nominated for a total of eight Academy Awards. But he earned a \"bad boy\" reputation for his public outbursts and unusual behaviours. According to Los Angeles magazine, \"Brando was rock and roll before anybody knew what rock and roll was\". His later life was marked with family tragedies. His son Christian went to prison for killing his daughter Cheyene's boyfriend. Cheyene later committed suicide. Brando became lonely.

The number of students doing so has increased 2 percent annually in recent years, according to the Department of Education.          In 2009, Jessica Fuller, then 25, was employed at a small private university in Philadelphia as a clerk in an office. Bored with her job and becoming increasingly interested in healthcare industry, Fuller knew she would need a master's degree in public health for her dream career.          At first, Fuller wanted a school in New York and Pennsylvania, but with many programs costing over $30,000 per year for tuition alone, she decided on an option she could better afford ---- the Netherlands. A similar degree in health economics cost less than $ 17,000 for a one-year program.          To finance her education at Erasmus University in Rotterdam, Fuller took out a $30,000 bank loan through her mother's credit, which covered tuition and fees, as well as air travel and living expenses for her year abroad.           The cost may be lower, but is the quality of education overseas just as good as an American university? Jessica Fuller says in her case, yes: she found a consulting job with Marsh Inc. as an International Knowledge Manager shortly after she graduated from Erasmus University, and says that the university ---and its location---- were definitely a factor.          \"Many Erasmus professors were world famous experts in their fields,\" says Fuller. \"Considering the variety of the students, the class discussions were very robust.

A blog differs from a traditional website in several ways. Most importantly, it is updated   much more regularly. Many blogs are updated every day, and some are updated several times a day. Also, most blogs use special software or websites, which can help ordinary people easily set up and start writing their own blogs.               There are many different kinds of blogs. The most popular type is an online diary of links where the blog writer surfs the Internet and then posts links to sites or news articles that they find interesting, with a few comments about each one. Other types are personal diaries, where the writer talks about their life and feelings. Sometimes these blogs can be very personal.               There is another kind of blogging, called \"moblogging\", short for \"mobile blogging\". Mobloggers use mobile phones with cameras to take photos, which are posted instantly to the Internet. The use of mobile phones in this way made the headlines   in Singapore when a high school student posted a movie he had taken of a teacher shouting at another student on the Internet. Many people were shocked by what the student did, and wanted phones with cameras to be banned from schools.               Many people think that as blogs become common, news reporting will rely less on big media companies, and more on ordinary people posting news to the Internet. They think that then the news will be less like a lecture, and more like a conversation, where any one can join in.

Shelli lost so much blood that her heart couldn't function properly and she went into shock at the hospital. Physicians were able to make her come to herself.

She had shown heart failure and lung failure. \"I thought every heartbeat would be her last,\" Stephen says. As days passed with no change, one doctor gently asked if it was time to let Shelli go. An MRI showed her brain didn't have much chance of supporting life. Stephen couldn't bear the thought of trapping his wife's beautiful spirit in a body that would never work. If he kept her alive, what kind of life would she have ? He called family, religious leaders, and physician friends in Utah for guidance. And he decided there still was a chance. The family moved Shelli to a Utah hospital closer to home. In the next few weeks she started opening her eyes, but it wasn't entirely clear how conscious she was. Nearly seven weeks after the accident, Stephen was joking with his sister in the hospital room when he saw Shelli smile, a big toothy grin. \"Did you understand that?\" he asked. She smiled again. Stephen fell to his knees in thanks. Shelli's recovery has been slow but steady. Initially, she couldn't remember much of the previous months, including her own wedding. Shelli has endured 17 operations so far and may require more surgery. She will definitely need more months of recovery. But she is able to walk. \"She's got her life back. She's able to love and be loved, and be the person she was.\" Elovie says. When Shelli hears about each step in her recovery, she calls it \"miracle after miracle\". As for his experience, Stephen says, \"This is a story of fear that was slowly replaced by faith.\" . After reading the passage, what impresses us most may be that.", "subject": ""}

These cave systems form in carbonate rock, often on islands. Some blue holes have very special rock formations and water chemistry. Far below sea level, they contain some of the harshest environments on Earth, with no oxygen and no light. Yet these areas are filled with life forms that have adapted to the extreme conditions. Information gathered from these blue holes is helping scientists to increase their understanding of biology, archaeology and geology. But exploring these blue hole environments brings danger as well as discovery.  Blue holes get their name from the color1 some have when seen from the air. The color1 is usually a reflection of the sky on the water. But not all of these cave systems have blue surfaces. Some contain dark or muddy water. Blue holes are the result of erosion in which water breaks down rock. Rain falling thousands of years ago contained chemicals which slowly wore away at the limestone landmass. These holes were later filled with sea water as the sea level changed. The rising and falling of sea levels and the mixture of salt and fresh water further wore away at these cave formations. Blue holes are vertical caves. But they can also have horizontal cave formations that may be hundreds of meters long.  These flooded cave systems can be found in the ocean, or they can be found inland. Ocean caves are affected by tides, so they always have water movement. But blue holes on land are very still. They have several layers of water, chemicals, and bacteria. The top layer of fresh water comes from rainfall. This layer acts like a cap on top of the layered mixture, and keeps out oxygen from the atmosphere. The fresh water floats on a denser layer of saltwater. Underneath this is a layer of poisonous hydrogen sulfide, produced by bacteria living in the water. Underneath this layer is anoxic seawater -- water that does not contain any oxygen.  Underwater caves are probably one of the least explored ecosystems on the planet. One reason blue holes have not been fully explored is that they can be extremely dangerous.

{"answer": 2, "choices": ["You might lose all your friends.", "You will lose both health and wealth.", "You perhaps be given more responsibility.", "You may be misunderstood by your loved ones."], "question": "Work-life balance: Ways to restore harmony and reduce stress Finding work-life balance in today's frenetically paced world is no simple task. Spend more time at work than at home, and you miss out on a rewarding personal life. Then again, when you face challenges in your personal life, such as caring for an aging parent or coping with marital problems, concentrating on your job can be difficult. Whether the problem is too much focus on work or too little, when your work life and your personal life feel out of balance, stress -- along with its harmful effects -- is the result. The good news is that you can take control of your work-life balance -- and give yourself the time to do the things that are most important to you. The first step is to recognize how the world of work has changed. Then you can evaluate your relationship to work and apply some specific strategies for striking a healthier balance. How work invades your personal life There was a time when employees showed up for work Monday through Friday and worked eight- to nine-hour days. The boundaries between work and home were fairly clear then. But the world has changed and, unfortunately, the boundaries have blurred for many workers. Here's why: *Global economy. As more skilled workers enter the global labor market and companies outsource or move more jobs to reduce labor costs, people feel pressured to work longer and produce more just to protect their jobs. *International business. Work continues around the world 24 hours a day for some people. If you work in an international organization, you might be on call around the clock for troubleshooting or consulting. *Advanced communication technology. Many people now have the ability to work anywhere -- from their home, from their car and even on vacation. And some managers expect this. *Longer hours. Employers commonly ask employees to work longer hours than they're scheduled. Often, overtime is mandatory. If you hope to move up the career ladder, you may find yourself regularly working more than 40 hours a week to achieve and exceed expectations. *Changes in family roles. Today's married worker is typically part of a dual-career couple, which makes it difficult to find time to meet commitments to family, friends and community. Married to your work It can be tempting to rack up the hours at work -- especially if you're trying to earn a promotion or some extra money for a child's education or a dream vacation. For others, working more hours feels necessary in order to manage the workload. But if you're spending most of your time at work, your home life will likely pay the price. Consider the pros and cons of working extra hours on your work-life balance: *Fatigue. Your ability to think and your eye-hand coordination decrease when you're tired. This means you're less productive and may make more mistakes. These mistakes can lead to injury or rework and negatively impact your professional reputation. *Family. You may miss out on important events, such as your child's first bike ride, your father's 60th birthday or your high-school reunion. Missing out on important milestones may harm relationships with your loved ones. *Friends. Trusted friends are a key part of your support system. But if you're spending time at the office instead of with them, you'll find it difficult to nurture those friendships. *Expectations. If you regularly work extra hours, you may be given more responsibility. This could create a never-ending and increasing cycle, causing more concerns and challenges. Sometimes working overtime is important. If you work for a company that requires mandatory overtime, you won't be able to avoid it, but you can learn to manage it. Most importantly, say no when you're too tired, when it's affecting your health or when you have crucial family obligations. Striking the best work-life balance  _ With so many demands on your time -- from overtime to family obligations -- it can feel difficult to strike this balance. The goal is to make time for the activities that are the most important to you. Here are some ideas to help you find the balance that's best for you: *Learn to say no. Whether it's a co-worker asking you to spearhead an extra project or your child's teacher asking you to manage the class play, remember that it's OK to respectfully say no. When you quit doing the things you only do out of guilt or a false sense of obligation, you'll make more room in your life for the activities that are meaningful to you and bring you joy. *Leave work at work. Make a conscious decision to separate work time from personal time. When with your family, for instance, turn off your cell phone and put away your laptop computer. *Manage your time. Organize household tasks efficiently. Do one or two loads of laundry every day, rather than saving it all for your day off. A weekly family calendar of important dates and a daily list of to-dos will help you avoid deadline panic. If your employer offers a course in time management, sign up for it. *Get enough sleep. There's nothing as stressful and potentially dangerous as working when you're sleep-deprived. Not only is your productivity affected, but also you can make costly mistakes. You may then have to work even more hours to make up for these mistakes. *Communicate clearly. Limit time-consuming misunderstandings by communicating clearly and listening carefully. Take notes if necessary. *Nurture yourself. Set aside time each day for an activity that you enjoy, such as walking, working out or listening to music. *Set aside one night each week for recreation. Take the phone off the hook, power down the computer and turn off the TV. Discover activities you can do with your partner, family or friends, such as playing golf, fishing or canoeing. Making time for activities you enjoy will rejuvenate you. Remember, striking a work-life balance isn't a one-shot deal. Creating balance in your life is a continuous process. Balance doesn't mean doing everything. Examine your priorities and set boundaries. Be firm in what you can and cannot do. Only you can restore harmony to your lifestyle.

Whether the problem is too much focus on work or too little, when your work life and your personal life feel out of balance, stress -- along with its harmful effects -- is the result. The good news is that you can take control of your work-life balance -- and give yourself the time to do the things that are most important to you. The first step is to recognize how the world of work has changed. Then you can evaluate your relationship to work and apply some specific strategies for striking a healthier balance. How work invades your personal life There was a time when employees showed up for work Monday through Friday and worked eight- to nine-hour days. The boundaries between work and home were fairly clear then. But the world has changed and, unfortunately, the boundaries have blurred for many workers. Here's why: *Global economy. As more skilled workers enter the global labor market and companies outsource or move more jobs to reduce labor costs, people feel pressured to work longer and produce more just to protect their jobs. *International business. Work continues around the world 24 hours a day for some people. If you work in an international organization, you might be on call around the clock for troubleshooting or consulting. *Advanced communication technology. Many people now have the ability to work anywhere -- from their home, from their car and even on vacation. And some managers expect this. *Longer hours. Employers commonly ask employees to work longer hours than they're scheduled. Often, overtime is mandatory. If you hope to move up the career ladder, you may find yourself regularly working more than 40 hours a week to achieve and exceed expectations. *Changes in family roles. Today's married worker is typically part of a dual-career couple, which makes it difficult to find time to meet commitments to family, friends and community. Married to your work It can be tempting to rack up the hours at work -- especially if you're trying to earn a promotion or some extra money for a child's education or a dream vacation. For others, working more hours feels necessary in order to manage the workload. But if you're spending most of your time at work, your home life will likely pay the price. Consider the pros and cons of working extra hours on your work-life balance: *Fatigue. Your ability to think and your eye-hand coordination decrease when you're tired. This means you're less productive and may make more mistakes. These mistakes can lead to injury or rework and negatively impact your professional reputation. *Family. You may miss out on important events, such as your child's first bike ride, your father's 60th birthday or your high-school reunion. Missing out on important milestones may harm relationships with your loved ones. *Friends. Trusted friends are a key part of your support system. But if you're spending time at the office instead of with them, you'll find it difficult to nurture those friendships. *Expectations. If you regularly work extra hours, you may be given more responsibility. This could create a never-ending and increasing cycle, causing more concerns and challenges. Sometimes working overtime is important. If you work for a company that requires mandatory overtime, you won't be able to avoid it, but you can learn to manage it. Most importantly, say no when you're too tired, when it's affecting your health or when you have crucial family obligations. Striking the best work-life balance  _ With so many demands on your time -- from overtime to family obligations -- it can feel difficult to strike this balance. The goal is to make time for the activities that are the most important to you. Here are some ideas to help you find the balance that's best for you: *Learn to say no. Whether it's a co-worker asking you to spearhead an extra project or your child's teacher asking you to manage the class play, remember that it's OK to respectfully say no. When you quit doing the things you only do out of guilt or a false sense of obligation, you'll make more room in your life for the activities that are meaningful to you and bring you joy. *Leave work at work. Make a conscious decision to separate work time from personal time. When with your family, for instance, turn off your cell phone and put away your laptop computer. *Manage your time. Organize household tasks efficiently. Do one or two loads of laundry every day, rather than saving it all for your day off. A weekly family calendar of important dates and a daily list of to-dos will help you avoid deadline panic. If your employer offers a course in time management, sign up for it. *Get enough sleep. There's nothing as stressful and potentially dangerous as working when you're sleep-deprived. Not only is your productivity affected, but also you can make costly mistakes. You may then have to work even more hours to make up for these mistakes. *Communicate clearly. Limit time-consuming misunderstandings by communicating clearly and listening carefully. Take notes if necessary. *Nurture yourself. Set aside time each day for an activity that you enjoy, such as walking, working out or listening to music. *Set aside one night each week for recreation. Take the phone off the hook, power down the computer and turn off the TV. Discover activities you can do with your partner, family or friends, such as playing golf, fishing or canoeing. Making time for activities you enjoy will rejuvenate you. Remember, striking a work-life balance isn't a one-shot deal. Creating balance in your life is a continuous process.

But just a few days ago, it took the life of a pop singer in China. Wang Bei, 24, a former singer on Super Girl, died on Nov 15 during plastic surgery in Wuhan, Hubei province. The young singer's jaw suddenly started bleeding during the procedure, blocking her throat and causing her to suffocate. The Ministry of Health stepped in on Nov 27, calling on health authorities all over China to increase supervision of the country's medical plastic surgery industry. It also told the Hubei health department to look into Wang's death and \"to make the results of the investigation public as soon as possible\" Wang's death has raised concerns about the dangers of plastic surgery in China. In China, people, especially youngsters, are becoming more and more conscious of their looks and are willing to _ to make themselves look more attractive.

From Nyhavan, I continued heading north. I wanted to see Copenhagen's symbol, the statue of the Little Mermaid  . She was set up in honor of Hans Christian Andersen's famous story. As I continued my city tour, one thing impressed me all the bicycles. I learned that half the population of Copenhagen rides bikes every day. Only 20 percent of Copenhageners own cars because there is a 180 percent tax on them. That certainly keeps the city free of traffic jams and heavy pollution! It's easy to join all the bicyclists pedaling   through the streets, too. The city provides free bicycles that anyone can use. The cycling around the castles and parks made a relaxing end to a full day. As darkness fell and the parks' lights began to twinkle, I watched families enjoying themselves.

Who would feed him, shelter him, and carry him down the road? The idea interested me. So I decided to travel from the Pacific to the Atlantic without a penny. It would be a cashless journey through the land of the almighty dollar. I would only accept offers of rides, food and a place to rest my head.

His achievements show that we can all achieve great things--no matter who we are. Philippe Croizon was 26 years old when he had an accident. The doctors had to remove both of his arms and legs. \"When they cut off my last leg I wanted to die. I suffered great depression and my spirit was as low as you can get. But you have to choose--and I chose to live!\" said Croizon. While he was recovering in hospital, Croizon saw a television programme about a woman who had been swimming across the English Channel. After watching the programme Croizon decided to do it. He began to exercise every day to make him strong and it took him two years to prepare. Finally in 2010, Croizon was ready. He entered the cold, grey sea of the English Channel. He was now 42 years old. It took him from early morning until night to swim the distance. He felt a lot of pain. But he had become the first person without arms and legs to swim between France and England. Croizon had achieved his dream, but he did not stop there. He looked for a new goal. Early in 2012 he planned to swim across the seas that join five major continents. During the next few months he swam between the four continents of Australia, Asia, Africa and Europe and finally in the cold waters of the Bering Strait between the continents of Asia and the Americas. \"We want to show people something. If disabled people have courage and a lot of training they can do the same things as those who are not disabled,\" said Croizon. What's the best title for the passage?", "subject": ""}

For decades, experts have worried about the effect on young viewers of the violence and sexual content in some TV programs, movies and video games. Another issue is that kids are spending time sitting on a couch  watching TV or playing computer games when they could be running around outside.  One study found that children who spend more than eight hours watching TV per week at age 3 are more likely to be overweight at 7. And research showed that many USchildren watch far more.

They are dying because they are losing a great deal of habitat due to human incursion and global warming.  They are dying because of starvation as well.  With the sea ice they depend on for survival shrinking, it is becoming increasingly difficult for them to find food. An ecosystem is highly dependent on all of its parts, and removing even a single species can result in serious consequences.  Polar bears are at the top of the predators where they live.  They play an important part in the ecosystem.  They feed on seals, fish and deer.  Several other animals depend on the kill of polar bears.  The failure to save polar bears might result in loss of these predators. In addition, all large predators perform a very important function in their habitat: helping to control the populations of other species.  When an animal group loses its natural predators, its population will rise rapidly, having a direct result in population decrease of other groups.  A huge boom in population of Arctic seals would have a direct effect on the prey  of seals, and could reduce numbers of certain types of fish. This could also have a direct effect on humans, who might have to compete with Arctic seals for food supplies from fish. Lack of polar bears could eventually affect human food supply. Human beings shall save polar bears to ensure the food supply. There is no doubt that we should save polar bears.  However, there is still another question: can they be saved? This is a matter that scientists debate because of rapid degradation of the polar bear' environment in recent years due to warming temperatures.

Also, fewer people are dying from TB. But a study by researchers at the University of California, San Francisco, says smoking could threaten this progress. Nearly twenty percent of all people use tobacco, and millions of non-smokers get sick from breathing the smoke. The new study predicts that smoking will produce an additional thirty-four million TB deaths by 2024. Efforts to control the spread of TB have mainly focused on finding and treating infections. Fewer efforts have been made to understand the causes. Dr Anthony Fauci is the director of the United States National Institute of Allergy and Infectious diseases. He said, \"Despite our control efforts, we still have more than a million people each year dying from TB and millions of people  getting infected; we realize it's still a very important problem. So we have to do the practical thing and we have to do the fundamental research things at the same time. \" Smoking does not cause TB; bacteria cause the infection. But the study says smoking affects the nervous system in a way that makes an inactive case of TB more likely to develop into an active one. Stanton Glantz is the director of the University of California's Centre for Tobacco Control Research and Education and an author of the new study. He says it shows that TB cannot be controlled unless tobacco use is controlled.  He said, \"It increases the number of people who will get TB by about seven percent.\" The study is described as the first to identify a direct link between tobacco use and rates of TB infection and death.

However, just one week into that trip, I realized that  tbree months of travel simply wasn't enough. The only problem was that I had less than $1,500 to my name. Fast forward lo today... Over the past 15 years, 1 have discovered, and taken advantage of, endless opportunities that have allowed me to continuously live, travel, study and earn money in over 85 countries. The point is, if I can make it happen with $1,500 and no idea what I was doing, you can  make it happen as well. And with the knowledge and experience I'm  about to pass on to you in this guide , you're  going to have a much easier path ahead than I ever did! If you are constantly wondering how you can possibly achieve all of your travel goals during this lifetime, I just want to repeat everything you, re dreaming about really can be achieved. It'll take some haixl work and determination for sure, but when you find yourself living or  traveling or working overseas, enjoying rewarding experiences, you'11 be thankful that you  decided to choose a life of travel. And I honestly  can't wait to meet up with you in some foreign land where we can swap travel stories over a beer or coffee or tea! How does the author sound when writing the passage?", "subject": ""}

A US Coast Guard cutter poured cannon fire into an abandoned Japanese ghost ship that had been drifting since last year's tsunami  , sinking the vessel into waters more than 305 meters deep in the Gulf of Alaska and removing the danger it posed to shipping and the coastline on Thursday. The cutter's guns tore holes in the 164-foot Ryou-Un Maru, and then it began to take on water and lean to one side. In about four hours, the ship disappeared into the sea, said Chief Petty Officer Kip Wadlow. The ship had no lights or communications system, and its tank was able to carry more than 7,570 liters of diesel fuel. Officials, however, didn't know exactly how much fuel was aboard. \"It's less risky than it would be running into shore or running into other ships,\" coast guard spokesman Paul Webb said.

But there is no day that you may not visit the South Rim and find the sun warm on your face and the air perfumed with the incense   of smoke from an Indian hearth  .

{"answer": 0, "choices": ["Because his family was badly off at that time.", "Because he liked his job more than studying.", "Because he wanted to be an actor in London.", "Because he wanted to open his own company."], "question": "Shakespeare's life can be divided into three periods: the first 20 years in Stratford, which includes his schooling,early marriage, and fatherhood;the next 25 years as an actor and playwright   in London; and the last five in retirement back in Stratford where he enjoyed the wealth gained from his theatrical   successes. The years linking the first two periods are marked by a lack of information about Shakespeare, and are often referred to as the \"dark years\". Shakespeare probably left school at 15, and took some sorts of jobs, especially since this was the period of his father's financial difficulty. A great number of references in his plays suggest that William may have in fact worked for his father, thus gaining specialized knowledge. At some point during the \"dark years\", Shakespeare began his career with a London theatrical company -- perhaps in 1589 -- for he was already an actor and playwright in 1592. Shakespeare apparently wrote and acted for Pembroke's Men, as well as a lot of others, in particular Strange's Men, which later became the Chamberlain's Men. When, in 1592, the theaters were closed for about two years, due to a terrible disease. Shakespeare turned to writing book-length poetry. Most _ were Venus and Adonis and The Rape of Lucrece, both of which have been translated into many languages and even been included in students' textbooks. During this same period, Shakespeare was writing his sonnets  , which are more likely signs of the time's fashion rather than actual love poems detailing any particular relationship. He returned to play writing when theater reopened in 1594, and published no more poetry. His sonnets were published without his permission in 1609, shortly before his retirement. His final play was Henry VIII, two years before his death in 1616. Why did Shakespeare take some sorts of jobs at the age of 15 and didn't go on studying?", "subject": ""}
