A plan to fine students up to $75 for each day they skip school is now being considered by New Britain authorities. The concept of fining kids for skipping school may come as a shock, but it's not new. In Ohio, the parents responsible for a student guilty of habitual truancy can be fined up to $500 and/or be required to perform up to 70 hours of community service. Until recently, students in Los Angeles could be hit with a $250 punishment for each count of truancy; in early 2012 the law was changed and the heavy fines were removed, though a $20 punishment may still be handed out if a student truants for the third time. Fines for truancy are also in effect overseas. In the UK, The Guardian reports, parents can be fined PS50 (about $80) per skipped school day. The punishment doubles if it's not paid within 28 days. The question is: Do fines like this work? The vast majority of authorities in the UK said that, indeed, they do. The fines were believed either \"very successful\" or \"fairly successful\" by 79% in reducing truancy, according to a survey.

I live in Virginia, USA, and sometimes see a plant--commonly known as Kudzu--that seems to cover everything in the area, even climbing over whole trees and houses. Kudzu is an unbelievable plant since it grows very fast. It was first brought to the United States from south-east Asia around the 1870's as a crop that farmers could grow. However, Kudzu quickly came to be considered harmful throughout the southern United States. Since Kudzu grows fast in many different environments, it can completely cover areas of land quickly. The plant is also not eaten by any insects or birds in the United States so it can grow unchecked. Kudzu can cover trees, bushes, and even houses. It costs the United States 500 million dollars a year to just keep Kudzu from growing too fast.

The cups on either side were covered with the other two cards. One was the same as the sample, while the other wasn' t. The cup with the card that matched the sample card contained two worms to eat. In the second part of the experiment, the birds were tested with relational matching pairs. A card with two same- sized circles, for example, meant they should pick the test card with two same-sized squares and not two different-sized circles. The birds did well in the more difficult test and picked the correct card more than three quarters of the time. Wasserman was surprised that crows were able to solve the problem without any training in RMTS. He said in a news release: \"Honestly, if it was only by force that the crows showed this learning, then it would have been an impressive result. But this was spontaneous.\" So perhaps it' s time to stop saying \" birdbrain\" permanently. Which of the following is TURE about the tests on the crows?", "subject": ""}

Since the World Cup cannot be moved to the 'cooler' season in January or to a neighboring country with milder weather, Qatar has to figure out a solution to make the game more comfortable. A team of engineering scientists from Qatar University (QU) have taken a more high-tech approach to solving the problem - they've reportedly developed a type of artificial \"cloud\" designed to float above the World Cup venues and provide fans and players with relief from the blazing sun. The artificial clouds system was invented by a team led by Dr Saul Abdul Ghani, Head of the Mechanical and Industrial Engineering Department at QU, who told Gulf News that the \"clouds\" would be made from a lightweight carbon structure carrying a giant envelope of material containing helium gas. The \"cloud\" would also feature solar panels on its upper surface to power engines that allow the cloud to be moved via remote control. While the country officials have promised to improve some of the issues with solar-powered stadiums capable of reducing the temperatures inside, to a comfortable 20degC, there is still concern of how the players will be able to function in the practice fields.

A new experiment shows that spending 50 minutes with an active phone pressed up to the ear increases activity in the brain. This brain activity probably doesn't make you smarter. When cell phones are on, they emit   energy in the form of radiation that could be harmful, especially after years of cell phone usage. Scientists don't know yet whether cell phones are bad for the brain. Studies like this one are attempting to find it out. The 47 participants in the experiment may have looked a little strange. Each one had two Samsung cell phones attached to his or her head -- one on each ear. The phone on the left ear was off. The phone on the right ear played a message for 50 minutes, but the participants couldn't hear it because the sound was off. With this set-up, the scientists could be sure they were studying brain activity from the phone itself, and not brain activity due to listening and talking during a conversation. After 50 minutes with two phones strapped to their heads, the participants were given PET scans. The PET scan showed that the left side (the side with the phone turned off) of each participant's brain hadn't changed during the experiment. The right side of the brain, however, had used more glucose, which is a type of sugar that provides fuel to brain cells. These right-side brain cells were using almost as much glucose as the brain uses when a person is talking. This suggests that the brain cells there were active -- even without the person hearing anything. That activity, the scientists say, was probably caused by radiation from the phone.

These right-side brain cells were using almost as much glucose as the brain uses when a person is talking. This suggests that the brain cells there were active -- even without the person hearing anything. That activity, the scientists say, was probably caused by radiation from the phone.

{"answer": 1, "choices": ["Literature magazine.", "Science News.", "Story books.", "Art Journal."], "question": "Here's one number to keep in mind during your next cell phone conversation: 50. A new experiment shows that spending 50 minutes with an active phone pressed up to the ear increases activity in the brain. This brain activity probably doesn't make you smarter. When cell phones are on, they emit   energy in the form of radiation that could be harmful, especially after years of cell phone usage. Scientists don't know yet whether cell phones are bad for the brain. Studies like this one are attempting to find it out. The 47 participants in the experiment may have looked a little strange. Each one had two Samsung cell phones attached to his or her head -- one on each ear. The phone on the left ear was off. The phone on the right ear played a message for 50 minutes, but the participants couldn't hear it because the sound was off. With this set-up, the scientists could be sure they were studying brain activity from the phone itself, and not brain activity due to listening and talking during a conversation. After 50 minutes with two phones strapped to their heads, the participants were given PET scans. The PET scan showed that the left side (the side with the phone turned off) of each participant's brain hadn't changed during the experiment. The right side of the brain, however, had used more glucose, which is a type of sugar that provides fuel to brain cells.

Scientists are confident about the formation of coal, but they do not seem so sure when asked about oil. They think that the oil under the surface of the earth originated in the distant past, and was formed from living things in the sea. Countless billions of small sea creatures and plants lived and sank to the seabed. They were covered with huge deposits of mud and by process of chemistry, pressure and temperature were changed through long ages into what we know as oil. For these creatures to become oil, it was necessary that they should be imprisoned between layers of rock for a great length of time. The statement that oil originated in the sea is confirmed by a glance at a map showing the chief oilfields of the world. Very few of them are far distant from the oceans of today. In some places gas' and oil come up to the surface of the sea from its bed. The rocks in which oil is found are of the marine origin too. They are rocks which were laid down by the action of water on the' bed of the ocean. Almost always the remains of shells, and other proofs of sea life are found close to the oil. A very common sedimentary rock is called shale, which is a soft rock and was obviously formed by being deposited on the seabed. And when there is shale, there is likely to be oil.  There is a lot of luck in drilling for oil The drill may just miss the oil although it is near; on the other hand, it may strike oil at a fairly high level When the drill goes down, it brings up soil.

{"answer": 3, "choices": ["a schedule without gaps", "breaks and distractions", "the limited time", "the limited energy"], "question": "Even when you're extremely busy, you aren't using your time with 100% efficiency. There are gaps in everyone's schedule where they aren't doing anything important. Even if your schedule has no gaps, there is probably lots of time when you aren't working as fast or as effectively as you possibly could. Why aren't you completely efficient? It's because time isn't the limiting factor. If it were the limiting factor, people could work non-stop without breaks or any unproductive distractions  . Instead, people, even those who are highly productive, need to take breaks, occasionally procrastinate   and slow down on tasks throughout the day. The real and most important limiting factor for productivity is your energy levels to pay attention. Energy levels limit your productivity because when you're tired, you can have enough time and still not get everything done. Your attention ability is also limited, because even if there are a million things that need to be done, you can only focus on one or two at a time. You might not be able to insert another 4-5 hours into your schedule without making some sacrifices. But even extremely busy people can add an hour or two into their schedule without cancelling anything. The reason why it's hard to \"find time\" isn't a lack of time. It's because you don't have enough energy left to focus on something else that needs to fit into your day. I first suspected time wasn't the real problem during an extremely busy period in my life over a year ago. I was extremely busy, but at that time I still exercised regularly. I had daily to-do lists with over twenty items, and I still found time to exercise. However, after a few weeks off, due to illness, I stopped exercising. I was not busy by any standards, in fact, my schedule was incredibly light. Despite this free time, I found it hard to find time to exercise. It seemed to get pushed later and later into my schedule until it was gone. How can I explain this odd experience? I believe you have known it.

It's because time isn't the limiting factor. If it were the limiting factor, people could work non-stop without breaks or any unproductive distractions  . Instead, people, even those who are highly productive, need to take breaks, occasionally procrastinate   and slow down on tasks throughout the day. The real and most important limiting factor for productivity is your energy levels to pay attention. Energy levels limit your productivity because when you're tired, you can have enough time and still not get everything done. Your attention ability is also limited, because even if there are a million things that need to be done, you can only focus on one or two at a time. You might not be able to insert another 4-5 hours into your schedule without making some sacrifices. But even extremely busy people can add an hour or two into their schedule without cancelling anything. The reason why it's hard to \"find time\" isn't a lack of time. It's because you don't have enough energy left to focus on something else that needs to fit into your day. I first suspected time wasn't the real problem during an extremely busy period in my life over a year ago. I was extremely busy, but at that time I still exercised regularly. I had daily to-do lists with over twenty items, and I still found time to exercise. However, after a few weeks off, due to illness, I stopped exercising. I was not busy by any standards, in fact, my schedule was incredibly light. Despite this free time, I found it hard to find time to exercise. It seemed to get pushed later and later into my schedule until it was gone. How can I explain this odd experience? I believe you have known it. What is the best title of the passage?", "subject": ""}

One animal helps the other meet its needs. Sounds good, right? Not always. Some animals are not very kind to their partners. In some cases, one animal meets its needs but hurts its partner.

He was an American writer of novels and short stories, whose works are the typical writings of the Jazz Age, a term he created himself. Born into an upper middle-class Irish Catholic family, Fitzgerald was named after his famous second cousin, Francis Scott Key. He was also named after his deceased sister Louise Scott, one of two sisters who died shortly before his birth. He spent 1898-1901 in Syracuse and 1903-1908 in Buffalo, New York, where he attended Nardin Academy. When his father was fired from his company, the family returned to Minnesota, where Fitzgerald attended St. Paul Academy from 1908 to1911. He is widely regarded as one of the 20th century's greatest writers. Fitzgerald is considered to be a member of the \"Lost Generation\" of the 1920s. He finished four novels, This Side of Paradise, The Beautiful and Damned, Tender Is the Night and his most famous classic novel, The Great Gatsby. A fifth, unfinished novel, The Love of the Last Tycoon was published after his death. Fitzgerald also wrote many short stories that dealt with themes of youth. His first literary work, a detective story, was published in a school newspaper when he was 12. When he was 16, he was forced to leave St. Paul Academy for neglecting his studies. He attended Newman School, a prep school in Hackensack, New Jersey, in 1911-1912, and entered Princeton University in 1913 as a member of the Class of 1917. There he became friends with future critics and writers Edmund Wilson (Class of 1916) and John Peale Bishop (Class of 1917), and wrote for the Princeton Triangle Club. He was also a member of the University Cottage Club, which still displays Fitzgerald's desk and writing materials in its library. A poor student, Fitzgerald left Princeton to enlist   in the US Army during World War I; however, the war ended shortly after Fitzgerald's enlistment. Fitzgerald had been an alcoholic   since his college days, leaving him in poor health by the late 1930s. Fitzgerald suffered a mild attack of tuberculosis in 1919, and died of a heart attack in 1940.

But that literacy is increasingly in English, not Arabic. This English bias  starts early, with children in private \"model\" schools in the United Arab Emirates studying all their subjects, including math and science, in English. But the trend appears to be taking hold regionwide. In Saudi Arabia, many upper-middle-class families speak English at home -- not just at work . One Arabic official told me his own children do not speak Arabic fluently. He said he put them in English schools to help ensure they'd have great career prospects. But now he says he regrets that his children don't feel comfortable speaking the language of their forefathers. Why is there the anxiety among these elites? I am continually told that what I've experienced anecdotally is true: The wealthier the family, the less likely its members speak Arabic at home. If people in the same country don't speak the same language, how can they work across class lines to solve the problems of high unemployment that affect even oil-rich Saudi Arabia?

{"answer": 2, "choices": ["the popularity of English in Saudi Arabia is a good thing", "there is no problem of unemployment in Saudi Arabia", "the poor in Saudi Arabia are more likely to speak Arabic", "the English bias doesn't affect the local business"], "question": "English is fast becoming the only language of a new generation of educated Arabs. This isn't a good thing for the region or the rest of the world. The journalism school at the AUD is the only modern program in the Middle East that allows students to study in Arabic. Still, many students arrive with poorly written Arabic and the formal spoken language and require refresher Arabic language courses. Literacy  in the Gulf States is 98%, according to UNESCO. But that literacy is increasingly in English, not Arabic. This English bias  starts early, with children in private \"model\" schools in the United Arab Emirates studying all their subjects, including math and science, in English. But the trend appears to be taking hold regionwide. In Saudi Arabia, many upper-middle-class families speak English at home -- not just at work . One Arabic official told me his own children do not speak Arabic fluently. He said he put them in English schools to help ensure they'd have great career prospects. But now he says he regrets that his children don't feel comfortable speaking the language of their forefathers. Why is there the anxiety among these elites? I am continually told that what I've experienced anecdotally is true: The wealthier the family, the less likely its members speak Arabic at home. If people in the same country don't speak the same language, how can they work across class lines to solve the problems of high unemployment that affect even oil-rich Saudi Arabia? For executives  trying to build local businesses, the English bias is a challenge. The dean of the AUD's school of journalism, Ali Al Jaber, told me, \"If you can't address your own people, then you can't be successful.\" Sure, English is the world's business language. More Chinese are learning English right now than there are Americans in the U.S. But China has struck a bilingual balance.

The dinner that has become known as the First Thanksgiving was actually a harvest festival celebrated in December of 1621. That's when English settlers in Plymouth, Massachusetts, gave thanks for the progress they had made after a hard winter in their new country. As America grew, Thanksgiving customs also spread and got bigger. George Washington declared that the first national Thanksgiving would be on November 26, 1789. In the decades to follow, however, people celebrated Thanksgiving locally, with no official date. President Abraham Lincoln declared the last Thursday in November 1863 a national day of Thanksgiving. It stayed that way until 1939, when President Franklin D. Roosevelt moved it one week earlier. He wanted to lengthen the shopping period before Christmas to encourage gift-buyers and to help businesses. So Congress  ruled that, after 1941, Thanksgiving would be an official federal holiday falling on the fourth Thursday of November. This year we celebrated Thanksgiving on Thursday, November. Millions of Americans got together to give thanks with friends and family. The lucky turkey, Courage, was one of them.

Regardless of its pristine image, bottled water is not necessarily any purer or more healthful than what flows right out of the tap.  Consider that the Food and Drug Administration (FDA), the bottled water industry watchdog, does not require that bottled water meet higher standards for quality, such as the maximum level of contaminants, than public water supplies regulated by the EPA. For the most part, the FDA simply follows EPA's regulatory lead. Granted, bottled water is often filtered to remove chemicals such as chlorine that may impart a certain taste.

Furthermore, some bottled waters do not contain any or enough of the fluoride needed to fight cavities.

This is not to say that bottled water is necessarily any better or worse, from a health standpoint, than tap water. It's certainly preferable to tap water for those who like its taste.

But nowadays being overweight is seen as indicating neither a cheerful character nor beauty but an increased risk of heart disease, stroke and diabetes. So what do you do? Diet?

According to Sir Liam Donaldson, at least 30 minutes of moderate activity five days a week. Is going to the gym the answer? Luckily for those who think that running machines are boring, the Health Development Agency believes that physical activity that fits into people's lives may be more effective. They suggest taking the stairs rather than the lift, walking up escalators, playing active games with your children, dancing or gardening. And according to a sports psychologist, Professor Biddle, gyms \"are not making the nation fit\", and may even cause harm. There's new scientific evidence that too much exercise may actually be bad for you. Scientists at the University of Ulster have found that unsuitable exercise releases dangerous free radicals that can adversely (oppositely) affect normal function in unfit people. The only people who should push their bodies to that level of exercise on a regular basis are trained athletes. So, should we forget about gyms and follow some expert's advice to reduce sedentary   activities and increase exercise in our daily life? After all, getting off the bus a stop early and walking the rest of the way can't do any harm! One final thought.

Many people will travel great distances in airplanes, cars or other vehicles. Experts say people should know about other health problems that can strike when traveling by air. One of these is a condition called hypoxia  . It results from a lack of oxygen to the brain. Experts say the body begins losing oxygen minutes after an airplane leaves the ground. The air pressure in a plane during flight is lower than at sea level. This makes it more difficult for the body to effectively use the same amount of oxygen as it would on the ground. Fewer oxygen molecules   cross the tissues   in the lungs and reach the bloodstream. The result is a five to twenty percent drop in the amount of oxygen in the blood. This reduces the amount of oxygen that reaches the organs of the body. One effect of this lack of oxygen to the brain is a headache. When this happens, the heart attempts to _ by beating harder and faster. This can make the traveler feel tired. These signs of hypoxia are not dangerous in a healthy person. But a drop in oxygen level can cause a health emergency in people with heart or lung problems. They might lose consciousness or even suffer a heart attack.

Fewer oxygen molecules   cross the tissues   in the lungs and reach the bloodstream. The result is a five to twenty percent drop in the amount of oxygen in the blood. This reduces the amount of oxygen that reaches the organs of the body. One effect of this lack of oxygen to the brain is a headache. When this happens, the heart attempts to _ by beating harder and faster. This can make the traveler feel tired. These signs of hypoxia are not dangerous in a healthy person. But a drop in oxygen level can cause a health emergency in people with heart or lung problems. They might lose consciousness or even suffer a heart attack. Experts say that smoking cigarettes and drinking alcoholic liquids also reduce the body's ability to use oxygen. So they suggest that people not drink alcohol or smoke cigarettes either before or during a flight. They also say persons with heart or lung problems should seek advice from their doctors before flying. Why should passengers not smoke or drink before flying?", "subject": ""}

{"answer": 2, "choices": ["Seven", "Eight", "Nine", "Ten"], "question": "Every evening, 15-year-old Rashida returns home from school, changes out of her uniform, and rushes to a neighboring farm to help her mother harvest vegetables. Her father is disabled, so the modest profit the two of them earn must cover food, clothing and other necessities for all seven children and their parents. Despite having precious little time to study, Rashida is one of the top students at her junior secondary school. But with so much responsibility on her small shoulders, she admits that it is sometimes hard for her to imagine a more promising future. Last year, Rashida was invited to join 155 other girls at Camfed Ghana's first Girls' Career Camp, a program designed to inspire girls growing up in the country's Northern Region to dream big, and to support them to pursue those dreams. \"We organized this camp because we wanted to let girls know that even if they are struggling with poverty, their lives will not be defined by limitations,\" says Dolores Dickson, Camfed Ghana's Executive Director. Over the course of five days, the camp led the junior and secondary school students through a range of experiences and career opportunities that were entirely new to them. Dr. Agnes Apusiga, a lecturer from the University of Development Studies, ran the workshop on goal-setting and career choices, describing the universities and training colleges in Ghana that could help them achieve their dreams. Participants then visited the University for Development Studies, where they toured the medical school and science labs. Another highlight was a workshop at the computer lab at Tamale Secondary School. Many of the girls had studied information technology from a book but had never before seen a computer. \"When the girls arrived at camp, they were not ambitious, because they didn't have any idea what the world held for them,\" says Eugenia Ayagiba, Project Officer with Camfed Ghana. \"Many had scarcely traveled beyond their own villages.\" \"I think the most important thing that happened at the camp is that we opened a window of hope for a group of girls coming from backgrounds of poverty,\" says Eugenia. For Rashida, who has been laughed at in the past by her schoolmates because of her father's disability, the experience was important. \"She told one of the camp mentors  that when she is at school, she often feels like a misfit, and she prefers to keep to herself,\" says Eugenia. \"But at the camp, it was different.

{"answer": 1, "choices": ["the school committee pays no attention to them", "the school is afraid of losing financial support", "the students are not interested in both of them", "the state standardized test is more important."], "question": "Music died here last spring, or rather, it was killed by members of the school committee who ignored the importance of music and drama as part of the high-school curriculum. The committee decided that teaching students how to take a standardized test is more important than a curriculum in which students can explore their interests in the arts as well as academics. Because the school system is running out of funding, it needs to make sure that students pass the mastery test or even more money will be lost. If students fail the state standardized test, it is not the fault of drama and music classes-- they are failing because the \" academic\" classes are not sufficient. It is painful to think of how many students will be discouraged from singing, acting, and playing instruments because school programs are no longer offered.

{"answer": 1, "choices": ["They have lost their identity.", "Their children are losing their identity.", "Their children speak different languages.", "They cannot speak their native language."], "question": "Language is a way to communicate with each other. We started to learn language when we were born. However, people are used to speaking their native language, so immigrants are having many problems between the first generation and the second generation because they don't have the same native language. Also, the second generation is losing their identity. Especially in America, there are many immigrants that came from different countries to succeed in the States.  Because they suffer in lots of areas such as getting a job and trying to speak English, they want their children to speak English, not only at school, but also at home in order to be more successful. Because of this situation, their children are losing their identity and, even more, they are ignoring their parents whose English is not very good. I think most immigrants are trying to preserve their native language in their new country, but this doesn't help very much in getting a good job. My aunt taught Korean to her children not to help hem succeed in the U.S. she did so, hopefully, to help them establish a Korean identity. Though the second generation was born in the new country, they often get confused about their identity because they look different from others, and also, if they visit their parents' country, they will probably feel different from other people there too. My cousins told me that when they visited Korea a few years ago, they felt different from other Koreans. They could even feel it just strolling around the street because they wore different clothes and walked differently. We must realize that language is important and valuable for many reasons. Immigrants should make an effort not to be ignored by their children understand their background by teaching them the parents' language.

At about 11:00 PM,another ship,the Stockholm,suddenly hit the Andrea Doria. It made a huge hole in the Italian ship. Some people were badly hurt. Others fell into the sea. But one girl was saved by the Stockholm. Linda Morgan was fourteen. She lived in Spain with her mother and her little sister. She was going to visit her father in New York. She was excited about seeing her father. Linda had loved the trip. She wanted to have dinner with the captain on the last night at sea. The captain did not sit at his table that night,though.

It reports that the physical wounds of healthy seniors healed more quickly if they wrote about their most upsetting experiences. This confirms the results of a 2010 study, and extends those findings to cover older adults-a group that is likely to suffer wounds (as from surgery), and one with less access to other ways of lowering tension (such as exercise). Reported in the journal Psychosomatic Medicine, a research team led by the University of Auckland's Elizabeth Broadbent made a study featuring 50 healthy adults ranging in age from 64 to 97. They were assigned to write for 20 minutes per day for three consecutive  days. Half were asked to write about the most upsetting experience in their life, describing their deepest thoughts, feelings, and emotions about the events, ideally not previously shared with others. The others were asked to write about their daily activities without mentioning emotions, opinions or beliefs. Two weeks after the third day of writing, all participants received a standard 4mm skin biopsy  on their inner arm. The very tiny wounds caused by the biopsy were photographed regularly over the following days to determine the rate at which they healed. On the 11th day after the biopsy, the wounds completely healed on 76.2 percent of those who had done the expressive writing. That was true of only 42.1 percent of those who had written about everyday activities. \"The biological and psychological mechanisms   behind this effect remain unclear,\" the researchers wrote, noting that those who had done the expressive writing did not report lower stress levels or fewer depressive symptoms than the others in the control group.

Summer holidays don't just mean going to the water. They can also mean going for a bike ride, or a picnic. It all depends how you want to spend your summer days. If you live or spend your holiday near the water, then fishing, diving and boating are all good possibilities. In summertime, lots of people enjoy playing, picnicking, and just going out with friends on a long summer day until the sun goes down.

You are thirsty playing basketball or riding home from school. A cold drink may be just the thing. But be careful what you are drinking. Something that looks cool may not be good for your health. There are plenty of \"energy drinks\" on the market. Most of them have beautiful colors and cool names. The lists on them tell you they are helpful to your health. Sounds great! But after a careful check you may find that most energy drinks have lots of caffeine in them. These drinks are especially aimed at young people, students, busy people and sports players.

Furthermore, the new study showed that small tremors deep underground were more likely to occur during certain periods of the tidal cycle. For the study, the researchers looked at about 81,000 low-frequency earthquakes from 2008 to 2015 along the Parkfield section of the San Andreas Fault and compared it to the two-week tidal cycle known as the \"fortnightly tide,\" Low-frequency earthquakes are named due to the rumbling sound they make and not by the rate of its occurrence.

{"answer": 3, "choices": ["It has become an effective tool in fighting HIV.", "It was first found by Permar and her research group.", "It can prevent transmission in a live animal effectively.", "It can sometimes prevent mother-to-child transmission of HIV."], "question": "For decades, public health officials have puzzled over a surprising fact about HIV: Only about 10-20 percent of infants who are breastfed by infected mothers catch the virus. Tests show, though, that HIV is indeed present in breast milk, so these children are exposed to the virus multiple times daily for the first several months of their lives. Now, a group of scientists and doctors from Duke University has figured out why these babies don't get infected. Human breast milk naturally contains a protein called Tenascin C that neutralizes HIV and, in most cases, prevents it from being passed from mother to child. Eventually, they say, the protein could potentially be valuable as an HIV-fighting tool for both infants and adults that are either HIV-positive or at risk of contracting the infection. The research, published in Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences, was inspired by previous work by other researchers showing that, both in tissue cultures   and live mice, breast milk from HIV-negativemothers was naturally endowed with HIV-fighting properties. Scientists suggested that a few different proteins in the milk could potentially be responsible, but no one knew which one. As part of the study, the researchers divided breast milk into smaller fractions   made up of specific proteins via a number of filters   -- separating the proteins by size, electrical charge and other characteristics--and tested which of these fractions, when added to a tissue culture, prevented the cells from being infected by HIV. Eventually, they found that one particular protein was present in all the HIV-resistant fractions but in none of the others: Tenascin C. Tenascin C works by blocking a key protein on HIV's envelope that normally ties up to a receptor on a T cell's membrane called CCR5. In doing so, Tenascin C prevents HIV from mixing with the T cell and injecting its RNA inside. Still, the researchers say that other natural elements in milk might play a role in fighting HIV as well. \"It's clearly not the whole story, because we do have samples that have low amounts of this protein but still have HIV-neutralizing activity,\" the study's lead author Permar says. \"So it may be acting in concert with other antiviral and antimicrobial factors in the milk.\" Whatever those other factors are, though, the finding vindicates (......) recent changes to UN guidelines that recommend even HIV-positive mothers in resource-poor countries should breastfeed, if they're taking anti-retroviral drugs to combat their own infection. The next steps, Permar says, are determining which area of Tenascin C is active and whether it can effectively prevent transmission in a live animal. If it works, it could potentially be incorporated   into an HIV drug with broader applications. It's even possible that it could someday be adapted to reduce the risk of HIV transmission in adults as well as infants. Which of the following about Tenascin C is true?", "subject": ""}

But when the result is not good, they will come back to ask \" how do we get people to get the sort of self-control that leads to success? \" This is to enter the world of human nature. So these experiments along with everyday experience, tell us that self-control is most important. Young people who can sit through sometimes boring classes to get a degree can work hard in order to learn a language well. They can avoid drugs and alcohol. For people without self-control skills, however, school is a series of failed ordeals  . No wonder they drop out and their later life is a group of foolish ideas, such as drug use, stealing and so on. What is the best title for this passage?", "subject": ""}

If you pay attention to those things, you'll find you are able to easily understand how your dog is feeling. Ears and face The head of a dog is more expressive than you think. If you say a word that he recognizes, like his name or something you say often, his ears will get up. His mouth is another good instruction. A mouth that is wide open to pant   with some sound suggests that the dog is happy -- some people even say when a dog is panting, he is laughing as he cools himself. A tongue sticking out suggests that the dog is in a good mood. Eyes To a dog, purple and blue are both seen as shades of blue. Red is seen as black or dark grey. Orange, yellow and green are seen as various shades of yellow. This means that, to a dog, bright orange toys are the same yellow shade. If you want your dog to clearly see his toys in the green grass you'd better give the dog blue toys; if you have orange, yellow or green toys, the dog will be able to find them with his nose. Nose A dog can both sniff and breathe through his nose. Breathing is for air, but when dogs sniff with short breaths they are actually following some scents   with his keen   nose. When a dog is overheated, his sense of smell is reduced by as much as 40 percent and he uses the air to cool himself rather than for smelling. Puppies' noses can help find their mother when their eyes and ears are closed. The function will disappear by the time they are adults. Tail Lastly, you need to pay attention to your dog's tail, because it shows what he is thinking and feeling. A dog that is in a good mood will have a tail that seems to be going a mile a minute -- wagging, and excited. However, an angry or frightened dog will have his tail between his legs.

{"answer": 3, "choices": ["the history of American music", "the famous rock and roll groups", "the new forms of rock and roll music", "the development of rock and roll music"], "question": "Rock and roll music developed in the United States in the early nineteen-fifties. It was based on the music called rhythm and blues that was performed by African American musicians. Early rock and roll singers developed their own kinds of music. Elvis Presley, Chuck Berry, the Beach Boys, and Bob Dylan were the most popular rock and roll musicians in the early 1960's. All were American. Then, in 1964, a new rock and roll group from England invaded America: the Beatles. Some people say the Beatles' music shook America like an earthquake. The Beatles changed rock and roll forever. Their early songs were influenced by American rock and roll musicians, including Chuck Berry. But the Beatles looked different and sounded different from any musical group before them.

The back garden usually also has a lawn and flower beds, and sometimes a vegetable plot  fruit trees. There's often a bird table, on which food is put for birds, and a small simple house in which garden tools are kept. Many British people spend quite a lot of money on their gardens and even the smallest may contain different kinds of flowers and plants. For them gardening is a hobby and they take pride in their gardens. Some towns and villages have competitions for the best-kept small garden. People with a small garden, or no garden at all, can rent a piece of land, on which most grow vegetables. There are garden centers near most towns, selling everything a gardener might need, from flower pots to fish ponds as well as many types of plants.

It lies in West Africa on the Gulf   of Guinea, to the south of Burkina Faso and Niger, between Togo on the west and Nigeria on the east. Benin used to be called Dahomey and was controlled and ruled by France from 1893 to 1960, when it became independent. In 1963 the army general Soglo overthrew   the first president Maga. Soglo set up an army government and called himself head of state in 1965, but was overthrown and replaced by a civilian   government in 1967. In December 1969 Benin had another change of power with the army again taking over. In May 1970, Maga and two other men set up a new government, with each of them acting as president in turn for two years. However, half a year after Maga turned over power to the second man Ahomadegbe, the three-man government was overthrown by the army once more and General Kerekou became president.

Other days, however, especially those celebrated in western countries, often owe their origins to a particular person. One of the most popular of these, even though it is fairly recent, is Mother's Day. Mothers have always been highly regarded in all cultures.

The Christian Church adopted this idea and called it Mothering Sunday. However, over the years this custom was gradually forgotten and almost disappeared by the end of the 19th century. Born in 1864 in Virginia, USA, Anna Jarvis was a school teacher and believed children should show gratitude to their mothers for all their love and care. Encouraged by a friend, she wrote to thousands of important people--politicians, churchmen, doctors, city officials--and asked them to support her idea: a special day of the year for thanking mothers. In 1910 the Governor of West Virginia introduced Mother's Day into the state. The date chosen was May 10--the second Sunday in May, which is still observed in America today. This date was chosen because May 10 was the date on which in 1908 Anna Jarvis's mother had died. In 1914 President Woodrow Wilson made May 10 the official date for Mother's Day throughout the United States.

Born in 1864 in Virginia, USA, Anna Jarvis was a school teacher and believed children should show gratitude to their mothers for all their love and care. Encouraged by a friend, she wrote to thousands of important people--politicians, churchmen, doctors, city officials--and asked them to support her idea: a special day of the year for thanking mothers. In 1910 the Governor of West Virginia introduced Mother's Day into the state. The date chosen was May 10--the second Sunday in May, which is still observed in America today. This date was chosen because May 10 was the date on which in 1908 Anna Jarvis's mother had died. In 1914 President Woodrow Wilson made May 10 the official date for Mother's Day throughout the United States. Soon there was a Mother's Day International Association and the custom began to be adopted in many countries of the world. Anna Jarvis, a sad and disillusioned  woman, died in 1948. The custom she had worked so hard to establish and which had become almost universal had lost its original purpose. It had been taken over by business. Like Christmas, the giving of presents and the sending of cards had become a multi-million-dollar industry. Unfortunately, Anna Jarvis was not happy with Mother's Day when she died because    _    .", "subject": ""}

She doesn't have a bunch of friends travelling overseas at the moment ---- she's just really active in the underground hobby of Postcrossing. \"I've sent over 3,000 postcards, but I've been doing it for close to seven years,\" she says. \"My husband, generally appreciative of my hobby, is sometimes frustrated by the amount of cardboard hanging around the house or in my car.\" Postcrossing is a hobby where strangers send each other postcards across the world. You register on the website, list your interests and preferences for postcards, then receive an address of a stranger on the other side of the world to send a postcard to. \"I tend to send a lot of postcards of the local area because people are interested in where you're from and what you do,\" Emma says. From Uzbekistan to Belarus and Kazakhstan to Moldova, Emma has a growing collection of photos from around the world. The postcards have helped shape her international travelling too. \"I didn't travel overseas until I was 32 and a lot of the locations we chose for our honeymoon were selected because of the postcards I'd received.\" \"Some people see sending mail as being a bit boring and unfashionable, but Postcrossing is popular and lots of people are fascinated that I do it.,\" The Postcrossing project has just celebrated its eighth birthday and has over 400,000 active members in 215 countries. The group says they've delivered over 18 million postcards. And while postal workers aren't supposed to read people's postcards, Emma says she's happy for them to do so at her post office in Shellharbour. She even encourages her correspondents to say hello to the Australia Post staff. \"It's a hobby that I continue to do because I find it enjoyable and relaxing.\" The Postcrossing project  _  .", "subject": ""}

The latest trend in plastic surgery promises to create a nose that is similar to the curve of the Eiffel Tower. Surgeon Wang Xuming said: \"We are influenced by the beauty of the Eiffel Tower. We are not content to just add something to the nose; we reconstruct it.\" The surgery costs about US$ 10,000 and involves the enlarging of the nose using tissue from the forehead. Hundreds of posters advertising the procedure are put up all over Chongqing city, where surgeon Xuming runs his private practice. They show a western-looking woman with an almost-too-perfect nose, against an outline of the Eiffel Tower. Interestingly, many young women in China are eager to achieve a western appearance, as they believe it will give them an advantage in the highly competitive job market. \"Some students face a lot of employment pressure after graduation. If their facial features are good, they'll have more chances of finding a job,\" said surgeon Xuming. \"We've had students getting the Eiffel Tower nose; it's helped them a lot.\" Apparently, Chinese employers are quite particular about appearances and prefer attractive candidates. Some of them even go as far as putting height and weight requirements in their employment ads. Plastic surgeons across the country are reporting an increase in the number of students choosing beauty \"improvement\".

BothIndiaandBrazilare developing a world-class software industry. Their weapon is quality and one of their jobs is to attract the topU.S.quality specialists whose voices are not listened to in their country.       Already, of the world's 12 software houses that have earned the highest rating in the world, seven are in India. That's largely because they have used new methods rejected by American software specialists. For example, for decades, quality specialists, W. Edwards Deming and J. M. Juran had urgedU.S.software companies to change their attitudes to quality. But their quality call mainly fell on deaf ears in the U.S -- but not in Japan. By the 1970s and 1980s,Japanwas grabbing market share with better, cheaper products. They used Deming's and Juran's ideas to bring down the cost of good quality to as little as 5% of total production costs. InU.S.factories, the cost of quality then was 10 times as high: 50%. In software, it still is.       Watts S. Humphrey spent 27 years at IBM heading up software production and then quality assurance. But his advice was seldom paid attention to. He retired from IBM in 1986. In 1987, he worked out a system for assessing(evaluating) and improving software quality. It has proved its value time and again. For example, in 1990 the cost of quality at Raytheon Electronics Systems was almost 60% of total software production costs. It fell to 15% in 1996 and has since further dropped to below 10%.

All of the models of hybrid car will save money, but are they really effective when all of the costs of maintenance and other considerations are included in? First of all, consider the cost of buying a hybrid vehicle. Depending on the model, hybrid vehicles can cost anywhere from $2,000 to $5,000 more than the traditional models. However, some say that as the hybrid cars become increasingly more available as a reflection of demand, the prices can be expected to drop, making them more cost effective when it comes to the initial investment. Also important to keep in mind is the fact that the hybrid cars have a much more specialized system than the standard vehicle, and will therefore require more specialized workers to repair them when they break down. It seems as though, at least for the time being, the purchase of a hybrid vehicle for the average consumer may not be the best choice when it comes to saving money. It is important to keep several things in mind, however, when considering purchasing a hybrid model. Many consumers are choosing to purchase these cars because they represent a significant development in terms of environmental concerns over standard models. They also mean that as a whole, Western nations will become less dependent on oil as the only means of power. Finally, it is necessary to remember that the hybrid car is a very new technology. Developed only within the last few years, the technology is still in the starting stage, where costs will continue to be high.

All of the models of hybrid car will save money, but are they really effective when all of the costs of maintenance and other considerations are included in? First of all, consider the cost of buying a hybrid vehicle. Depending on the model, hybrid vehicles can cost anywhere from $2,000 to $5,000 more than the traditional models. However, some say that as the hybrid cars become increasingly more available as a reflection of demand, the prices can be expected to drop, making them more cost effective when it comes to the initial investment. Also important to keep in mind is the fact that the hybrid cars have a much more specialized system than the standard vehicle, and will therefore require more specialized workers to repair them when they break down. It seems as though, at least for the time being, the purchase of a hybrid vehicle for the average consumer may not be the best choice when it comes to saving money. It is important to keep several things in mind, however, when considering purchasing a hybrid model. Many consumers are choosing to purchase these cars because they represent a significant development in terms of environmental concerns over standard models. They also mean that as a whole, Western nations will become less dependent on oil as the only means of power. Finally, it is necessary to remember that the hybrid car is a very new technology.

Walking quickly across the hall, I fished some change from my pocket. There was usually someone at the exit selling The Big Issue(a magazine that helps homeless folk earn a living). As the crowd parted ways at the bottom of the hall, I saw someone selling the Big Issue. You had to be homeless to sell the Big Issue. She really looked like she'd been sleeping rough. Her clothes were ragged and she was also rocking from side to side. At first I thought maybe she was trying to keep warm against the biting wind, But she wasn't ,she was moving in time to a tune. I couldn't hear her, but I could see her lips moving. As I got closer, I saw a white cane hanging from her elbow and noticed that she had sunken( ) eyes.

This is no exaggeration , for reports show that man's greed has done much to destroy the earth. Man, in his greedy desire for financial growth, has polluted the air, land and water, and has robbed our valuable natural resources. Man's industrial plants pour out poisonous waste that pollutes the sea and puts life in the sea under the threat of dying out; at the same time, they release alarming amounts of carbon dioxide, chlorofluorocarbons (CFCs) and other pollutants. Small wonder that the air now is much warmer and more impure than ever before. Of course, this is not just because of man's greed--it is man's pressing need as well. For instance, in developing countries, huge financial foreign debts have forced governments to approve the cutting of forests for agriculture or ranching. As a result, forests are cut down just to meet man's immediate needs. Perhaps unknowingly,man has changed the make-up of the earth's atmosphere. Scientific studies have shown that CFCs used in refrigerators and industrial cleaners are fast destroying the ozone layer--a protective layer in the atmosphere that protects us against the harmful effects of the sun's ultraviolet  rays. In fact, documented reports have shown a terrible fact that there are \"holes\" in the ozone layer over the Antarctic. And they appear to be expanding. Faced with these environmental problems, world leaders have shown deep concern. The UN Environmental Programme (UNEP) has arranged international agreements like the Vienna convention of 1985 and the Montreal Protocol of 1989 to preserve the ozone layer by controlling the production, use and trade of destructive chemicals. There may be some doubt as to how effectual these agreements may be, given that some countries still maintain an \"I-don't-care\" attitude. Their attitude is probably due to their failure to grasp the importance of the problem. Then, there is no doubt that environmental education on an international scale is greatly needed, so that all countries, great and small--the \"haves\" and the \"have nots\"--may realize their responsibilities for our planet.

The UN Environmental Programme (UNEP) has arranged international agreements like the Vienna convention of 1985 and the Montreal Protocol of 1989 to preserve the ozone layer by controlling the production, use and trade of destructive chemicals. There may be some doubt as to how effectual these agreements may be, given that some countries still maintain an \"I-don't-care\" attitude. Their attitude is probably due to their failure to grasp the importance of the problem. Then, there is no doubt that environmental education on an international scale is greatly needed, so that all countries, great and small--the \"haves\" and the \"have nots\"--may realize their responsibilities for our planet.

{"answer": 0, "choices": ["Hopeful.", "Unconcerned", "Doubtful", "Objective"], "question": "It is often said that man has become the enemy of our planet. This is no exaggeration , for reports show that man's greed has done much to destroy the earth. Man, in his greedy desire for financial growth, has polluted the air, land and water, and has robbed our valuable natural resources. Man's industrial plants pour out poisonous waste that pollutes the sea and puts life in the sea under the threat of dying out; at the same time, they release alarming amounts of carbon dioxide, chlorofluorocarbons (CFCs) and other pollutants. Small wonder that the air now is much warmer and more impure than ever before. Of course, this is not just because of man's greed--it is man's pressing need as well. For instance, in developing countries, huge financial foreign debts have forced governments to approve the cutting of forests for agriculture or ranching. As a result, forests are cut down just to meet man's immediate needs. Perhaps unknowingly,man has changed the make-up of the earth's atmosphere. Scientific studies have shown that CFCs used in refrigerators and industrial cleaners are fast destroying the ozone layer--a protective layer in the atmosphere that protects us against the harmful effects of the sun's ultraviolet  rays.

Surprisingly though, there is no official, universal name for this sign. There are dozens of strange terms to describe the \"@\" symbol. Before it became the standard symbol for electronic mail, the \"@\" symbol was used to represent the cost of something or how heavy something is. For instance, if you purchased 6 apples, you might write it as 6 apples \"@\" $1.10 each. With the introduction of e-mail came the popularity of the \"@\" symbol. The \"@\" symbol or the \"at sign\" separates a person's online user name from his mail server  address. For instance, joe@uselessknowledge.com. Its widespread use on the Internet made it necessary to put this symbol on keyboards in other countries that have never seen or used the symbol before. As a result, there is really no official name for this symbol. The actual origin of the symbol remains a mystery. History tells us that the @ symbol came from the tired hands of the Middle Ages. During the Middle Ages before the invention of printing machines, every letter of a word had to be copied with great efforts by hand for each copy of a published book. The monks that performed these long, boring coping duties looked for ways to reduce the number of individual strokes   per word for common words.

With tears in eyes, he said it had gotten too hard for him to care for the dog. He added that he was planning on heading to Washington State but his dog wouldn't have been up to it, so he hoped to give it to me. \"Only you! In this city, you are the only person I can believe in!\" Now, every time I watch and pat the dog lying near the fireplace, I will remember the old man's words and wish him good luck.

This was not the answer he would expect.\"Interesting idea,\"he said.\"I kind of wish I'd done that when I was your age.\"I wailed. \"You have plenty of time.You need to find out what you really enjoy now.Look,it's late. Let's take the boat out tomorrow morning,just you and me. Maybe we can catch some crabs for dinner,and we can talk more.\" Early next morning we set off along the coast. We didn't talk much,but enjoyed the sound of the seagulls and the sight of the coastline and the sea beyond. There was no surf on the coastal waters at that time.\"Let's see if we get lucky,\"he said,picked up a mesh basket with a rope attached and threw it into the sea. We waited a while,then my father stood up and said,\"Give me a hand with this,\"and we pulled up the crab cage onto the deck. The cage was filled with dozens of soft shell crabs.\"Why don't they try to escape?\" \"just watch them for a moment. Look at that one,there!He's trying to climb out,but every time the other crabs pull him back in,\"said my father. After several times,not only did the crab give up its struggle to escape,but it actually began to help stop other crabs trying to escape.He'd finally chosen an easy way of life. Suddenly I understood why my father had suggested catching crabs that morning. He looked at me. \"Don't get pulled back by the others,\"he said.\"Spend some time figuring out who you are and what you want in life.Think about what's really important to you,what really interests you,what skills you have.If you can't answer these questions now,then take some time to find out. Because if you don't,you'll never be happy.\" My father started the motor and we set off back home. What is the best title for the story?", "subject": ""}

But for a creature called the Cuvier's beaked whale, hearing starts in the throat, a new study found.  The observation might help explain how all whales hear. The work might also help scientists understand how animals are affected by underwater sonar  . This sonar, used by some ships, sends out sound waves to locate underwater objects.  The Cuvier's beaked whale is a so-called toothed whale. Toothed whales dive deep into the ocean in search of food. As the whales hunt, they produce sounds that reach objects and then return to the whales. This allows the animals to \"see\" the shape, size, and location of objects, even when they're 1,000 meters under the sea, where it is totally dark.  To better understand how the whale hears, researchers from San Diego State University in California took X-rays of two Cuvier's beaked whales. The whales had died and washed up on the beach.  Ted Cranford and his colleagues used the images to make a computer model of a Cuvier's beaked whale's head. Then, they modeled the process of sound traveling through the head.

But Albert and other scientists are doing something to help people assert themselves. They offer assertiveness training courses, A.T.for short.In the A.T.course people learn that they have a right to be themselves.They learn to speak out and feel good about doing so.They learn to be confident without hurting other people. In one way, learning to speak out is to get rid of fear.A group taking an A.T.course will help the _ person to lose his fear.But A.T.uses an even stronger motive to share the need.The timid person speaks out in the group because he wants to tell how he feels.

Three of four bears inspected Thursday near Kaktovik showed the symptoms as well. Scientists have been collecting blood and tissue samples from the suffering bears, but they do not know the cause or the significance of the outbreak, the Anchorage Daily News reported. \"Our data set suggests that this is unusual but not unprecedented,\" DeGange said. Ten of 48 bears checked by the team in 1998-1999 had a similar condition, he said. In a long-standing project, the USGS has sent polar bear research teams to the area since 1984.

{"answer": 0, "choices": ["complicated", "uncivilized", "primitive", "wellknown"], "question": "It is said that a great many things about languages are mysterious, and many will always be so. But some things we do know.  Firstly, we know that all human beings have a language of some kind. There is no race of men anywhere on earth so backward that it has no language, no set of speech sounds by which the people communicate with one another. In historical times, there has never been a race of men without a language. Secondly, there is no such thing as a primitive language. There are many people whose cultures are underdeveloped, who are, as we say, uncivilized, but the languages they speak are not primitive. In all known languages we can see complexities that must have been tens of thousands of years in developing. This has not always been well understood; indeed, the direct contrary has often been stated. Popular ideas of the language of the American Indians will illustrate. Many people have guessed that the Indians communicated in a very primitive system of noises. Study has proved this to be nonsense. There are, or were, hundreds of American Indian languages, and all of them turn out to be very complicated and very old. They are certainly different from the languages that most of us are familiar with, but they are no more primitive than English and Greek. A third thing we know about language is that all languages are perfectly adequate. This means each one is a perfect means of expressing the culture of the people who speak the language. Finally, we know that language changes. It's natural and normal for language to change; the only languages which do not change are the dead ones.

{"answer": 3, "choices": ["challenge", "knowledge", "learning", "opportunity"], "question": "The other day my aunt paid me a visit. She was overjoyed. \"I got the highest mark in the mid-term examination!\" She said. Don't be surprised! My aunt is indeed a student, exactly, a college student at the age of 45. \"Compared with the late 70s,\" she says, \"now college students have many doors.\" I was shocked when she first told me how she had had no choice in her major. Look at us today! So many doors are open to us! I believe there have never been such abundant opportunities for self-development as we have today. And my aunt told me that we should reach our goals by grasping all these opportunities. The first door is the opportunity to study different subjects that interest us. My aunt was happy to study management, but she could also attend lectures on ancient Chinese poetry and on Shakespearean drama. As for myself, I am an English major, but I may also go to lectures on history. The second door is the door to the outside world. Learning goes beyond classrooms and national boundaries. I have many fellow international classmates, and I am applying to an exchange program with a university abroad. As for my aunt, she is planning to get an MBA degree in the U.K. The third door is the door to life-long learning. Many of my aunt's contemporaries say she's amazingly up-to-date for a middle-aged woman. She simply responds, \"Age doesn't matter. What matters is your attitude. I don't think I'm too old to learn.\" Yes, she is right. Since the government removed the age limit for college admissions, there are already some untraditional students, sitting with us in the same classrooms. Like them, my aunt is old but young in spirit with incredible energy and determination. The doors open to us also pose challenges. For instance, we are faced with the challenge of a balanced learning, the challenge of preserving our fine tradition while learning from the West, and the challenge of learning continuously while carrying heavy responsibilities to our work and family. So, each door is a test of our courage, ability and judgment, but with the support of my teachers, parents, friends and my aunt, I believe I can meet the challenge head on.

In those days, the people did not really eat chocolate. They used the cocoa bean   to make a chocolate drink and they enjoyed it very much. Many years later, the cocoa bean was brought to other countries and people came to love the taste of chocolate.               In 1824, John Cadbury opened a small shop in Britain. One of the things he sold was chocolate drink. In 1831, he opened a factory to make chocolate drink. He wanted to encourage people to drink chocolate instead of other drinks. A few years later, a man called Joseph Fry found a way to make chocolate instead of only drinking it. But at that time chocolate was very expensive and only the rich people could buy it. Later, ad more and more chocolate bars were produced and sold, it became cheaper.               However, at first only plain chocolate (a kind of chocolate without milk and with very little sugar) was produced. Milk chocolate came later and this was made by adding milk to the chocolate. The first milk chocolate bar was made in Cadbury's factory in 1897. Their most famous chocolate, Cadbury's Milk Bar, was made in 1905, It has been the most popular chocolate in Britain and around the world for over 100 years. The Cadbury factory is still in Britain and the chocolate produced there is eaten all over the world. Every year, thousands of visitors visit the factory in order to see how chocolate is made. At first, not many people bought chocolate_.", "subject": ""}

Professor Marcia Dawkins is among a select group of people who have been given a chance to test out Google Glass. \"I thought this is something I definitely need for my classroom and hopefully for my personal life too.\" The Professor's Google Glass looks like a pair bright orange glasses, without the actual glass. But there's a tiny rectangular glass at the top right-hand corner. Through that glass, she has been recording video while biking. She also has been able to talk to her sister in Thailand, and she plans to use the device to teach a public speaking class. But not everyone is excited about Google Glass. Some are concerned about possible risks to privacy. John Simpson is the director of the privacy project at Consumer Watchdog. \"It is going to allow people to come in and spy on you and record that, without you knowing what is going on.\" Filmmaker Chris Barrett showed just how easy it is to record people without them knowing it. His glass captured a man getting arrested after a fight. He shared the video on You Tube. Also some are concerned about the use of facial recognition technology on Google Glass. But Google says it will not approve the use of such applications. The Internet company says it is still testing its new device, and it hopes to make Google Glass available to the public by early next year. What can be inferred from the passage?", "subject": ""}

One morning we awoke to total darkness at 5 o'clock.As we rushed through a town with cameras in hand,I noticed the calm,gentle way the Nepalese people greeted the morning.One man boiled a huge pot of milk tea,and other villagers gathered around his fire,cupping their hands around small glasses of the steaming sweet mixture.It was fascinating,but not to be left behind,we joined the stream of tourists moving quickly up to the lookout point. The top was crowded when we arrived,but after 10 minutes of cold waiting,the assembled group gave up.\"The cloud cover is too heavy,\"one said.Then one by one they rushed down the hill to the next item on their sightseeing list.I was disappointed as well,but suddenly I noticed a small Nepalese boy absently playing with a stick and shooting quick glances at the clouds.He must know something we don't,I thought.I decided to wait with him. The boy and I didn't have to wait long.Moments later,a tiny stream of golden light burned through one thick cloud,then another.Rose-colored fog warmed the backs of the clouds,and suddenly the morning sun stole a glance around the side of the mountain,mile above where I'd expected it to be. Nothing I'd seen before prepared me for the moment the clouds withdrew with bowed heads,and the magnificent Himalayas were revealed before,around,and above me.I sat in astonishment,not breathing,not daring to look away,certain that God had placed me here at the backdoor of Earth to show me what Heaven really looks like.I certainly got the message.Never again will I rush a sunrise.I now know Nature will supply her fruits to me only when I am truly ready to receive them.

Or should I (Plan B) admit it and hope that I could blag  my way in on the \"I've been coming to this library for 40 years...\" line?  I went for Plan A. Two reasons really. I think I could probably blag (or cry) my way in, but I thought it might get the entry staff into trouble. They've known me for ages, but rules are rules. Besides, I thought there was a good chance that my old card would still work the turnstile even if it had been cancelled. And if it didn't work, I could still try Plan B. The answer was my old card did still work. I looked up that tricky little article about the Middle East, then I went off to my own little Library, knocked on the window and got let in by a graduate student (I am sure there are also rules about not letting professors in when they haven't got their card, even if desperate and crying). And there was good news. There under the pile of books I had been using the night before was the lost card. The writer seems to be a   _   person.", "subject": ""}

{"answer": 3, "choices": ["academic requirements", "social expectations", "financial rewards", "internal needs"], "question": "Suppose you become a leader in an organization. It's very likely that you'll want to have volunteers to help with the organization's activities. To do so, it should help to understand why people undertake volunteer work and what keeps their interest in the work. Let's begin with the question of why people volunteer. Researchers have identified several factors that motivate people to get involved. For example, people volunteer to express personal values related to unselfishness, to expand their range of experiences, and to strengthen social relationships. If volunteer positions do not meet these needs, people may not wish to participate. To select volunteers, you may need to understand the motivations of the people you wish to attract. People also volunteer because they are required to do so. To increase levels of community service, some schools have launched compulsory volunteer programs. Unfortunately, these programs can shift people's wish of participation from an internal factor (e.g., \"I volunteer because it's important to me\") to an external factor (e.g., \"I volunteer because I'm required to do so\"). When that happens, people become less likely to volunteer in the future. People must be sensitive to this possibility when they make volunteer activities a must. Once people begin to volunteer, what leads them to remain in their positions over time? To answer this question, researchers have conducted follow-up studies in which they track volunteers over time. For instance, one study followed 238 volunteers in Florida over a year. One of the most important factors that influenced their satisfaction as volunteers was the amount of suffering they experienced in their volunteer positions. Although this result may not surprise you, it leads to important practical advice. The researchers note that attention should be given to \"training methods that would prepare volunteers for troublesome situations or provide them with strategies for coping with the problem they do experience\". Another study of 302 volunteers at hospitals in Chicago focused on individual differences in the degree to which people view \"volunteer\" as an important social role. It was assumed that those people for whom the role of volunteer was most part of their personal identity would also be most likely to continue volunteer work. Participants indicated the degree to which the social role mattered by responding to statements such as \"Volunteering in Hospital is an important part of who I am.\" Consistent with the researchers' expectations, they found a positive correlation   between the strength of role identity and the length of time people continued to volunteer.

They took fourteen subjects instead of the six that are usual in the United States. There were almost no outside activities. Family life, too, was different. The father's word was law, and all activities were around the family rather than the individual. Fred found the food too simple at first. Also, he missed having a car. \"Back home, you pick up some friends in a car and go out and have a good time. In Germany, you walk, but you soon learn to like it.\" At the same time, in America, Mike, a friendly German boy, was also forming his idea. \"I suppose I shouldcriticize2American schools,\" he says. \"It is far too easy by our level. But I have to say that I like it very much. In Germany we do nothing but study. Here we take part in many outside activities. I think that maybe your schools are better in training for citizens.

Since then, he has decided to choose his career as a wildlife protector. He went to school to learn more first of all. After he earned his doctor's degree, he eagerly signed up for a job studying cougars  , which once lived throughout the United States, but now live mainly in the Rocky Mountains and westward. They need not only a lot of land to survive but also plenty of food and places to raise their young. But many wild areas have been divided by freeways and taken over by towns. The small wilderness areas of the Santa Ana Mountains in Southern California didn't have much room for them. And yet a few still lived there. How did they do it? Many big animals are disappearing. Those that survive are being trapped in shrinking patches of habitat. A patch may not have enough space or food for a cougar to survive. Scientists wondered if cougars could move from one patch to another. If so, maybe humans could preserve wildlife corridors to connect the patches, providing enough room for the animals. But no one had shown that animals use wildlife corridors in real life. To see if cougars had found corridors through local suburbs and freeways, Paul and his research team studied 32 cougars for five years. They used a drug to make each cat sleep, buckled a radio collar around its neck, and let it go. Every day, Paul used an electrical device that sends and receives radio signals to find cougars, listening for radio beeps from their collars. Once or twice a week, he trailed one of the cougars all night. He traced their travels on a map. Sure enough, some of them had discovered paths from one small park land to the next. One cougar became famous for his travels. He was named M6:\"M\"for Male, and\"6\"because he was the sixth one collared in the study. M6's corner of the Santa Ana Mountains wasn't large enough for him. Chino Hills State Park was not far away, but the trip was not safe. After dark, M6 used a paved vehicle underground passage to cross undera busy eight-lane freeway. He slipped by a riding stable, and then picked his way through a golf course and across two sets of busy railroad tracks. Finally, he arrived in the sheltered canyons of 12,000-acre Chino Hills State Park. There, the cougar found deer to hunt. During a year and a half, the scientists recorded M6 making this journey 22 times! Then Paul learned of plans to build houses, gas stations, and a mall that would block M6's path. Paul once said,\"The loss of this corridor would guarantee the extinction of the cougar from the Chino Hills and endanger the entire population of lions in the Santa Ana Mountains.\"A local citizens' group called Hills for Everyone raised money to buy the land and add it to the state park. When the group visited the state capital and showed the map that Paul had made of M6's journeys, the lawmakers saw how important the corridor was. The lawmakers had the passage preserved, with the pavement removed and with native bushes near the openings. While traffic roared above, M6 and other cougars could move safely between the state park and the mountains. Other animals such as deer, foxes, and bobcats could also use the corridor.

Nauru's real troubles began in 1899 when a British mining company discovered phosphate  on the island.In fact, it found that the island of Nauru was nearly all phosphate, which was a very important fertilizer for farming.The company began mining the phosphate. A phosphate mine is not a hole in the ground; it is a strip mine.When a company strip-mines, it removes the top layer of soil.Then it takes away the material it wants.Strip mining totally destroys the land.Gradually, the lovely island of Nauru started to look like the moon. In 1968, Nauru became one of the richest countries in the world.Every year the government received millions and millions of dollars for its phosphate. Unfortunately, the leaders invested the money unwisely and lost millions of dollars.In addition, they used millions more dollars for personal expenses.Soon people realized that they had a terrible problem -- their phosphate was running out.Ninety percent of their island was destroyed and they had nothing.By 2000, Nauru was financially ruined.Experts say that it would take approximately $433,600,000 and more than 20 years to repair the island.This will probably never happen.

Nauru's real troubles began in 1899 when a British mining company discovered phosphate  on the island.In fact, it found that the island of Nauru was nearly all phosphate, which was a very important fertilizer for farming.The company began mining the phosphate. A phosphate mine is not a hole in the ground; it is a strip mine.When a company strip-mines, it removes the top layer of soil.Then it takes away the material it wants.Strip mining totally destroys the land.Gradually, the lovely island of Nauru started to look like the moon. In 1968, Nauru became one of the richest countries in the world.Every year the government received millions and millions of dollars for its phosphate. Unfortunately, the leaders invested the money unwisely and lost millions of dollars.In addition, they used millions more dollars for personal expenses.Soon people realized that they had a terrible problem -- their phosphate was running out.Ninety percent of their island was destroyed and they had nothing.By 2000, Nauru was financially ruined.Experts say that it would take approximately $433,600,000 and more than 20 years to repair the island.This will probably never happen.

A car brings with it the freedom to travel\", said a friend of mine while reading a car magazine. I might not agree with him, but no doubt he was speaking for a rapidly growing number of middle-class Chinese. While it is true that all the waiting, walking, being part of a crowd, and sweating, are somewhat unpleasant, there are many problems which can arise when our lives rely too much on this invention. First of all, in terms of polluting the environment, driving a car is the worst act an average person can _ . Beijing now finds itself at the top of the list of the most polluted capital cities in the world with Mexico City in the second place. Research also shows that by 2010 around 90% of total pollutants in Shanghai have come from cars. These pollutions are extremely dangerous to our health. They can damage the lungs, cause cancer, and damage the brain. Apart from environmental problems, relying too much on cars also creates social problems such as traffic jams, road accidents, and noise pollution. The jeeps that proudly drive through the Hutongs in Beijing as if they are in a race often annoy me, and to make it worse, these drivers seldom respect cyclists. Of course, we cannot forget the convenience that cars bring us when we need to travel far, but I often find it faster to cycle from one place to another within the city of Beijing, especially with the growing traffic jams. Since people travel further and more frequently than before, cars will certainly be important in the future.

{"answer": 1, "choices": ["A teacher.", "A librarian.", "A detective.", "A student."], "question": "One day in 1965,when I worked at View Ridge School in Seattle,a fourthgrade teacher approached me.She had a student who finished his work before all the others and needed a challenge.\"Could he help in the library?\" she asked.I said, \"Send him along.\" Soon a slight,sandyhaired boy in jeans and a Tshirt appeared.\"Do you have a job for me?\" he asked. I told him about the Dewey Decimal System  for shelving books.He picked up the idea immediately.Then I showed him a stack  of cards for longoverdue books that I was beginning to think had actually been returned but were misshelved with the wrong cards in them.He said,\"Is it kind of a detective job?\" I answered yes,and he became working. He had found three books with wrong cards by the time his teacher opened the door and announced,\"Time for break!\"He argued for finishing the finding job;she made the case for fresh air.She won. The next morning,he arrived early.\"I want to finish these books,\"he said.At the end of the day,when he asked to be a librarian on a regular basis,it was easy to say yes.He worked untiringly.

Alan Beck, an expert in human-animal relationship, and Nancy Edwards, a professor of nursing, are leading the animal-assisted study concerning the influence of robotic dogs on old people's depression, physical  activity, and life satisfaction. \"No one will argue that an older person is better off being more active, challenged, or stimulated  ,\"  Edwards points out. \"The problem  is  how  we  promote that, especially for those without friends or help. A robotic dog could be a solution.\" In the study, the robot, called AIBO, is placed for six weeks in the houses of some old people who live alone. Before placing AIBO in the home, researchers will collect baseline data for six weeks. These old people will keep a diary to note their feelings and activities before and after AIBO. Then, the researchers will review the data to determine if it has inspired any changes in the life of its owner. \"I talk to him all the time, and he responds to my voice,\" says a seventy-year-old lady. \"When I'm watching TV, he'll stay in my arms until he wants down. He has a mind of his own.\" The AIBOs respond to certain orders. The researchers say they have some advantages over live dogs, especially for old people. Often the elderly are disabled and cannot care for an animal by walking it or playing with it. A robotic dog removes exercise and feeding concerns. \"At the beginning, it was believed that no one would relate to the robotic dog because it was metal and not furry,\" Beck says. \"But it's amazing how quickly we have given up that belief.\" \"Hopefully, down the road, these robotic pets could become a more valuable health helper.

Sometimes they try to remember a solution from the last time they had a similar problem. They often accept the opinions or ideas of other people. Other times they begin to act without thinking. They try to find a solution by trial and error. However, when all these methods fail, the person with a problem has to start analyzing. There are six stages in analyzing a problem. First the person must recognize that there is a problem. For example, Sam's bicycle is broken, and he cannot read it to class as he usually does. Sam must see that there is a problem with his bicycle. Next the thinker must define the problem. Before Sam can repair his bicycle, he must find out the reason why it does not work. For instance, he must determine if the problem is with the gears, the brakes, or the frame. He must make his problem more specific. Now the person must look for information that will make the problem clearer and lead to possible solutions. For instance, suppose Sam decided that his bike does not work because there is something wrong with the gear wheels. At this time, he can look in his bicycle repair book and read about gears. He can talk to his friends at the bike shop. He can look at his gears carefully. After studying the problem, the person should have several suggestions for a possible solution. Take Sam as an illustration. His suggestions might be: put oil on the gear wheels; buy new gear wheels and replace the old ones; tighten or loosen the gear wheels. Eventually one suggestion seems to be the solution to the problem. Sometimes the final idea comes very suddenly because the thinker suddenly sees something new or sees something in a new way. Sam, for example, suddenly sees that there is a piece of chewing gum between the gear wheels. He immediately realizes the solution to his problem: he must clean the gear wheels. Finally the solution is tested. Sam cleans the gear wheels and finds that afterwards his bicycle works perfectly. he has solved the problem. What is the best title for this passage?", "subject": ""}

Many people feel sorrow about what they consider the over-commercialization of a sacred holiday, but, underneath all the business activities, a great deal of Christmas spirit is to be found. The custom of giving presents to one's family and friends is a very pleasant one so long as one remembers that it is the spirit behind the present which matters most and not the present itself.

{"answer": 1, "choices": ["Taking pictures of famous people in public places.", "Getting unsuitable pictures of a 10-year-old actress published.", "Following a famous woman singer secretly and taking her pictures.", "Hanging out at the places where celebrities often appear."], "question": "Paparazzi, or \"paps\", are photographers who take pictures of famous people when they are not at the center of public attention. Paps are different from professional photographers or journalists because they never take ordinary photos. The goal for paparazzi is to get pictures that no one else will get and then sell the pictures to the buyer who offers the most money --normally a small newspaper, magazine or website. There is no law against paparazzi taking pictures in public places. However, there are laws that protect certain individuals. For example, child protection laws stop improper   pictures of anyone under 16 from being published. There is also no law that stops paparazzi from following celebrities   and taking their pictures either. However, if paps are secretly following them and taking pictures of their faces, they could get into trouble. Most paparazzi hang out on streets and hot spots for celebrities, waiting for the opportunity to take a picture of a star. Many stay on the streets until the early hours of the morning when celebrities are leaving nightclubs and looking a little worse for wear. However, some have other ways to make sure they get pictures. Many paps are in contact with \"informers\" who know the locations of celebrities at any given time. They then pass the information on to paparazzi. An informer could be anyone --from a restaurant waiter to a salesman. Most of the time, paparazzi get a bad reputation for following celebrities. But sometimes stars or their managers will contact paps themselves and tell them exactly where and when they will go. What a love-hate relationship between paparazzi and celebrities! Which of the following things paparazzi might do would be against the law?", "subject": ""}

Its lift capability will be much bigger than that of the space shuttle of Saturn 5, the rocket that sent the Apollo missions to the moon. NASA is planning to launch its first unmanned test flight in 2017. It is hoped that the first crew will fly in 2021 and astronauts will make it to a nearby asteroid  in 2025. NASA hopes to send the rocket and astronauts to Mars from the asteroid by the 2030s, according to the Associated Press (AP).

Do you feel nervous when you sit a math exam? For most students, math can be tough but scientists have proved that math problems can actually trigger physical pain. Scientists came to his conclusion with an in-depth experiment, which was published in the Public Library of Science One journal. They began by finding out how much participants fear math. Those involved were asked a series of questions such as how they feel when they receive a math textbook or when they walk into a math lesson. Based on their answers, participants were divided into groups.

It was stressed from the beginning that the delivery date had to be less than six weeks from the first order, in order to meet our own customers'requirements.While we understand that delays in production are occasionally unavoidable,we must point out that the major reason why, the order was placed with your company was because we were assured by you of its speed of delivery, and that your existing stocks were sufficiently high to ensure immediate shipment.Late delivery of the goods has caused us to disappoint several of our most valued customers,and  _ have a negative effect on the potential future orders.     The second complaint concerns the difference in colour between the watches we ordered and those delivered.It was stated clearly in the original order that watches in combinations of green/purple and orange/purple only were required.However only half the watches in the delivery received are of the colours specified.Our Hong Kong agent assures us that she stressed to you the importance of following our instructions precisely, since we consider there to be only a limited market in this country for watches of other colours at the present time.Any watches that are not of ate specified colours will,of course,be returned to you.     We are also somewhat concerned about the rather poor quality of the goods received,since it is obvious that the watches that finally arrived have been produced from inferior materials and have been manufactured to a lower standard than those in the sample.We have also found that a number of the watches do not appear to be functioning.Whether the latter problem is due to poor manufacture,damage during transportation or bad batteries is not yet clear, but we should like to  point out that we feel this matter to be only your responsibility.     As a result of the above problem,therefore,we feel that the most suitable course of action is to return to you unpaid any of the goods considered unsatisfactory, and to subtract any  resulting costs from our final settlement.We shall also, of course, be forced to reconsider whether any further orders should be placed with your company.

It was stressed from the beginning that the delivery date had to be less than six weeks from the first order, in order to meet our own customers'requirements.While we understand that delays in production are occasionally unavoidable,we must point out that the major reason why, the order was placed with your company was because we were assured by you of its speed of delivery, and that your existing stocks were sufficiently high to ensure immediate shipment.Late delivery of the goods has caused us to disappoint several of our most valued customers,and  _ have a negative effect on the potential future orders.     The second complaint concerns the difference in colour between the watches we ordered and those delivered.It was stated clearly in the original order that watches in combinations of green/purple and orange/purple only were required.However only half the watches in the delivery received are of the colours specified.Our Hong Kong agent assures us that she stressed to you the importance of following our instructions precisely, since we consider there to be only a limited market in this country for watches of other colours at the present time.Any watches that are not of ate specified colours will,of course,be returned to you.     We are also somewhat concerned about the rather poor quality of the goods received,since it is obvious that the watches that finally arrived have been produced from inferior materials and have been manufactured to a lower standard than those in the sample.We have also found that a number of the watches do not appear to be functioning.Whether the latter problem is due to poor manufacture,damage during transportation or bad batteries is not yet clear, but we should like to  point out that we feel this matter to be only your responsibility.     As a result of the above problem,therefore,we feel that the most suitable course of action is to return to you unpaid any of the goods considered unsatisfactory, and to subtract any  resulting costs from our final settlement.We shall also, of course, be forced to reconsider whether any further orders should be placed with your company.      We look forward to your prompt reply.

{"answer": 2, "choices": ["Consumption of meat.", "Growth of cattle.", "Methane from ruminants.", "Processing of meat."], "question": "\"People should have one meat-free day a week if they want to make a personal and effective sacrifice that would help deal with climate change,\" the world's leading authority on global warming has told The Observer. Dr Rajendra Pachauri, chair of the United Nations Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change, said that people should then go on to reduce their meat consumption even further. Pachauri, who was re-elected the panel's chairman for a second six-year term last week, said diet change was important because of the huge greenhouse gas emissions   and other environmental problems associated with raising cattle and other animals. \"It was relatively easy to change eating habits compared to changing means of transport,\" he said. The UN's Food and Agriculture Organisation has estimated that meat production accounts for nearly a fifth of global greenhouse gas emissions. These are produced during the production. For example, ruminants  , particularly cows, give off a gas called methane, which is 23 times more effective as a global warming agent than CO2. Pachauri can expect some opposite responses from the food industry to his advice, though last night he was given unexpected support by Masterchef presenter and restaurateur John Torode. \"I have a little bit and enjoy it,\" said Torode. \"Too much for any person is bad. But there's a bigger issue here: where the meat comes from. If we all bought British and stopped buying imported food, we'd save a huge amount of carbon emissions.\" Professor Robert Watson, the chief scientific adviser for the Department for Environment Food and Rural Affairs, said government could help educate people about the benefits of eating less meat, but it should not regulate. \"Eating less meat would help, there's no question about that,\" Watson said. However, Chris Lamb, head of marketing for pig industry group BPEX, said the meat industry had been unfairly targeted and was working hard to find out which activities had the biggest environmental impact and reduce them. \"Some ideas were contradictory,\" he said. \"For example, one solution to emissions from cattle and other animals was to keep them indoors, but this would damage animal welfare.
