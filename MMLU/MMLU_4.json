{"answer": 1, "choices": ["the wind", "the old woman", "her mom", "her pet bunny"], "question": "Late in the evening, the wind blew hard around the little house. The sound of the wind is like someone crying. It made the old woman nervous. She had not been getting much sleep lately, but with the wind making the spooky noise, she didn't know what else to do but lie down and try to rest a little.  Once she lay down to try to sleep, many memories of her life in the little house kept her mind busy. She still was having trouble falling asleep. She remembered being a little girl and her dad putting the finishing touches on the house. Her mom loved the big kitchen, and she and her younger sister had their own room in the back.  It was in this, her old bedroom, that she was trying to sleep. The crying sound got louder. It didn't seem like it was outside. It sounded like it was coming from the other side of the bed. When she turned and looked, she saw her younger sister. She still looked five years old. The old woman couldn't remember her any other way, as she had died from a sickness at age five.  \"What's wrong?\" she asked her sister. \"I miss you. I am so lonely,\" answered the little girl, who was so thin you could see through her. The old lady closed her eyes and reached for her sister. That is how they found her the next day, holding her pillow and smiling.  \"She died in her sleep.\" \"It is best that way.\" Who did the younger sister miss?", "subject": ""}

Every day he would go out and find green things to cover his bed of old treasure. He would put grass and clovers and leaves and vines all over his cave. The other dragons were worried.  When you breathe fire, it's not a good idea to sleep around a lot of plants.  They were afraid Sean might get hurt. Sean didn't think so but his bed never stayed green and he was getting tired of doing nothing but making his bed.  One day he went to visit his friend Zarah and he saw a piece of green in a golden necklace. \"What's that?\" he asked.  \"That's a green stone,\" she told him. \"Sometimes my treasures have them. I don't really like them. They're too green. I like yellow things.\"  \"If I bring you yellow things, can I have it?\" Sean asked. \"Yes you can,\" Zarah said, \"But it has to be treasure, or things that won't catch fire.\"  So Sean went to go find treasure. When he was gone Zarah told the other dragons. They said that they would trade all their green treasure to Sean too so he could have a safe dragon bed in his cave.

Bob was the basketball star, Billy was great at football and Bryan was good at baseball. Each boy liked to watch the others show off their skills.  One afternoon Baker put on a magic show.  For this trick he would need three things.  First, he needed four cups each a different color.  The cups colors were green, yellow, blue, and white.  He would need one white ball and two helpers which the parents happily volunteered for.  He started by showing his brothers the inside of each cup as well as the normal white ball.  He then placed the white ball inside the white cups and moved them around really fast.  Next his parents covered the four cups with a magic blanket.  Baker said some magic words and then his helpers removed the blanket.  To his brothers amazement there were only the three colored cups left.  Each brother got to look under a cup.  After flipping up each cup they saw that there was no white ball.  Just a single green ball inside the green cup!  How did you do that they yelled!  A magician never gives up his secrets. How many cups were left after the helpers removed the blanket?", "subject": ""}

There were many things between the door and the seesaw that needed to be passed, and Mrs. Snooter's third grade class enjoyed the excitement that they added to the race.  First, the students had to pass the kindergartener's sandbox. This may sound simple, but the kindergarteners would often trap students by digging large holes in the sandbox. If students jumped over the holes, they might have sand thrown in their eyes.  If a student could pass the sandbox test, the next problem was the jungle gym. The fifth grade class came to recess before Mrs. Snooter's class and would hang out on top of the jungle gym. They thought they were cool because they were the oldest kids in the whole school, and would not let any other classes come near the jungle gym. It was difficult, but some students in Mrs. Snooter's class would make it past.  Finally, there was a long run to the seesaw. Only a few students would still be racing at this point, and they would run as fast as they could. Every day, there was one boy who would push himself a little harder than the other students.

Her big brother who had to babysit her was getting mad because she would not try new rides.  She cried more and more until one day she got brave.  She went on a little bigger musical ride that went around in circles pretty fast.  She got off the ride and loved it!  Her mom said to her, \"Okay, let's go on the big kid rides now!\"  Megan was afraid again and cried and cried.  For the rest of that summer she stayed in the little kid section and went on little rides.  The next summer her brother brought his girlfriend home.  His girlfriend's name was Sara and she was older, and loved big rides.  Megan liked Sara a lot and wanted to make her like her.  When Sara asked Megan if she would ride on bigger rides she said yes, and she went on her first real rollercoaster, Thunderhawk.  She was frightened at first but when she stepped off the ride she loved it like she had loved the other ride last year!  Now was the real test.  Sara asked Megan if she wanted to go on the biggest ride in the park.  She was afraid but wanted to show Sara how big she was.  At the beginning of the ride Megan was afraid and was about to start crying when they went down the first big hill.  Her stomach was tickled and she began laughing really loud.  She stepped off the ride with a huge smile on her face and was very proud.  Megan was no longer afraid of the big rides and enjoyed riding them for the rest of her life. Why did Megan finally got on the big kid rides?", "subject": ""}

{"answer": 3, "choices": ["To work on a farm", "To visit the stars", "To make shoes", "To fly"], "question": "There was once a pig named Oink, who lived on a farm, but spent most of his days in a factory making shoes. In his free time, he would make drawings about how much he wished he could fly. He would look up at the stars in wonder, hoping that some day, his dream might come true. For many years, his life carried on this way. He would wake up on the farm, go to work, and then come home to dream about flying. That is, until one day, he got a letter with a strange sticker on it, that was shaped like a star. He opened the letter in excitement, wondering what it said. The letter said that Oink was invited to a special party that took place every year in the clouds. Animals from all across the world were chosen so that they could know what it's like to fly. If he chose to go to the party, he would get his own set of wings to fly up into the sky and meet the other animals. Oink was so happy, he barely knew how to react. He accepted the invitation, and two days later, got a package containing his wings. Oink's dream was finally coming true. He put the wings on his back and flew up into the sky, where the party was being held. Once he arrived, he saw a bunch of other animals with wings also. He saw horses, dogs, cats, and plenty of birds. Oink had found out that it was the birds who had invited everyone, since they wanted the other animals to know what it is like to fly. Oink spent that day flying in the clouds with his new friends. But when the clock reached midnight, he knew his time flying was up, and he had to return the wings and go back to his farm. But the birds told him that they saw how much he enjoyed flying, and would allow him to keep his wings so he could fly with them whenever he wanted. Oink was really thankful, and next time he saw the birds, gave them their own pair of shoes for free as a thank you gift. What was Oink's dream?", "subject": ""}

There were new humans now. They took me in this thing they called a car. It scared me! Everything was moving so fast. There was another one of those different animals. I think the humans called it a dog. His name was Rex. The humans were very nice to me but the dog was not. He would chase me around the house. I would have to hide under the couch or in some other small space. I heard the humans talk about taking me some place else to live.       Next thing I know I am in the car again. I am living in another house. Uh oh! This house has a dog and other humans. This dog, who they call Sophie, was very nice to me. She smelled me and licked me like my mother used to do! We became close friends. I liked this new house. The humans were nice to me too. They had two small humans. Their names were Thomas and Nicole. I liked them because they like to play with me a lot.   One day a big truck came to the house and the humans put me in a room and closed the door. I was in there for a long time. When I came out all the human stuff was not there. They had put it all into the truck. I was scared again that I would have to go with new humans. This time, the humans took me with them! We moved to a new apartment in the city. I knew that these were not my humans. They loved me. They were my new family. What made Clyde scared?", "subject": ""}

The frog said, \"Oh, yes.  My name is Sammy.  I'm late for a very important meeting with my father, Ralph.  I was trying to jump over this puddle and caught my leg on that rock.\"  The kitten bent down and helped the frog climb on to her back.  She carried the frog all the way in to the city, to the place where he was to meet his father.  When the kitten entered the great room with the frog on her back, all of the frogs that were inside looked on in fear.  The frog quickly explained to them how kind and brave the young kitten had been in helping him make it to his meeting.  As it turned out, the frog was actually a prince and today was the day that his father was to pass rule on to him.  In reward for helping him, the new frog king made the kitten a princess, and they lived happily ever after as the best of friends. Why was the frog meeting his father?", "subject": ""}

He also told me not to get anything that has feathers included in it as his mom always gets headaches when she's around them.  My mom took me to the store and I looked around for something Tom would like. We had to pass through the clothing, medicine, and jewelry sections before we got to the toy aisle. My mom told me to not let her forget that we need to go to the garden section to get a new sprinkler before we go, but I was too into the toys to understand her. Finally, I found a board game where you play as different cars to try and finish a race first and thought that was perfect even without the dinosaurs. From there, we checked out and I gave the present to Tom on his birthday. He loved it and we played with our other friends, Daryl, John, and Angie. Sadly our other friend, James couldn't make it as he was sick, but we still had so much fun together. Which of Tim and Tom's friends didn't go to Tom's birthday party?", "subject": ""}

Finally, at the zoo Michael began to imagine how cool it would be to finally get to see the lion cage. First his class went to see the monkeys and then headed over to see the long necked giraffes. As their teacher announced that they would then be going to see the elephants, we wondered if he would ever get to see the lions. Finally after learning about the elephants it was time to see the lions. The lion stood on a huge rock and swung its long tail from side to side.

Aiming the football at the tire swing that hung in his back yard, he remembered the second thing his dad had taught him about throwing a football which was making sure his shoulder and the football were in a straight line before he threw it. He watched the football sail toward the tire, right as his mom called him in for dinner. His mom had made his favorite food, hotdogs. He sat in the kitchen and watched as ketchup fell on to his plate as he ate his hotdog. His mom told him that in order to get his after dinner treat he would have to eat his corn, carrots, and drink all of his milk too.   That night as his mom tucked him in to bed he starred out the window and wondered if the lions at the zoo were looking up at the moon too. Michael, wondered if his best friends Joe, Nick, and Ryan were as excited as he was about going to the zoo the next day. He closed his eyes and went to sleep.

They saw Robert in front of his house, but he said that he was busy and he could not play with them. Greg and Peter then thought that Lucy's idea was good. There was a large tree in the park. Greg, Peter, and Lucy walked to the park together.  When they got to the park, they were surprised by the size of the tree. It was much larger than they thought. At first, Greg was scared to climb the tree. But Peter and Lucy told him that it would be fun, so he began to climb. When he had climbed the first few branches, he slipped and fell down. But he was not hurt. After that, the three friends thought that it was too dangerous to climb that tree. So they all went home.  When Greg went home, his mother asked him what happened. She saw that his shirt was dirty. Greg explained about the tree. Then he changed into a different shirt, so that his mother could wash the dirty shirt. Why did Greg, Peter, and Lucy walk to the park together?", "subject": ""}

{"answer": 2, "choices": ["5", "17", "15", "12"], "question": "I'd had the piggy bank for a long time. So long, in fact, that I don't really remember getting it. My aunt once told me a whole story about it, in which it was passed down through the family for many, many years, only to come to me.

I would imagine my mom and my grandmother and even my great grandmother before that, putting coins in the little white pig and waiting for them to fill it up, to be spent on some sort of treasure. And then, when I was fifteen, I broke it.  I didn't mean to. I was cleaning my room in a hurry, so I could finish quickly and go to a friend's house. I swung the vacuum hose around too quickly, knocking the pig's shelf, and down it went. About a thousand pieces, and way fewer coins than I would have believed, flew everywhere. I started to cry.   My mother came in at the sound of the crash.  \"I'm so, so sorry!\" I cried. \"I broke the bank! I broke the family bank!\" \"What, Sarah?\" my mother asked, kneeling next to me on the floor. \"The what?\" \"The bank! Aunt Tracy said it was in the family for years!\" \"What, this?

The mouse waited until the farmer's wife, Julie, came out the back door, and then the mouse ran into the kitchen. There were bread crumbs everywhere! The mouse ate as many as he could before anyone found him. He heard the back door open again, and hid under the oven. It was warm there - there must have been a pie baking. Farmer Bill liked pies more than bread, cake, or cookies. The mouse stayed there to warm up, then ran back to the barn to sleep for the night. What was the bug's name?", "subject": ""}
