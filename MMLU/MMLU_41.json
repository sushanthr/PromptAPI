Previous studies have suggested that early risers are more likely to be happy and healthy while night owls experience worse sleep as well as more depression and anxiety during the day. For a long time, scientists have been trying to find out what causes the differences between the two.A new study suggests that it isn't just people's habits--early risers and night owls actually have different brain structures. Led by Jessica Rosenberg at Aachen University, researchers scanned the brains of 16 early risers, 23 night owls and 20 people with intermediate sleeping hours.They found that the brains of night owls had less \"white matter\"--which speeds up the transmission  of nerve signals -- in brain areas associated with depression. As you know, after people fly in an airplane from one time zone to another, they often suffer from a confused and tired feeling called \"jet lag\" because their body clocks are out of sync  with the new time zone.It usually takes about a week for their bodies to adjust to the new time.But night owls always have difficulty syncing their bodies to the right time due to their brain structure.\"It's like they suffer from permanent jet lag,\" said Rosenberg.

However, when students download and share copyrighted music without permission, they are against the law.   A survey of young people's music ownership has found that teenagers and college students have an average of more than 800 illegally copied songs each on their digital music players.Half of those surveyed share all the music on their hard drive  , enabling others to copy hundreds of songs at any one time. Some students were found to have randomly linked their personal blogs to music sites, so as to allow free trial listening of copyrighted songs for blog visitors, or adopted some of the songs as the background music for their blogs. Such practices may be easy and free, but there are consequences.   Sandra Dowd, a student of Central Michigan University, was fined US$7,500 for downloading 501 files from LimeWire, a peer-to-peer file sharing program.

People helping themselves to a cup of tea were supposed to put a few cents in the box nearby.

He had already passed sixty of the stages leading to it, and he had brought from his journey nothing but errors and remorse. Now his health was poor, his mind vacant, his heart sorrowful, and his old age short of comforts. The days of his youth appeared like dreams before him, and he recalled the serious moment when his father placed him at the entrance of the two roads --- one leading to a peaceful, sunny place, covered with flowers, fruits and filled with soft, sweet songs; the other leading to a deep, dark cave, which was endless, where poison flowed instead of water and where devils and poisonous snakes hissed and crawled. He looked towards the sky and cried painfully, \"O youth, return! O my father, place me once more at the entrance to life, and I'll choose the better way!\" But both his father and the days of his youth had passed away. He saw the lights flowing away in the darkness. These were the days of his wasted life; he saw a star fall down from the sky and disappeared, and this was the symbol of himself. His regret, which was like a sharp arrow, struck deeply into his heart. Then he remembered his friends in his childhood, who entered on life together with him. But they had made their way to success and were now honored and happy on this New Year's Night. The clock in the high church tower struck and the sound made him remember his parents' early love for him. They had taught him and prayed to God for his good. But he chose the wrong way. With shame and grief he dared no longer look towards that heaven where his father lived. His darkened eyes were full of tears, and with a despairing effort, he burst out a cry: \"Come back, my early days! Come back!\" And his youth did return, for all this was only a dream which he had on New Year's Night. He was still young though his faults were real; he had not yet entered the deep, dark cave, and he was still free to walk on the road which leads to the peaceful and sunny land. Those who still wander on the entrance of life, hesitating to choose the bright road, remember that when years are passed and your feet stumble on the dark mountains, you will cry bitterly, but in vain: \"O youth, return!

The days of his youth appeared like dreams before him, and he recalled the serious moment when his father placed him at the entrance of the two roads --- one leading to a peaceful, sunny place, covered with flowers, fruits and filled with soft, sweet songs; the other leading to a deep, dark cave, which was endless, where poison flowed instead of water and where devils and poisonous snakes hissed and crawled. He looked towards the sky and cried painfully, \"O youth, return! O my father, place me once more at the entrance to life, and I'll choose the better way!\" But both his father and the days of his youth had passed away. He saw the lights flowing away in the darkness. These were the days of his wasted life; he saw a star fall down from the sky and disappeared, and this was the symbol of himself. His regret, which was like a sharp arrow, struck deeply into his heart. Then he remembered his friends in his childhood, who entered on life together with him. But they had made their way to success and were now honored and happy on this New Year's Night. The clock in the high church tower struck and the sound made him remember his parents' early love for him. They had taught him and prayed to God for his good. But he chose the wrong way. With shame and grief he dared no longer look towards that heaven where his father lived. His darkened eyes were full of tears, and with a despairing effort, he burst out a cry: \"Come back, my early days! Come back!\" And his youth did return, for all this was only a dream which he had on New Year's Night. He was still young though his faults were real; he had not yet entered the deep, dark cave, and he was still free to walk on the road which leads to the peaceful and sunny land. Those who still wander on the entrance of life, hesitating to choose the bright road, remember that when years are passed and your feet stumble on the dark mountains, you will cry bitterly, but in vain: \"O youth, return!

{"answer": 1, "choices": ["It's mainly made from rotting plants.", "It's an environmentally friendly gas.", "Its production process is too long.", "It's easily recognized by the customers."], "question": "A town in Oxfordshire has become the first in the UK to have biomethane gas from human waste piped to their homes for gas central heating and cooking. Up to 200 families in Didcot now receive the gas via the national gas power system. Head of energy and technology at British Gas, Martin Orrill, said customers wouldn't notice any difference as the gas is purified to the highest standard and has no smell. The gas is produced at a sewage treatment works plant in Didcot. The entire process takes only less than three weeks, with the sewage being collected and sent first to settlement tanks. The solid waste material is then fed into digesters, where anaerobic bacteria digest the sewage, with the aid of enzymes to speed up the process. The digestion process produces methane, which can be burned to drive machines to produce electricity, or can be purified and fed into the gas network and piped to homes and businesses. British Gas says supplying the gas rather than electricity is far more efficient since around two-thirds of the energy is lost in producing electricity. Partners in the Didcot project, British Gas, Scotia Gas Networks, and Thames Water, all hope to expand the process to other towns, and other companies such as Ecotricity and United Utilities have also announced biomethane projects being planned. One of these projects, in Manchester, could be supplying 500 homes with biomethane by mid next year. Another British Gas project in Suffolk will provide gas from digestion of brewery wastes to around 235 families. The Didcot project cost PS2.5m and was influenced by promises of government aids aimed at encouraging companies to develop renewable technologies. An EU directive means the UK must ensure at least 15 percent of its energy is from renewable sources by 2020. The UK produces about 1.73 million tons of sewage annually.

{"answer": 3, "choices": ["the writer are fed up with them", "most people find them hard to tolerate", "the writer isn't prejudiced against them", "tolerating them isn't a virtuous act"], "question": "The word tolerance is widely used in liberal democracies. It indicates a positive meaning. Politicians urge us to be tolerant towards minorities. Educators teach us to be tolerant towards the other. The press is full of references to the need to display tolerance when faced with individuals or groups espousing a different view or holding a different religious belief. A tolerant society is an objective sought after by anyone who believes in the values of democracy. A tolerant individual is attributed with virtuous qualities. The question we must ask is whether we have been using the word tolerance fully aware of its meaning and whether we have applied it correctly to reflect what we really wish to convey? The word tolerance means to bear, or to bear with. If I tolerate something or someone, I basically say that I am ready to bear it or him. I can tolerate a bad smell or a noisy neighbour. The act of toleration forces me to desist from conveying my objection to the existence of a phenomenon, which I find difficult to bear. A bad smell or a noisy neighbour is considered by me to be an objectionable phenomenon. By tolerating either of them, I am not transforming the bad smell or the noisy neighbour into positive phenomena. Let's be honest: I don't have a different taste when it comes to bad smells. I simply dislike it and wish that it disappears. I don't respect the noisy neighbour. I would rather have him stop at once the noise he is making so I can live in peace. To try to remove the bad smell or take reasonable action in order for the noisy neighbour to stop bothering me would most probably not be considered an intolerant act by most people. Now, let's try to apply the word tolerance in reference to a person who is law-abiding and holds a legally acceptable different view from my own. I may have a strong view, which is opposed to his. Quite frankly, I may decide to tolerate his view. By so doing, I would be attributing to it a negative characteristic. I would apply the same attitude to his view as to the bad smell or noisy neighbour. Thus, to try to take action in order to make his view disappear would be considered an intolerant act. To tolerate his view the way I would a bad smell or a noisy neighbour, could hardly be considered virtuous. The subject tolerating is by nature not equal to the object being tolerated. If I tolerate you, I essentially say that I am above you and am prepared, although unwillingly, to bear with your presence or with your practices or opinions. That may be true in the case of an individual who is ready to tolerate the other. However, this attitude by such an individual, though empirically true, is hardly a virtue. Certainly, the fact that an individual, in reality, may merely tolerate the other or his opinion does not justify a government or any official authority promoting tolerance as a virtue. One cannot tolerate an equal being. True equality involves respect, not toleration. To respect the other as a distinctive person is hardly to tolerate him. This is the true meaning of equality: diversity existing in a mutually-respectful socio-legal setting. The danger with tolerance is that it can lead to the acceptance of individuals or groups bent on destroying the foundations of democratic systems. We have seen such cases with regard to political parties or destructive religious groups that have been treated in a liberal manner under the guise of tolerance. A tolerant attitude involves the grant of a favour, not a right. The question we should ask ourselves is whether we would ever wish a parliament to make laws according to us, as individuals and as part of a collective entity or a permission to pursue certain actions interpreted as a favour rather than a right? Indeed, would we ever wish anyone to listen to our views and accept us the way we are simply because he is kind enough to tolerate us?

And you won't be too tired! Active vacations are often the most relaxing ones of all. We don't expect you to take up jogging or backpacking. Rather, we ask the sedentary   vacationers to spend two to four hours a day doing things, such as walking in city streets, going to a zoo or biking beside the ocean.

Anyone can take the test for free. The new exam is called the EFSET, which is short for Education First Standardized English Test. The company, Education First, is known by the letters EF. It is estimated that there are two billion English language learners worldwide. Many of them are interested in attending an American college or university. To do so, foreign students need to take the Test of English as a Foreign Language -- better known as TOEFL. However, many foreigners are not wealthy enough to take the TOEFL. In addition, test-takers often have to travel overnight to reach an official testing site. The World Bank says an average Cambodian worker earns only about $1,000 per year. Approximately the cost of taking the TOEFL is 17.5 percent of the average worker's yearly wage. It is not just individuals who find the test pricey. Some governments also find it prohibitive. What's more, not everyone needs official results from the TOEFL or IELTS -- the International English Language Testing System. In the future, it's likely that the government may use the EFSET to test millions of employees and students. Experts believe that the EFSET meets the highest value in language testing. It uses special computer software that makes the questions easier or harder, depending on one's performance. The EFSET measures all the English learners' levels while the IELTS and TOEFL only measure learners' levels from moderate   to advanced. The EFSET is unique in the sense that it gives free online access to anyone interested in measuring their English level. There is a 50-minute and a two-hour version of the test, which its developers are calling the EFSET Plus. Both versions test only reading and listening skills. It's hopeful that speaking and writing skills will be tested in the future. The IELTS and the TOEFL still use humans to rate the speaking and writing sections.

In the future, it's likely that the government may use the EFSET to test millions of employees and students. Experts believe that the EFSET meets the highest value in language testing. It uses special computer software that makes the questions easier or harder, depending on one's performance. The EFSET measures all the English learners' levels while the IELTS and TOEFL only measure learners' levels from moderate   to advanced. The EFSET is unique in the sense that it gives free online access to anyone interested in measuring their English level. There is a 50-minute and a two-hour version of the test, which its developers are calling the EFSET Plus. Both versions test only reading and listening skills. It's hopeful that speaking and writing skills will be tested in the future. The IELTS and the TOEFL still use humans to rate the speaking and writing sections.

Anyone can take the test for free. The new exam is called the EFSET, which is short for Education First Standardized English Test. The company, Education First, is known by the letters EF. It is estimated that there are two billion English language learners worldwide. Many of them are interested in attending an American college or university. To do so, foreign students need to take the Test of English as a Foreign Language -- better known as TOEFL. However, many foreigners are not wealthy enough to take the TOEFL. In addition, test-takers often have to travel overnight to reach an official testing site. The World Bank says an average Cambodian worker earns only about $1,000 per year.

{"answer": 3, "choices": ["People write more memos than they used to.", "Staff leave messages lying around their offices.", "Many managers prefer to read their messages on paper.", "Many secretaries keep paper copies of their bosses' e-mails."], "question": "When e-mail first came into general use about twenty years ago, there was a lot of talk about the arrival of the paperless office.However, it seems that e-mail has yet to revolutionize office   communication.According to communications analyst Richard Metcalf, some offices have actually    seen an increase in paper as a result of e-mail.\"Information in the form of e-mal messages now floods our computer screens.These messages can be sent so quickly that memos  tend to be distributed in the hundreds.For those secretaries whose bosses ask them to print out all their e-mails and leave them in their in-trays, this means using up a great deal of paper every month,\" Metcalf says. Metcalf has found that because some e-mails get lost in cyberspace, important documents are     increasingly likely to be asked by clients and colleagues to send all important documents both by e-mail and by fax or \"snail mail\" - through the post.This highlights a further potential problem with e-mail in today's offices - it is taking up time rather than saving it.\"With e-mail, communication is much easier, but there is also more room for misunderstandings,\" says psychologist Dr David Lewis.Generally, much less care is taken with e-mails than with letters or faxes and the sender will probably print the document and reread it before putting it in an envelope or sending it by fax. More worrying is still the increasing misuse of e mail for sending \"flame-mail\" - abusive or inappropriate e-mail messages, Recent research in several companies suggests that aggressive  communications like this are on the increase.E-mail has become the perfect medium for expressing  workplace dissatisfaction because it is so instant. E-mail can also be a problem in other ways.Staffs all too often make the mistake of thinking that the contents fan e-mail, like things said over the phone, are private and not permanent.But it is not only possible for an employer to read all your e-mails, it is also perfectly legal.E-mail messages can be traced back to their origin for a period of at least two years, so you might want to rethink e-mailing your dissatisfaction about your too to your friends.The advice is to keep personal e-mails out of the office.      It goes without saying that e-mail exists to make Jife easier, and if used correctly, it is an invaluable tool for businesses of all sizes.But perhaps, for the time being, the fact that in the business world 70 percent offal documents are still in paper form is not such a bad thing after all. Why has the promise of the paperless office not come true in many offices?", "subject": ""}

However, many of us feel awkward when meeting people for the first time, especially when we aren't quite sure what to say. The situation feels cold, even icy. \"Breaking the ice\" is a term widely used in the English-speaking countries to describe a small talk technique that can help rescue a conversation from certain failure. So where do you even begin? Well, a good start is to accept that it is perfectly normal to feel a little nervous when talking to someone for the first time.

Finally, one night, I shouted at her: \"Don't do that anymore -- your hands are too rough!\" She didn't say anything in reply. But never again did my mother close out my day with that familiar expression of her love. Lying awake long afterward, my words rang in my mind. But pride overwhelmed my conscience, and I didn't tell her I was sorry. Time after time, with the passing years, my thoughts returned to that night. I missed my mother's hands, missed her goodnight kiss upon my forehead. Sometimes the incident seemed very close, sometimes far away. But always it appeared in the back of my mind. Well, the years have passed, and I'm not a little girl any more. Mom is in her mid-seventies, and those hands I once thought to be so rough are still doing things for me and my family. She's been our doctor, reaching for medicine to calm a young girl's stomach or ease the pain of a boy's injured knee. She cooks the best fried chicken in the world...gets stains out of blue jeans like I never could...and still insists on dishing out ice cream at any hour of the day or night. Through the years, my mother's hands have put in countless hours of toil, and most of hers were before automatic washers! Now, my own children are grown and gone. Mom no longer has Dad, and on special occasions, I find myself drawn next door to spend the night with her. So it was that late on Thanksgiving Eve, as I drifted into sleep in the bedroom of my youth, a familiar hand hesitantly stole across my face to brush the hair from my forehead. Then a kiss, ever so gently, touched my brow. In my memory, for the thousandth time, I recalled the night my surly young voice complained: \"Don't do that any more --your hands are too rough!\" Catching Mom's hand in hand, I blurted out how sorry I was for that night. I thought she'd remember, as I did. But Mom didn't know what I was talking about. She had forgotten --and forgiven --long ago. That night, I fell asleep with a new appreciation for my gentle mother and her caring hands. And the guilt I had carried around for so long was nowhere to be found.

Finally, one night, I shouted at her: \"Don't do that anymore -- your hands are too rough!\" She didn't say anything in reply. But never again did my mother close out my day with that familiar expression of her love. Lying awake long afterward, my words rang in my mind. But pride overwhelmed my conscience, and I didn't tell her I was sorry. Time after time, with the passing years, my thoughts returned to that night. I missed my mother's hands, missed her goodnight kiss upon my forehead. Sometimes the incident seemed very close, sometimes far away. But always it appeared in the back of my mind. Well, the years have passed, and I'm not a little girl any more. Mom is in her mid-seventies, and those hands I once thought to be so rough are still doing things for me and my family. She's been our doctor, reaching for medicine to calm a young girl's stomach or ease the pain of a boy's injured knee. She cooks the best fried chicken in the world...gets stains out of blue jeans like I never could...and still insists on dishing out ice cream at any hour of the day or night. Through the years, my mother's hands have put in countless hours of toil, and most of hers were before automatic washers! Now, my own children are grown and gone. Mom no longer has Dad, and on special occasions, I find myself drawn next door to spend the night with her. So it was that late on Thanksgiving Eve, as I drifted into sleep in the bedroom of my youth, a familiar hand hesitantly stole across my face to brush the hair from my forehead. Then a kiss, ever so gently, touched my brow. In my memory, for the thousandth time, I recalled the night my surly young voice complained: \"Don't do that any more --your hands are too rough!\" Catching Mom's hand in hand, I blurted out how sorry I was for that night. I thought she'd remember, as I did. But Mom didn't know what I was talking about. She had forgotten --and forgiven --long ago. That night, I fell asleep with a new appreciation for my gentle mother and her caring hands. And the guilt I had carried around for so long was nowhere to be found.

Spielberg based his film on parts ofTeam of Rivals, a book by Doris Kearns Goodwin.

In previous movies, Lincoln was shown as a simple yet almost perfect man. But Spielberg's Lincolnis different. \"I was determined to make a movie about a working president dealing with real problems.

In the movie, the arguments among political enemies seem very similar to the problems we see in Washington today. The disagreements were bitter. The film turns to Lincoln's relationships with his wife and kids, his beliefs and constant self-examination.

Even if you love sugar really much it is now time to learn a very important but also very little known truth regarding sugar. Sugar really has no benefits for your health and the only actual benefits from it are that it sweetens your taste buds and satisfies your sweet tooth. Sugar is not a natural substance and is produced through a special industrial process called refining  the sugar cane. Sugar cane has a lot of health benefits but in the refining process it loses all its vitamins, proteins, minerals and other nutrients which are essential. Therefore, you end up consuming empty calories only. Moreover, your body gets all the sugar it needs from the consumption of regular food such as bread, vegetables, fruits and so on. No added sugar is really needed. However, most people love sugar and simply feel like they need to eat food high in sugar. The latest researches show that the recommended intake of sugar which is healthy for your body on daily bases for children, men and women is as follows: *children-- 12 grams, which equals 3 teaspoons; *men-- 36 grams, which equals 9 teaspoons; *women-- 20 grams, which equals 5 teaspoons. The sugar intake when it comes to diabetics is a lot different based on the type of diabetes.

One day while shopping in a small town in southern California, it was my misfortune to be approached by a clerk whose personality contradicted mine. He seemed most unfriendly and not at all concerned about my intended purchase. I bought nothing, and marched angrily out of the store. My anger toward that grew with each step. Outside, standing at the corner, was a dark-complexion young man in his early twenties.

So we say: \"Love will find a way.\" As smile is a facial expression showing pleasure, affection, and friendliness, it is the commonest way to show our good will perfectly without saying anything. A Chinese saying runs: \"never hit a person who is smiling at you.\" It is a time-proven fact that the smile is a language all its own-- a universal language--understood by the people of every nation in the world. We may not speak the same tongue as our foreign neighbors, but we smile in the same tongue. We need no interpreter for thus expressing love, happiness, or good will. One day while shopping in a small town in southern California, it was my misfortune to be approached by a clerk whose personality contradicted mine. He seemed most unfriendly and not at all concerned about my intended purchase. I bought nothing, and marched angrily out of the store. My anger toward that grew with each step. Outside, standing at the corner, was a dark-complexion young man in his early twenties. His expressive brown eyes met and held mine, and in the next instant a beautiful, dazzling smile covered his face. I gave in immediately. The magnetic power of that shining smile drove away all bitterness within me, and I found the muscles in my own face happily responding. \"Beautiful day, isn't it?\" I remarked, in passing. Then, suddenly something inside me sent me turning back. \"I really owe you a debt of gratitude,\" I said softly. His smile deepened, but he made no attempt to answer. A Mexican woman and two men were standing nearby. The woman stepped forward and eyed me inquiringly. \"Carlos, he no speak English,\" she volunteered. \"You want I should tell him something?\" In that moment I felt transformed. Carlos' smile had made a big person of me. My friendliness and good will toward all mankind stood ten feet tall. \"Yes,\" my reply was enthusiastic and sincere, \"tell him I said 'Thank you!'\" \"Thank you?\" The woman seemed slightly puzzled. I gave her arm a friendly pat as I turned to leave. \"Just tell him that,\" I insisted. \"He'll understand. I am sure!\" Oh, what a smile can do! Although I have never seen that young man again, I shall never forget the lesson he taught me that morning. From that day on, I became smile - conscious, and I practice that diligently, anywhere and everywhere, with everybody. When I got excited in traffic, taking the right-of-way   from the other car with my stupid mistake, I'd smile and shrug my shoulders apologetically. This action on my part would always draw a good-natured smile in return. If the other fellow was at fault - and if I could remember my resolution in time! - he'd get a broad smile of understanding. This took a bit of doing at first. I'll admit it wasn't always easy, but it was fun. The results were sometimes amazing. Many times, a broad, friendly smile would completely turn aside ill-feeling and tension. I'm wondering now how many tragic accidents could be avoided on our overcrowded highways, if every driver remembered to smile! The best title for this passage could be  _  .", "subject": ""}

An emerald flashes deep green, a ruby seems to hold a red fire inside, and a diamond shines like a star. It's more difficult to tell where the gem was mined, since a diamond from Australia or Arkansas may appear the same to one from the Democratic Republic of the Congo. However, recently, a team of scientists has found a way to identify a gemstone's origin. Beneath the surface of a gemstone, on the tiny level of atoms and molecules , lie clues   to its origin. At this year's meeting of the Geological Society of America in Minneapolis, Catherine McManus reported on a technique that uses lasers   to clarify these clues and identify a stone's homeland. McManus directs scientific research at Materialytics, in Killeen, Texas. The company is developing the technique. \"With enough data, we could identify which country, which mining place, even the individual mine a gemstone comes from,\" McManus told Science News. Some gemstones, including many diamonds, come from war-torn countries. Sales of those \"blood minerals\" may encourage violent civil wars where innocent people are injured or killed. In an effort to reduce the trade in blood minerals, the U.S. government passed law in July 2010 that requires companies that sell gemstones to determine the origins of their stones. To figure out where gemstones come from, McManus and her team focus a powerful laser on a small sample of the gemstone. The technique is called laser-induced breakdown spectroscopy. Just as heat can turn ice into water or water into steam, energy from the laser changes the state of matter of the stone. The laser changes a miniscule part of the gemstone into plasma, a gas state of matter in which tiny particles called electrons separate from atoms. The plasma, which is superhot, produces a light pattern. (The science of analyzing this kind of light pattern is called spectroscopy.) Different elements produce different patterns, but McManus and her team say that gemstones from the same area produce similar patterns. Materialytics has already collected patterns from thousands of gemstones, including more than 200 from diamonds. They can compare the light pattern from an unknown gemstone to patterns they do know and look for a match. The light pattern acts like a signature, telling the researchers the origin of the gemstone. In a small test, the laser technique correctly identified the origins of 95 out of every 100 diamonds. For gemstones like emeralds and rubies, the technique proved successful for 98 out of every 100 stones. The scientists need to collect and analyze more samples, including those from war-torn countries, before the tool is ready for commercial use. Scientists like Barbara Dutrow, a mineralogist from Louisiana State University in Baton Rouge, find the technique exciting. \"This is a basic new tool that could provide a better fingerprint of a material from a particular locality,\" she told Science News.

{"answer": 2, "choices": ["increase sales in the male market", "help women learn how to play computer games", "encourage more women to buy computer games", "increase the number of male game players"], "question": "Computer games have been criticised for quite some time over a whole range of issues. Some people say they are overly violent and encourage violent behaviour particularly in children. Others say that they make children unsociable and are bad for their eyes. Some have even attributed falling standards of literacy and a lack of interest in reading on them. Now, however, it seems that computer games have also become a feminist issue. Game manufacturers have, for some time, been looking to increase the number of female game players. The vast majority of computer games still sell to a mainly male market. Perhaps this is because the violent nature of many of the games appeals more to males or perhaps because many of the main characters in the games are male. Manufacturers' attempts to produce more female characters increase their share of the female gaming market which has met with serious criticism from many women's groups. While heroines such as Lara Croft of the Tomb Raider game are seen as providing positive role models of strong women, many believe that the character's unrealistic Barbies  are subconsciously setting unattainable standards in the minds of young women.

Every day is a new day and a fresh start to learn, grow, develop your strengths, heal yourself from past regrets or hurts, and move forward older and wiser. Every day gives you a chance to reinvent yourself, to fine-tune who you are, and build on lessons of what you have learned. It is never too late to change things that are not working in your life and switch gears, instead of thinking in the same old ways, hoping for a different outcome. Be intelligent, be flexible, and keep and open mind to start each day anew! Flexibility is the key! Ask yourself: How do you wake up each day? Do you start your day going already feeling pressured and rushed? Do you go through the morning routine without much thought at all, doing what you \"have to do\" to start your day? How about starting each new day with a moment to stop, breathe and think of a positive intention for the day. Think not just what you want to DO, but how you want to BE today? Each day is a new beginning and a blank slate. How would you like to create your day? Think of it as a blank canvas -- what would you like to paint on it. What can you create? If you wake up in a negative mindset, you are more likely to paint a dark picture throughout the day, and your canvas will not reflect hope, happiness and joy. If you take each day to think positively, and have a positive intention for how you would like to create your day, how would your life be different? What positive outcome can reflect your positive intention? What can daily positive intentions do for you? Every day you will give yourself the gift of an \"attitude of gratitude.\" Visualizing how you would like your day will help release positive energy from within you and you will attract more positive energy from those around you. Instead of spinning your wheels in an old way of thinking, each day is a chance to reframe and re-look at things in a different way. You can experience each day an awe  in the beauty and creation of the world -- and the beauty of you who is in it! You find yourself shifting from an \"I can't mindset\" to an \"I can\" mindset. With a focus on positive intentions, you feel more empowered and more like a \"victor\" than a \"victim.\" You are more mindful of the present, and will be more likely to live fully in the present each moment of each day. After all, the past is a great place to visit, but you don't want to live there! So how about starting each day taking a moment to think of a positive intention for the day? Each morning, write it down and reflect each evening on how you did! Here are examples of Positive Intentions: \"Today I would like to replace my feelings of annoyance towards my co-worker to feelings of acceptance.\" \"I am looking forward today to focusing on what I am grateful for in my life, rather than what is missing, and express gratefulness to others.\" \"Today I want to slow my life down and take time to savor the moment, especially with my children\"..

Every day gives you a chance to reinvent yourself, to fine-tune who you are, and build on lessons of what you have learned. It is never too late to change things that are not working in your life and switch gears, instead of thinking in the same old ways, hoping for a different outcome. Be intelligent, be flexible, and keep and open mind to start each day anew! Flexibility is the key! Ask yourself: How do you wake up each day? Do you start your day going already feeling pressured and rushed? Do you go through the morning routine without much thought at all, doing what you \"have to do\" to start your day? How about starting each new day with a moment to stop, breathe and think of a positive intention for the day. Think not just what you want to DO, but how you want to BE today? Each day is a new beginning and a blank slate. How would you like to create your day? Think of it as a blank canvas -- what would you like to paint on it. What can you create? If you wake up in a negative mindset, you are more likely to paint a dark picture throughout the day, and your canvas will not reflect hope, happiness and joy. If you take each day to think positively, and have a positive intention for how you would like to create your day, how would your life be different? What positive outcome can reflect your positive intention? What can daily positive intentions do for you? Every day you will give yourself the gift of an \"attitude of gratitude.\" Visualizing how you would like your day will help release positive energy from within you and you will attract more positive energy from those around you. Instead of spinning your wheels in an old way of thinking, each day is a chance to reframe and re-look at things in a different way. You can experience each day an awe  in the beauty and creation of the world -- and the beauty of you who is in it! You find yourself shifting from an \"I can't mindset\" to an \"I can\" mindset. With a focus on positive intentions, you feel more empowered and more like a \"victor\" than a \"victim.\" You are more mindful of the present, and will be more likely to live fully in the present each moment of each day. After all, the past is a great place to visit, but you don't want to live there! So how about starting each day taking a moment to think of a positive intention for the day? Each morning, write it down and reflect each evening on how you did! Here are examples of Positive Intentions: \"Today I would like to replace my feelings of annoyance towards my co-worker to feelings of acceptance.\" \"I am looking forward today to focusing on what I am grateful for in my life, rather than what is missing, and express gratefulness to others.\" \"Today I want to slow my life down and take time to savor the moment, especially with my children\"..  Using each day to recommit yourself to positive thinking and intention will help you create the life you want and that you deserve! What can daily intention do for you ,except   _   ?", "subject": ""}

The only parenting issue that gave women less pleasure than it gave men was having to manage who does what for the child. On the whole, women's scores were 10 percent higher than men's. Women are also far more likely to take advantage of family-leave benefits to care for children. In the study, all the universities offered paid family leave, and 69 percent of the women took it, while only 12 percent of the men did.

{"answer": 1, "choices": ["His behavior didn't matter in the rescue.", "He didn't undergo risk in the rescue.", "He didn't want to make himself public.", "His travel to Prague was simply for a holiday."], "question": "Sir Nicholas Winton, rescuer of children, died on July 1st,2015,aged 106. When the letters and the honor came knocking on the door of his house in Maidenhead, and the filmmakers came calling, Nicholas Winton always protested that he was no hero. Heroes faced danger; he never had. They put their lives on the line; he had just worked at home in Hampstead, after a day being a stockbroker in the City. They avoided bullets and the secret police; he wrote letters, made telephone calls,and composed lists. The fact that he had rescued 669 children from Czechoslovakia just as the Nazis invaded did not, in his mind, constitute heroism. He hadn't gone out there in 1938 with any burning urge to do good; just for a holiday, in fact. Nor had he gone looking for children to rescue. Instead they and their parents had come to him, as soon as word got round that he might be able to help them leave Prague and get to the West. From 6.00 a.m. the knocks would come at the door of his room in the Europa Hotel, and he would open it to find some shivering, starving, desperate figure. When faced with a problem, his instinct was to solve it. So he made lists of the children, took their photographs, got them Home Office entry permits, found them foster families and organised their departure on trains, via the Netherlands, to Liverpool Street. After just three weeks in Prague, he went back to Britain and carried on the work from there. The British Committee for Refugees from Czechoslovakia gave him almost no help, so he took sole charge himself. The Home Office was slow with entry permits, so he copied some illegally. In search of foster-parents for the children he put their photos in Picture Post; in the hope of farther havens for them he wrote to governors and senators in America and even to President Roosevelt, to no avail. He could have rescued at least 2,000 more, he said later, if America had been willing to take any. A hero might have got involved in the stress and distress of individual cases. He avoided that by treating them like a commercial transaction: like the world he knew, in fact. A market was created, takers were sought and any likely bidder would do. Siblings were separated, if necessary. Jewish children  they were almost all Jewish  were often placed with Gentile families. Mr Winton did not care and he just had to get the children out alive and fast. When they arrived, exhausted, at Liverpool Street he seldom greeted them himself, preferring to stay calmly at a distance. Only one event traumatised him: the disappearance of 250 children on the last transport of September 1st 1939,as war was declared. But this awful thing too he stored at the back of his mind, realising that he had done all he could and his part was over. The scrapbook of lists, photographs and begging letters went up to the attic; he said nothing about it, and moved on. He liked it that way. The silent background suited him very well. For 50 years he sat on the Czech story, not supposing anyone would want to know, until in 1988 the scrapbook came to light and, with it, a blaze of publicity, culminating in an evening on Esther Rantzen's \"That's Life\" TV show when the whole audience suddenly stood up round him, applauding him,and every one was a child he had saved. It was \" ly awftil\",he thought; and wept with long-suppressed joy. He was still no hero, though, in his own book. He had had no desire to improve the world: indeed, not even much idea which job he was best suited for. At his father's suggestion he had tried banking first, having left Stowe with nothing much to show for it. After the war he dabbled in business,but it didn't take. In later years he worked for a mental-health charity and helped to set up homes for the elderly; and wondered why saving the Czech children was deemed more heroic than those things.

The woman, whose name isn't known, mistook a work of art by the German painter Gustav Metzger for a bag of rubbish, and threw it out with other bags. The plastic bad, which contained pieces of paper and cardboard, was later recovered outside the gallery, but the artist thought that it was too damaged to be put on show again. 78-year-old Mr Metzger explained that the exhibit, which he said was a copy of a similar work he had created in 1960, was meant to show that all art is temporary and \"finite\" . Embarrassed officials at the museum said that they had had to call a meeting with cleaners to explain which things should not be touched. They would not say whether Mr Metzger would be paid any compensation for the incident.

Mrs. Aldie Mackay, a local hotel manageress, might have thought that her eyes had deceived   her when she reported seeing a \"whale-like fish\" in the waters of the Scottish lake. Or was it made up by people? Dr. Charles Paxton, a researcher from St Andrew's University, noted that many of the 1,000 eye-witness accounts of the elusive \"monster\" he has been analyzing come from hotel owners. This raises suspicion   of an intention to increase tourism. Mrs. Mackay is widely regarded as the first \"modern sighting\" of the monster in the lake. And it has opened the floodgates. Police inspectors, lorry drivers, clergymen and fishermen were among the people who claimed to have seen the monster. It became so famous that it got a nickname: Nessie. Tourists and 'Nessie hunters' poured to the area. There were traffic jams around the lake. Certainly, there was much to be gained from the legend. According to Visit Scotland, Nessie tourism brings in more than PS1,000,000 to the area per year. Marine biologist Adrian Shine, who interviewed Mrs. Mackay years later, believes she was sincere. But there are plenty of people who have made a living from Nessie, including Mr. Shine himself. He now runs the Loch Ness Centre and Exhibition out of Mrs. Mackay's old hotel. Dr. Paxton says, analyzing the eye-witness accounts may tell us more about ourselves than whether or not the monster exists. He is due to publish the results of his study later this year. As a scientist, he casts a disbelieving eye on all the evidence linked to Nessie. Highly respected British surgeon, Colonel Robert Wilson, claimed he photographed the beast in 1934. It was later proved to be a toy submarine   with a sea-serpent head. Dr. Paxton says: \"I suppose it is possible that people have an agenda  .

Comparing that with his performance on December 19, also against Indiana, Yao won 29 points and 10 rebounds. \"This was one of the most exciting games I've had,\" Yao said after Houston's 95-83 victory. The NBA has to be excited about his on-count success. In all his games, he's averaging 12.7 points and 7.7 rebounds, quite good for a new star. \"Yao Ming has brought the NBA closer to the Chinese,\" said NBA spokeswoman Cheong Sau Ching, \"That makes the dream seem practical for other people in China and proud to be Chinese.\" The 22-year-old Yao is not the country's first player in the NBA: Wang Zhizhi broke down the Dallas Mavericks in November 2003. But Yao's combination of modesty and skills make him a favorite back home. Why does Yao Ming win more popularity than Wang Zhizhi at home?", "subject": ""}

It doesn't have to be that way. Health experts say you can still enjoy the holidays. \"It's OK to indulge , but it doesn't mean you have to gain weight,\" said Karen Ansel, a New York-based registered dietitian and a spokeswoman for the American Dietetic Association (ADA). Jessica Crandall, a registered dietitian from Denver who's also an ADA spokeswoman, added that gaining weight during the holidays and then working hard to lose it again is not good for a person's body. For starters, people interested in maintaining their weight during the holidays should keep eating on a regular schedule, the two dietitians said. Research has shown that people who skip meals -- particularly breakfast -- end up eating more throughout the day. \"Try and stick to consistent meal times so you can avoid being overly hungry,\" Crandall said. \"When you're overly hungry, you can make some bad decisions regarding what you eat. Don't starve yourself during the day waiting for that party at night -- because you'll eat too much or overeat.\" Ansel suggests that you think now about the foods you really enjoy and plan to focus on those while eating less of more common fare.

The door bell rings and there, on Ruth's doorstep, is an old woman asking for money to help the aged. She turns on the television, hears sad music and sees a picture of a wide-eyed child dying of hunger in Africa with an appeal for money to help the child. Ruth then goes shopping for a dress to wear to that evening's large party for the rich and famous.

Without treatment, a bad cut can lead to permanent damage. But how should a person know when a bleeding cut is serious enough to require medical attention? We asked Dr Martin Brown, chairman of the department of emergency medicine at Inova Alexandria Hospital in Virginia. First, the medical term for a cut or tear in the skin is a laceration(,). Dr Brown says the length is usually not as important as the depth. He says a long cut on a finger can likely be treated without a visit to a doctor if the wound is not very deep. \"If you have a short but deep laceration where there's been a structure underneath that's been damaged - a tendon, a nerve, a blood vessel,\" says Martin, \"it may, in fact, need professional attention.\" Some injuries - like a fingertip that gets cut off - might even require surgery to repair. That requires a specialist to either file  down the bone or _ the fingertip. More often, filing down the bone is what is done because reattaching a fingertip is often not successful. How a wound bleeds can be a sign of how serious it is. Minor cuts usually produce what is known as venous   bleeding. This means the blood flows steadily from the injury. The bleeding will often stop when pressure is put on the wound. Dr Brown says in most cases holding direct pressure with clean gauze or a cloth for four to five minutes should stop the bleeding. With a cut finger, holding the hand above the heart can reduce the loss of blood. But if a cut appears to be pumping blood out with some force, this may be a sign of arterial  bleeding. This kind of injury should be treated by a medical professional as soon as possible. Even a cut that does not require medical attention must be kept clean to prevent infection.

But Howie Choset sees in their delicate movements a way to save lives. The 37-year-old Carnegie Mellon University professor has spent years developing snake-like robots he hopes will eventually slide through fallen buildings in search of victims trapped after natural disasters or other emergencies. Dan Kara is president of Robotics Trends, a Northboro, Mass.-based company that publishes an online industry magazine and runs robotics trade shows. He said there are other snake-like robots being developed, mainly at universities, but didn't know of one that could climb pipes. The Carnegie Mellon machines are designed to carry cameras and electronic sensors and can be controlled with a joystick . They move smoothly with the help of small electric motors, or servos, commonly used by hobbyists in model airplanes. Built from lightweight materials, the robots are about the size of a human arm or smaller. They can sense which way is up, but are only as good as their human operators, Choset added. Sam Stover, a search term manager with the Federal Emergency Management Agency based in Indiana, said snake-type robots would offer greater mobility than equipment currently available, such as cameras attached to extendable roles. \"It just allows us to do something we've not been able to do before,\" Stover said, \"We needed them yesterday.\" He said snifter dogs are still the best search tool for rescue workers, but that they can only be used effectively when workers have access to damaged building. Stover, among the rescue workers who handled the aftermath   of Hurricane Katrina, said snake robots would have helped rescuers search flooded houses in that disaster.

{"answer": 3, "choices": ["They have to do more work since then.", "They have no chance to find better jobs.", "They have to work with inexperienced workers.", "They constantly worry about losing their jobs."], "question": "It is a familiar scene these days: employees taking newly laid-off co-workers out for a drink for comfort. But which side deserves sympathy more, the jobless or the still employed? On March 6, researchers at a conference at the University of Cambridge heard data suggesting it's the latter. Brendan Burchell, a Cambridge sociologist, presented his analysis based on various surveys conducted across Europe. The data suggest that employed people who feel insecure in their jobs show similar levels of anxiety and depression as those who are unemployed. Although a newly jobless person's mental health may\"bottom out\" after about six months, and then even begin to improve, the mental state of people who are continuously worried about losing their job \"just continues to get worse and worse\", Burchell says. Evolutionary psychologists support this theory by arguing that human beings feel more stress during times of insecurity because they sense an immediate but invisible threat. Patients have been known to experience higher levels of anxiety,for example, while waiting for examination results than knowing what they are suffering from-even if the result is cancer. It's better to get the bad news and start doing something about it rather than wait with anxiety. When the uncertainty continues, people stay in a nonstop \"fight or flight\" response, which leads to damaging stress. But not every employee in insecure industries has such a discouraging view,Burchell says. In general, women get on better. While reporting higher levels of anxiety than men when directly questioned, women scored lower in stress on the GHQ 12, even when they had a job they felt insecure about losing. As Burchell explains, \"For women, most studies show that any job-it doesn't matter whether it is secure or insecure-gives psychological improvement over unemployment. \" Burchell supposes that the difference in men is that they tend to feel pressure not only to be employed, but also to be the primary breadwinner, and that more of a man's self-worth depends on his job. Why do researchers think the still employed deserve sympathy more?", "subject": ""}

Brendan Burchell, a Cambridge sociologist, presented his analysis based on various surveys conducted across Europe. The data suggest that employed people who feel insecure in their jobs show similar levels of anxiety and depression as those who are unemployed. Although a newly jobless person's mental health may\"bottom out\" after about six months, and then even begin to improve, the mental state of people who are continuously worried about losing their job \"just continues to get worse and worse\", Burchell says. Evolutionary psychologists support this theory by arguing that human beings feel more stress during times of insecurity because they sense an immediate but invisible threat. Patients have been known to experience higher levels of anxiety,for example, while waiting for examination results than knowing what they are suffering from-even if the result is cancer. It's better to get the bad news and start doing something about it rather than wait with anxiety. When the uncertainty continues, people stay in a nonstop \"fight or flight\" response, which leads to damaging stress. But not every employee in insecure industries has such a discouraging view,Burchell says. In general, women get on better. While reporting higher levels of anxiety than men when directly questioned, women scored lower in stress on the GHQ 12, even when they had a job they felt insecure about losing. As Burchell explains, \"For women, most studies show that any job-it doesn't matter whether it is secure or insecure-gives psychological improvement over unemployment. \" Burchell supposes that the difference in men is that they tend to feel pressure not only to be employed, but also to be the primary breadwinner, and that more of a man's self-worth depends on his job.

The 26th version of Icehotel, which welcomed its first visitors on December 11th,features 69 rooms. To make them affordable for everyone, they range from expensive luxury suites to basic accommodations. Among this year's unique suite offerings is the\"Elephant in the Room\",which features a massive 3-m tall sculpted African elephant overlooking an ice--framed bed. The\"Counting Sheep\"suite features frozen sheep that may help those who don't sleep well get a good night's rest. Though the atmosphere between the luxury suites and the budget rooms may differ,they are all subject to the bone-chilling-5degCtemperatures. To get a good night's rest guests have to lie inside sleeping bags and keep their gloves and hats on. Though that seems a little uncomfortable,visitors say it is an experience like none other. The hotel also features a beautifully crafted ice church where over 100 couples will get married this year and an Ice Bar that will serve drinks in ice glasses. Though dining options are limited to the hotel's only restaurant,guests will have little to complain about with Michelin--trained chef Alexander Meier. To keep customers entertained,the hotel offers a variety of fun activities like snowshoeing,moose or snowmobile safaris,dog sledding,and even overnight wilderness camping.

A new cellphonebased tracking device from Hitachi can show, on an employer's computer screen, not only the whereabouts of their workers but also whether they are standing, walking, running--or have fallen over. The system, called Partout, was originally developed as a monitoring device for the families of people with dementia, who may wander off and need to be located. \"It's estimated that the number of elderly people with symptoms of dementia will reach 1.5 million in Japan next year,\" says Hitachi's Keisaku Shibatani.

Indeed, companies with large sales forces and police departments who want to track officers on dangerous patrol duties are interested in the system.

Indeed, companies with large sales forces and police departments who want to track officers on dangerous patrol duties are interested in the system. Partout uses a multifunction location sensing unit that tracks users through global positioning satellites. The user's body motion is determined by an accelerometer inside the sensing unit: no movement means the subject has stopped, slow movement means they are walking, fast movement means they are running, and strong and unexpectedly sudden movement means the user may have fallen. The date is relayed through the user's cell phone to computer, which displays their position on a map. Graphics record the motion or position of the subject's body.

Not a light shone in them and not a sound could be heard. It was one of the quietest places I have ever known, a bottomless well of silence. And above me was the full moon, which struck me deeply. Today our lives are filled with glass, metal, plastic and fibre-glass. We have televisions, cell phones, pagers, electricity, heaters and ovens and air-conditioners, cars, computers. Struggling through traffic that evening at the end of a tiring day, most of it spent indoors, I thought: before long, I would like to live in a small cottage. There I will grow vegetables and read books and walk in the mountains And perhaps write, but not in anger. I may become an old man there, and wear the bottoms of my trousers rolled and measure out my life in coffee spoons. But I will be able to walk outside on a cold silent night and touch the moon.

Investigators  say 68-year-old Mary Taylor lives there with her two dogs. \"I got out of bed and went to the front window and could hear somebody was yelling ,'Fire!'\" Curt Dworak said.When he realized what was happening, he threw on some clothes and ran to help. \"I was just hoping Mary wasn't in there, ,so I just reacted,\" he said, \"I just broke the glass and then went in through the window.\" Dworak yelled for Mary but got no response. As he searched,the fire grew and debris  started falling around him. I didn't know what to do. I yelled for her a couple more times,and then I heard her. Disoriented and unable to move, Mary was sprawling  on the floor in the back of her house,so Dworak picked her up and carried her to safety. Dworak, who has been as a hero by Green Bay Fire Department but shrugged of the praise,said,\"They would have done the same thing. Mary is a nice lady,and how could you live with yourself if you didn't do something like that?\" Mary was up and talking before she was taken to the hospital to be checked out.

There is at least one good reason for the desire to be attractive: beauty is power.Studies suggest that good-looking people make more money,get called on more often in class,and are regarded as friendlier.

It's difficult to describe it clearly,and yet we know it when we see it.And our awareness of it may start at a very early age.In one set of studies,six-month-old babies were shown a series of photographs.The faces on the pictures had been rated for attractiveness by a group of college students.In the studies,the babies spent more time looking at the attractive faces than the unattractive ones. The idea that even babies can judge appearance makes perfect sense to many researchers.In studies by psychologists,men consistently showed a preference for women with larger eyes,fuller lips,and a smaller nose and chin while women prefer men with large shoulders and a narrow waist.According to scientists,the mind unconsciously tells men and women that these traits--the full lips,clear skin,strong shoulders--equal health and genetic well-being.

It's a weekly tradition that my two little girls and I began years ago. Thursday has become our day to go out and make a positive contribution. On this particular Thursday, we had no idea exactly what we were going to do. At noon, I drove to a McDonald's with my daughters because they kept complaining that they hadn't had enough to eat at breakfast. There we saw some homeless people in the street and we bought lunch for them. We were about to complete when we found a small woman standing at the corner, asking for change. We handed her some food, and then started to head home. Suddenly from the mirror of the car, I saw the woman waving at us, so I had to turn around and stopped where the small woman stood. She walked to our car, and said, \"Thank you, lady! No one has ever done anything like this for me before.\" I replied, \"Well, I'm glad that we were the first.\" Feeling uneasy, and wanting to move the conversation along, I asked, \"So, when do you think you'll eat your lunch?\" She just looked at me with her huge, tired brown eyes and said, \"Oh honey, I'm not going to eat this lunch.\" I was confused, but before I could say anything, she continued. \"You see, I have a little girl of my own at home and she just loves McDonald's, but I can never buy it for her because I just don't have the money. But you know what...tonight she is going to have McDonald's!\" I don't know if the kids noticed the tears in my eyes.

The arrival of the American university on China mainland is an example of what is being called the \"globalization\" of education and it is hoped that this trend will influence the quality of education in all of China's universities by raising the standard of teaching. NYU Shanghai's class of 2017(students will graduate in 2017) is made up of 295 students from China, America and other countries. The students will study liberal arts courses for two years before choosing a major and when they graduate, they will receive a degree from NYU and a degree from ECNU. All the classes will be taught in English, using the teaching methods in American universities. Students will be pushed to take risks in the classroom, pushed to speak up and pushed to say things that are not completely correct, which can make them understand that it's OK for them to make mistakes in class. This style of learning will be challenging for many Chinese students, because they will be mixed with the foreign students both in the classroom and in the dormitory. Living and studying with foreigners day to day will provide Chinese students with a cultural as well as academic education and it's hoped that this cross-cultural experience will benefit them when they seek jobs in the competitive global market. China's interest in partnering with foreign universities comes at a time when western universities are trying to expand. They realize that information, technology and business are now borderless; they also realize education should be borderless too.

It has also been noted that a certain type of bees always provides five--never four, never six--caterpillars   for each of their eggs so that their young have something to eat when the eggs have hatched out. Research has also shown that both mice and pigeons can be taught to distinguish between odd   and even   numbers of food pieces. These have led some people to think that creatures can actually count.

Many people paid tribute to the former astronaut. But other people feel regret that no human has been back to the moon since 1972, just three years after Armstrong landed on it and gave his famous \"giant leap for mankind\" speech. Elliot Pulham, Chief Executive of the Space Foundation, thinks that America's space agency NASA should get more money, like in the 1960s, during the moon landings programme, when astronauts went to the moon. \"In this age of limited goals and tiny NASA budgets, Armstrong is a reminder of what our nation was once capable of,\" he said.  Armstrong died because of heart problems after surgery. His recovery seemed to be going well, and his death was a surprise to many people. His family described him as a \"reluctant American hero\" and said: \"Honour his example of service, and the next time you walk outside on a clear night and see the moon smiling down at you, think of Neil Armstrong and give him a wink.\" Speaking from the White House, Barack Obama said Armstrong was \"among the greatest of  American heroes - not just of his time, but of all time\".

He was the second man to walk on the moon. He said he was very sad at the death of his good friend and companion. \"When I look at the moon I remember that special moment, over forty years ago, when Neil and I stood on the moon,\" he said. \"Looking back at our brilliant blue planet Earth hanging in the darkness of space, I realized that even though we were farther away from Earth than two humans  had ever been, we were not alone.

We would go there to lie in the shade of trees and enjoy ourselves.   However, what I saw was completely different. The apartment building was now in disrepair. What was once more than a place to live looked hardly worth living in. The windows were all broken. The once clean walls were covered with dirty marks. The river was hardly recognizable.

Many argue that it is an effective deterrent   to murder , while others think there is no enough proof that the death penalty reduces the number of murders. The argument advanced by those who are against the death penalty is that it is cruel and inhuman punishment, that it is a mark of a bad society and finally that it is of questionable effectiveness as a deterrent   to crime   anyway. In our opinion, the death penalty is a necessary action. Throughout recorded history there have always been those peculiar persons in every society who made terrible crimes such as murder. But some are more dangerous than others. For example, it is one thing to take the life of another in time of blind anger, but quite another to coldly plan and carry out the murder of one or more people in the style of a butcher. Thus, murder, like all other crimes, is a matter of different degree. While it could be argued with some reason that the criminal in the first instance should be merely kept from society, such should not be the fate of the latter type murderer. The value of the death penalty as a deterrent to crime may be open to discussion. But the majority of people believe that the death penalty protects them. Their belief is proved by the fact that the death penalty prevents murder. For example, from 1954 to 1963, when the death penalty was carried out from time to time in California, the murder rate remained between three and four murders for each 100, 000 population. Since 1964 the death penalty has been done only once, and the murder rate has risen to10.4 murders for each 100, 000 population. The sharp climb in the state's murder rate, which began when killings stopped, does not happen by chance. It certainly shows that the death penalty does stop many murderers. If the law about death penalty is vetoed  , some people will be murdered----some whose lives may have been saved if the death penalty were in effect. This is really a life or death matter.

Unexpectedly, they saw an elderly man grasping for breath in the street.They tried to call the police and ambulance service, but their phones were not working, due to network problems. Before the Polish man became unconscious, the children kept him calm while they flagged down  a passing driver. The children used words they had picked up from their Polish classmates to translate the injured man's answers to the driver's questions.Gary,  10, and his six - year - old sister, Lily, stayed with the man while Thymus and Owen, both 11, led the ambulance to the spot where he lay. Soon the man was taken to hospital. The fantastic four children who came to the aid of the elderly man deserve the highest respect for their quick - thinking and courage in an emergency situation. They are a credit not only to themselves, but to their families and their school.And it is great to be able to hear such a positive story about young people. What is not so positive about this story is the fact that several adults apparently walked by without stopping to help.This seeming indifference to an emergency situation is a well noted phenomenon which psychologists sometimes refer to as \"the bystander effect\".Research suggests that when a group of people witness an emergency, people are likely to assume that somebody else  will intervene and they feel that the burden of responsibility is lifted from their shoulders.

Mr. Tito's journey was  certainly unusual! So was the transport he chose, and the price of his trip. The 60-year-old multi-millionaire from New York was sitting on board a Russian spaceship.  He was on a journey to the International Space Station. It might have been a routine trip for the  two astronauts who were traveling with him, but for him it was certainly no ordinary journey.  Dennis Tito was the first tourist ever in space, and he had paid the sum of $20 million to go there.  As the spacecraft left the earth's atmosphere, Tito drank a glass of fruit juice to celebrate and  looked down at the earth's blue-green surface. Two minutes later, he was sick. Luckily it was  only a minor problem. He soon recovered, and from then on enjoyed a smooth journey. When he  arrived at the space station, there was a big smile on his face. \"A great trip!\" he commented. \"I  love space.\" For a long time space travel was something for heroes. But all this is going to change.  Companies like ProSpace are investing large amounts of money in space travel. They want space  and space travel to belong to the public, not just governments. There are other plans, like voyages  through space from one side of the world to the other.

Many of these changes which he has brought about have had unforeseen consequences.Who would have thought that the throwing away of a piece of Canadian waterweed would have caused half the waterways of Britain to be blocked for a decade, or that the provision of pot cacti for lonely settlers' wives would have led to Eastern Australian being overrun with forests of Prickly Pear? Who would have prophesied that the cutting down of forests on the Adriatic coasts, or in parts of Central Africa, could have reduced the land to a semidesert, with the very soil washed away from the bare rock?

Studies on dolphins found that healthy dolphins switch into a diabetic-like state overnight when they are not feeding, but return to normal when they eat the following morning. The extraordinary finding has led scientists to suggest that dolphins have \"genetic switch\" that allows them to imitate diabetes while they are not feeding for a night, without suffering any ill effect. If researchers can identify a similar genetic pathway in human, they may be able to develop drugs to effectively switch off diabetes. Some 2.2 million people in Britain have type 2 (or late-onset) diabetes, a figure that is expected to reach 4 million by 2025 as a consequence of rising levels of obesity . The tissues of people with type 2 diabetes have become resistant to insulin  so they lose the ability to control sugar levels in their blood. The condition can damage the heart, eyes, kidneys  and nerves and contribute to 5% of all deaths, according to the World Healthy Organization. Dolphins appear to imitate diabetes to keep high levels of blood sugar when food is rare. Like humans, dolphins need some sugar in their blood for their brains to function normally.

Follow these safety tips to keep skating safe and fun. Step 1: Gear up! Even before you put on your skates, put on all your safety gear . Step 2: Buckle up! Strap on your skates. Make sure they fit well and are snugly around your ankles. This helps your ankles stay strong and straight. Step 3: Fall down! You probably do not usually try to fall. But it is good to practice falling on skates. Fall forward onto your knee pads. Put out your hands and let your wrist guards hit the ground. See? Are you surprised that it doesn't hurt? Practice falling until it is easy to fall forward and get up again. If you are not afraid to fall, you will try new things. Knowing how to fall will help you be a better skater and find your balance. When you can stay balanced, you won't fall as much. Step 4: Stop! Make sure you can stop on your skates. The quickest and safest is probably the brake stop. The brake is usually on the back of the right skate. The brake stop: Roll forward with your skates pointing the same way. Let your right skate roll a little forward. Bend your knees as if you are sitting down. Then press your right heel down hard. This will make your brake pad drag on the ground until you stop. The T stop: Roll forward with your skates pointing the same way. Then turn your right foot out so the toes are pointing to your right. Drag your right skate. Let the wheels drag on the ground until you come to a stop. Another way to stop is to run or jump onto the grass. Step 5: Roll around! Find a flat, smooth place to practice. Do not skate in streets.

To gain a better understanding of how cellphones and other mobile devices can measure our sense of happiness, the research team conducted a study that was published recently in the journal Demography. To gather data for their study, the team created an application for mobile devices using the Android operating system. Once the app was developed, the researchers invited people to download it and take part in their study. Over a three-week period, the research team was able to collect data from some 270 participants living in 13 countries. Participants came not only from the United States, but also from other nations like Australia, Canada, China, France, Germany, Israel, Japan, Norway, South Korea, Spain, Sweden and the United Kingdom. Over the course of the study, participants received occasional text questions from the researchers that asked \"How happy are you?\". Along with recording their response, the app used the mobile device's built-in GPS to keep track of the participant's location. The study participants were asked to rate their current state of happiness on a scale of zero to five. As they gathered data from the information collected through the application, the researchers then were able to create new methods that could help provide a better understanding of how our surroundings can influence our emotional well-being. The researchers learned that mobile devices can provide an effective way to quickly grab information that, because of today's active lifestyle, can be difficult to record. Being able to quickly grab this information was something the researchers felt was important. They said feelings and emotions that were recorded as they were happening were most likely to be more honest and precise than using other methods like writing down how they felt on a piece of paper after the fact. The best title of the passage is most likely to be \"  _  \".", "subject": ""}

Medical workers on board  collect blood from volunteers. The blood is then stored up and given to people  who have lost a large amount of it due to accidents or diseases.      Blood  is one of the most important substances   supporting our lives. But for now, the only way we  can get more of it is through donation. And donated blood has its own problems.  First of all, certain blood types are extremely rare. Type O negative blood  (O-), for example, only exists in 7 percent of people, according to Sunday  Times. There are fewer donors and therefore there isn't enough of this type of  blood for everybody who needs it. In addition, donated blood comes from various  people, which means that it has to be examined carefully for disease such as  hepatitis   and  HIV to make sure that it's safe for transfusion.      This  is why scientists all over the world have been trying to make blood in labs.  And now, someone finally succeeded--Marc  Turner at the Scottish National BloodTransfusion Service has produced  blood fit for transfusion, reported Forbes.      Unlike  many other scientists, who have tried to make blood substitutes by mixing   up different ingredients together, Turner chose to grow blood directly from  human stem cells  . He developed a special technique to create a chemical environment  similar to that in our bone marrow  . This environment encourages stem cells to develop  fully into red blood cell.      According  to Turner, his version of artificial blood is unlikely to contain disease  viruses or produce side effects. And the best part is that what he managed to  produce was type O- blood. Not only is it a rare blood type, it's also a  universal type, which means it can be transfused into any patient.      The  new blood is scheduled for human tests in 2016. However, Turner stressed that  the new study should not be taken as a signal for people to stop donating blood  because it could be another 20 years before the artificial blood can be  manufactured on a large scale. \"It is one thing to bake a cake and another  thing to bake a cake 100 times the size,\" said Turner. \"It's not just a matter  of putting in 100 times the ingredients.\" According to the text, a  potential danger of blood transfusion is that  _  .", "subject": ""}

However, Turner stressed that  the new study should not be taken as a signal for people to stop donating blood  because it could be another 20 years before the artificial blood can be  manufactured on a large scale. \"It is one thing to bake a cake and another  thing to bake a cake 100 times the size,\" said Turner. \"It's not just a matter  of putting in 100 times the ingredients.\" The study Marc Turner did is different from those of many other  scientists in that   _  .", "subject": ""}
{"answer": 2, "choices": ["Pessimistic.", "Doubtful.", "Cautious.", "Uninterested."], "question": "Everybody needs blood      Have  you ever seen buses on the street for donating blood? Medical workers on board  collect blood from volunteers. The blood is then stored up and given to people  who have lost a large amount of it due to accidents or diseases.      Blood  is one of the most important substances   supporting our lives. But for now, the only way we  can get more of it is through donation. And donated blood has its own problems.  First of all, certain blood types are extremely rare. Type O negative blood  (O-), for example, only exists in 7 percent of people, according to Sunday  Times. There are fewer donors and therefore there isn't enough of this type of  blood for everybody who needs it. In addition, donated blood comes from various  people, which means that it has to be examined carefully for disease such as  hepatitis   and  HIV to make sure that it's safe for transfusion.      This  is why scientists all over the world have been trying to make blood in labs.  And now, someone finally succeeded--Marc  Turner at the Scottish National BloodTransfusion Service has produced  blood fit for transfusion, reported Forbes.      Unlike  many other scientists, who have tried to make blood substitutes by mixing   up different ingredients together, Turner chose to grow blood directly from  human stem cells  . He developed a special technique to create a chemical environment  similar to that in our bone marrow  . This environment encourages stem cells to develop  fully into red blood cell.      According  to Turner, his version of artificial blood is unlikely to contain disease  viruses or produce side effects. And the best part is that what he managed to  produce was type O- blood.

When squeezing past someone in a narrow aisle, people say \"sorry\". When getting off a bus, English passengers say \"thank you\" rather than the driver. In Germany, people would never dream of doing these things. After all, squeezing past others is sometimes unavoidable, and the bus driver is only doing his job. I used to think the same way, without questioning it, until I started traveling to the British Isles and came to appreciate some more polite ways of interacting   with people. People thank each other everywhere in England, all the time. When people buy something in a shop, customers and retail assistants in most cases thank each other twice or more. In Germany, it would be exceptional to hear more than one \"thank you\" in such a conversation. British students thank their lecturers when leaving the room. English employers thank their employees for doing their jobs, as opposite to Germans, who would normally think that paying their workers money is already enough. Another thing I observed during my stay was that English people rarely criticize others. Even when I was working and mistakes were pointed out to me, my employers emphasized   several times that none of their words were intended as criticism. It has been my impression that by avoiding criticism, English people are making an effort to make others feel comfortable. This is also shown in other ways.

A recent report by Britain's Independent Institute of Manpower Studies, however, disagrees with this. The report states that most employers wish to avoid employing the wrong person.

The report also suggests that in Britain and in many other parts of the world the selection methods used to pick out the right person for the job certainly do not match up to those used to judge a piece of new equipment.

Most of the employers asked in this survey stated that these selection methods were used more for weeding out unsuitable applicants rather than for finding suitable ones. Interviews were considered to be more reliable than either resume checks or references from past employers. Research, however, proves otherwise. Interviewers' decisions are often strongly influenced by their earlier judgment of the written application. Also different employers view facts differently.

The researchers said previous theories about how we appreciate music were based on the physical functions of sound, the ear itself and a born ability to hear harmony. The study shows that musical harmony can be learnt, and it is a matter of training the brain to hear the sounds. So if you thought that the music of some foreign culture (or Jazz) sounded like the crying of cats, it's simply because you haven't learnt to listen by their rules. The researchers used 66 volunteers with a range of   musical training and tested their ability to hear combinations   of notes   to determine if they found the combinations familiar or pleasing. They found that people needed to be familiar with combinations of notes. If they couldn't recognize the notes, they found the notes _ . This finding put an end to centuries of theories claiming   that physical functions of the ear determine what we find attractive. The study found that trained musicians were much more sensitive   to unpleasant notes than non-musicians. When they couldn't find the note, the musicians reported that the sounds were unpleasant, while non-musicians were much less sensitive. This shows the importance of training or nurturing   the brain to like particular sound of combinations of notes, like those found in jazz or rock. Depending on their training, a strange chord   sound was pleasant to some musicians, but very unpleasant to others. This showed us that even the ability to hear a musical note is learnt. To confirm   this finding, they trained 19 non-musicians to find the notes of a random   selection of western chords. Not only did the participants' ability to hear notes improve rapidly; the chords they had learnt sounded more pleasant--regardless of   how the chords were played.

{"answer": 3, "choices": ["by analyzing some facts", "by giving some examples", "from the angle of biology", "from the angle of psychology"], "question": "Sensing phantom phone vibrations  is a strangely common experience. Around 80% of us have imagined a phone vibrating in our pockets when it's actually completely still. Almost 30% of us have also heard non-existent ringing. Are these signs of madness caused by digital culture? Not at all. In fact, phantom vibrations and ringing indicate a fundamental principle in psychology. Psychologists use a concept called Signal Detection Theory to guide their thinking about the problem of perceptual  judgments. Working through the example of phone vibrations, we can see how this theory explains why they are a common and unavoidable part of healthy mental function. When your phone is in your pocket, the world is in one of two possible states: the phone is either ringing or not. You also have two possible states of mind: the judgment that the phone is ringing, or the judgment that it isn't. Obviously you'd like to match these states in the correct way. True vibrations should go with \"it's ringing\", and no vibrations should go with \"it's not ringing\". Signal detection theory calls these faithful matches a \"hit\" and a \"correct rejection\" But there are two other possible combinations: you could mismatch true vibrations with \"it's not ringing\" (a \"miss\"); or mismatch the absence of vibrations with \"it's ringing\" (a \"false alarm\"). This second kind of mismatch is what's going on when you imagine a phantom phone vibration. What does that mean in terms of your phone? We can assume that people like to notice when their phone is ringing, and that most people hate missing a call.

Around 80% of us have imagined a phone vibrating in our pockets when it's actually completely still. Almost 30% of us have also heard non-existent ringing. Are these signs of madness caused by digital culture? Not at all. In fact, phantom vibrations and ringing indicate a fundamental principle in psychology. Psychologists use a concept called Signal Detection Theory to guide their thinking about the problem of perceptual  judgments. Working through the example of phone vibrations, we can see how this theory explains why they are a common and unavoidable part of healthy mental function. When your phone is in your pocket, the world is in one of two possible states: the phone is either ringing or not. You also have two possible states of mind: the judgment that the phone is ringing, or the judgment that it isn't. Obviously you'd like to match these states in the correct way. True vibrations should go with \"it's ringing\", and no vibrations should go with \"it's not ringing\". Signal detection theory calls these faithful matches a \"hit\" and a \"correct rejection\" But there are two other possible combinations: you could mismatch true vibrations with \"it's not ringing\" (a \"miss\"); or mismatch the absence of vibrations with \"it's ringing\" (a \"false alarm\"). This second kind of mismatch is what's going on when you imagine a phantom phone vibration. What does that mean in terms of your phone?

The region, which lies just behind the right ear, becomes more active when we think about other people's misdemeanor or good work.   In an experiment, researchers were able to use powerful magnets   to disrupt   this area of the brain and make people temporarily less moral. The study discovers that our sense of right and wrong isn't just based on upbringing, religion or philosophy --but also by the biology of our brains. The researchers used a non-harmful technique to disrupt the area of the brain. The technique produce a magnetic field on a small part of the brain which creates weak electric currents in the brain. These currents interfere with nearby brain cells and prevent them from firing normally. One story described a man who let his girlfriend walk over a bridge he knew was unsafe. The girl survived unharmed. Under normal conditions, most people rate the man's behavior as unacceptable. But after getting the magnetic pulse, the volunteers tended to see nothing wrong with his action --and judged his behavior purely on whether his girlfriend survived. Another story described two girls visiting a chemical plant where one girl asks her friend to put sugar in her coffee. The friend uses powder from a jar marked toxic   -- but as the powder turns out to be sugar. Volunteers with a disrupted moral compass tended to rate the girl's behavior as permissible because her friend was not injured--even though she was aware the powder came from a jar labeled toxic. Throughout the experiment, irresponsible or deliberate  actions that might have resulted in harm were seen as morally acceptable if the story had a \"happy ending\".

Visitors can play on the beach with sea lions and giant sea turtles, swim with dolphins and whales, and get close enough to the penguins to count the eggs in their nests. The islands were declared a national park over 40 years ago, and the number of human visitors is tightly limited to avoid damaging he environment or putting stress on the animal. Tourists have to pay a $100 daily visitors fee, and can't step off the boat unless accompanied  by an official guide. Once on the islands, you have to stay on the trail , but that seldom presents a problem: the animals are so curious about people that they'll usually come up to say hello. \"It's a little like being in a zoo,\" said one traveler. \"But instead of us looking at the animals, the animals, the animals are looking at us.\" Aside from the wildlife, one of the island' more unusual features is its post office. You can send postcards for free, but the problem is that there's no postman to collect them. Instead, travelers pick up mail addressed to people who live near them back home, and then hand-deliver the postcards when their trip is finished.

Twenty years ago, Oliver's back injury ruined her childhood dream of becoming a ballet dancer. But the injury did lead her to t'ai chi, a martial art   typically practiced in slow motion. Her initial hope was to improve her health. She later married her instructor, Rey Nelson, and founded a school with him, teaching the martial art to more than 10, 000 students over eight years.

I thought I had to find some way to recover my health.\" Oliver saw a poster for a t'ai chi class and decided to try the\"mysterious exotic sport\". She was struck by the beautiful movements and the\"nice, patient instructor -- Nelson\". The couple later opened a t'ai chi school in the United Kingdom that attracted thousands of people. But they found themselves in a bottleneck. \"It was not enough for us to improve ourselves when we just learned from t'ai chi masters for two or four weeks a year,\"she says. So the couple moved to Shanghai. They taught English in universities and happily learned t'ai chi under various masters. After years of practice, Oliver found her occasional backaches had disappeared. In 2003, her husband's death brought her much pain. She thought of giving up, but considering the career in which her husband took pride, she stuck to it. She says her t'ai chi\"family\"-- the masters and students -- also provided a great support network. Her then tutor was Dong Bing and Dong died in 2009 at the age of 88. She speaks of their first meeting:\"I had been told that his skill was of a very high level and for some reason I had a mental image of a powerful, big man. But my fellow pointed to a small, thin old gentleman, sitting on the ground. \"I felt amazed as I realized that this was the master himself, and then a sudden feeling of pleasure hit me. Of course this was exactly the kind of person who would be a t'ai chi master -- the last person you could imagine. \"I learned attentively from him. He did not only teach me physically t'ai chi but also the philosophy of how to be a better person, how to keep going when you felt you were tired. \"His idea is that one should not pursue wealth and fame but endeavor to be happy and share one's knowledge and wisdom with others.\" Following the master, Oliver learned to live a simple life -- one perhaps more traditional than many Chinese. She does t'ai chi in the morning and makes kung fu tea for guests. Ink-wash bamboo paintings hang on her apartment walls. Oliver spends her time outside t'ai chi teaching English and attending cultural exchange events. She founded the Double Dragon Alliance in 2005. The organization enables Chinese kung fu masters to teach martial arts to Westerners and organizes seminars and events for them to experience Chinese massage , acupuncture , traditional medicine, calligraphy  and tea ceremonies. Because of her contribution to cultural exchange, Oliver was given the Shanghai Magnolia Award on Sept 30, 2013.

Whether the remedy  comes from the warmth and comfort of the soup or from actual cold-fighting ingredients  in the meal, it is still up for debate. Chicken Soup: Just the Evidence  _ The heat, salt, and hydration provided by chicken soup may actually fight the cold virus. Laboratory studies have shown that ingredients of chicken soup with vegetables could kill viral cells and prevent the growth of new ones. The soup may also provide an anti-inflammatory  effect that helps reduce cold symptoms. Unfortunately, the benefits of chicken soup appear to be limited by how quickly the soup leaves the body. There is no indication that chicken soup would help in the prevention of colds, but its use as a remedy for symptoms is common. It is largely a safe remedy  with no ill side effects, and scientific evidence points more in favor of its cold-fighting properties  than against it. The Downside of Chicken Soup Evidence in support of chicken soup's antiviral properties is not yet solid enough to prove true, reliable medicinal effects. Although the evidence based on personal experiences and existing research seem to support a good effect of chicken soup, a clinical trial would be very difficult to perform.

At least another 14 isolated tribes, with a total population of about 2000, call the area home. The newly observed group lives on four large straw-roofed buildings and grows corn, peanut and other crops. Brazil's National Indian Foundation (BNTF) first noticed the reservation in the forest using satellite maps, but it wasn't until April that an airplane expedition was able to confirm the tribe's existence. \"The work of finding and protecting isolated groups is part of Brazilian public policy,\" said the BNIF officer for Vale do Javari, Fabricio Amorim. \"To confirm something like this takes years of hard work.\" BNIF estimates there are 68 isolated tribes living in the Amazon. The organization uses airplanes to avoid disturbing the tribes through personal contact, but that doesn't mean others are so respectful of their right to privacy. Illegal fishing, woodcutting and hunting bring people into the protected area. Oil exploration on the Peruvian side of the border is another threat. All kinds of criminals also invade the lands of the local groups, said Amorim. The outsiders can damage the land and influence the cultures of indigenous peoples. They can also bring diseases which can wipe out the whole population that still lack even basic antibiotics .

For most Americans, it prompted a time of rejoicing, a magnificent sense of closure, and a feeling that justice had been done. But for those who were followers of bin Laden, there was anger, heightened feelings of revenge , and a deep sense of loss. How do we make meaning from such a moment in history? And how do we help children understand the deep values that unite us as a nation? This is indeed a teachable moment for families and for classrooms around the country. Reactions to murder can be very confusing to children because they are not able to morally reason like adults. Instead of understanding his killing as an act of justice, children may interpret it as an act of revenge. They can internalize joyful reactions to mean\"When someone harms me or my family, it is okay to hurt them back.\"Talking with children about this event is an important lesson in moral development. Adults can help children understand justice and revenge by talking about the values behind these two concepts. There are sticky issues here -- and sometimes there are no concrete answers! Getting kids to reflect on and discuss moral dilemmas is important to development. Justice is understood differently by different cultures, depending upon their history. At the core of justice are certain shared values about moral rightness, fairness, and ethics that ifbreachedpunishment will follow. Justice is an integral part of the American legal system, a foundation of how our culture thinks about crime and punishment. Justice is about how our actions have consequences. John Stuart Mill, a British philosopher, suggested that justice evolved from two natural human tendencies: revenge and empathy. Humans have natural empathy for people who are hurt. Indeed, the human loss from 9*11 was overwhelming to everyone, not just those who lost loved ones. Through our ability to put ourselves into another person's place, we feel a natural desire to revenge on those who hurt us. Thus, Mill believed the laws of justice evolved from the difference between empathy and revenge. What is the difference between justice and revenge? Justice is undertaken and supported by legitimate judicial systems founded on certain ethics and morals. It is meant to be restorative. On the other hand, revenge is often done to make others suffer the same or greater pain than that which was originally inflicted. It can be argued that the type of killing done by al-Qaeda is steeped in revenge because it is designed to inflict the greatest harm on innocent people. Helping children understand the meaning of justice and its underlying values is important. It develops a child's ability to develop skills in moral reasoning. And it helps them distinguish between concepts such as justice and revenge. When they are faced with their own moral dilemmas, they will be able to respond. An event like bin Laden's death and the intense emotions surrounding the event of 9*11 are different for each American household. Talk to your children about your feelings. Ask them about theirs.

Do not try to do too many things at once. Also,you can group similar activities together and do them one by one. For example, you can group all the tasks you need to do in the office together and do them while you're in office. Do all the tasks that have to be done in one place first, and then move to the next place to do the other tasks. \"The bad news is that time flies.

If I had to take a guess, you probably celebrate New Year's Day surrounded by family and friends, enjoying drinks of your choice (probably wine and champagne) and watching the ball drop.

Listed below are five of the top ten \"Unique New Year Traditions from Around the World.\" 1. Breaking Dishes on Neighbor's Door----Denmark A strange and weird Danish New Year tradition, depending on how you look at it, is throwing dishes at neighbor's door. Strangely, this makes them happy instead of annoying them. The family with the tallest tower of broken plates, glasses, cups and other crockery is considered to be the luckiest person because it symbolizes their large amount of loyal friends. 2. Talking to Spirits----Mexico Talking to spirits is a part of Mexican belief. Mexicans strongly believe that they can communicate with the souls of their dead loved ones. New Year's Eve is considered the best time to communicate with dead spirits to convey a message or ask for guidance. And this is not done at home on an individual basis but is a legal Mexican practice. Taos Inn, in New Mexico for example, offers 15 minutes session of spiritualism and meditation  for $15. Not a bad price for some helpful guidance! 3. Wearing Polka Dots ----Philippines Imagine streets full of people wearing polka dots and dining room tables full of round shaped food and fruits on one single day of the year. This all actually happens in the Philippines on New Year's Eve every year. Philippines believe that this will bring them prosperity by associating the round dots to coins and wealth. 4. Burning Scarecrow  Dummy----Ecuador Ecuador has a unique custom of crafting scarecrows and then burning them at midnight. They adorn them and fill the scarecrows with newspapers and pieces of wood. As midnight approaches, everyone gathers outside their home and each family burns their own scarecrow. The tradition says that this destroys all the bad things that took place in the past 12 months. The scarecrow also scares away bad luck, which in turn, fills their new year with luck and happiness. 5. Mistletoe  Leaves Are Placed Under Pillow to Find Husband----Ireland The single women of Ireland wait desperately for New Year's Eve because it is the night that can bring them the love of their lives. They place mistletoe leaves under their pillow hoping to catch their future husband. It is also believed in the Irish culture that this act will help them get rid of bad luck.

New Year's Eve is considered the best time to communicate with dead spirits to convey a message or ask for guidance. And this is not done at home on an individual basis but is a legal Mexican practice. Taos Inn, in New Mexico for example, offers 15 minutes session of spiritualism and meditation  for $15. Not a bad price for some helpful guidance! 3. Wearing Polka Dots ----Philippines Imagine streets full of people wearing polka dots and dining room tables full of round shaped food and fruits on one single day of the year. This all actually happens in the Philippines on New Year's Eve every year. Philippines believe that this will bring them prosperity by associating the round dots to coins and wealth. 4. Burning Scarecrow  Dummy----Ecuador Ecuador has a unique custom of crafting scarecrows and then burning them at midnight. They adorn them and fill the scarecrows with newspapers and pieces of wood. As midnight approaches, everyone gathers outside their home and each family burns their own scarecrow. The tradition says that this destroys all the bad things that took place in the past 12 months. The scarecrow also scares away bad luck, which in turn, fills their new year with luck and happiness. 5. Mistletoe  Leaves Are Placed Under Pillow to Find Husband----Ireland The single women of Ireland wait desperately for New Year's Eve because it is the night that can bring them the love of their lives. They place mistletoe leaves under their pillow hoping to catch their future husband. It is also believed in the Irish culture that this act will help them get rid of bad luck. The world is a large and very different place. Yes, people of all nations may celebrate New Year's much differently around the world, with different traditions, but there are a lot of general themes to be seen. We all want to start a new, fresh year with renewed enthusiasm and hope no matter what happened during the past year. We all want to be happier, find love, renew friendships increase our wealth and also hope for a little extra luck in the coming New Year. The single women of Ireland always   _   hoping to catch their future husband on New Year's Eve.", "subject": ""}

It is called Bronner's Christmas Wonderland in Frankenmuth, Michigan. The family-owned business calls itself the world's largest Christmas store. The late Wally Bronner started the business in 1945. Wayne Bronner, Wally's son, is president and CEO of what is now a multi-million dollar corporation. He learned the business from an early age. Some of his best memories are traveling to other countries with his father to find new products for the store. Bronner's sells more than 50,000 holiday products from 70 nations. Half of the products cost less than ten dollars. Wayne Bronner says the demand for small objects to hang on Christmas trees has expanded over the years. People spend more time, effort and money into decorating their homes with these ornaments, lights and religious scenes. Bronner's is famous for its nativity scenes which show the birth of Jesus Christ. Michigan has the nation's highest unemployment rate. Bronner's has been affected by the recession, too. But not in reduced sales. Wayne Bronner said: \"Even though people are spending less, we're having more people visit here. And as a result we've actually had a sales increase.\" Bronner's success is also linked to community cooperation and investment. Frankenmuth is a town of 5,000 people in eastern Michigan's farm country. The town was settled by Bavarian Germans in the 1800s. It has kept its traditions alive in buildings and restaurants.

It is called Bronner's Christmas Wonderland in Frankenmuth, Michigan. The family-owned business calls itself the world's largest Christmas store. The late Wally Bronner started the business in 1945. Wayne Bronner, Wally's son, is president and CEO of what is now a multi-million dollar corporation. He learned the business from an early age. Some of his best memories are traveling to other countries with his father to find new products for the store. Bronner's sells more than 50,000 holiday products from 70 nations. Half of the products cost less than ten dollars. Wayne Bronner says the demand for small objects to hang on Christmas trees has expanded over the years. People spend more time, effort and money into decorating their homes with these ornaments, lights and religious scenes. Bronner's is famous for its nativity scenes which show the birth of Jesus Christ. Michigan has the nation's highest unemployment rate. Bronner's has been affected by the recession, too. But not in reduced sales. Wayne Bronner said: \"Even though people are spending less, we're having more people visit here. And as a result we've actually had a sales increase.\" Bronner's success is also linked to community cooperation and investment. Frankenmuth is a town of 5,000 people in eastern Michigan's farm country. The town was settled by Bavarian Germans in the 1800s. It has kept its traditions alive in buildings and restaurants.  Bavarian cultural themes and Bronner's huge store bring 3,000,000 visitors a year. The town is the most popular place for tourists in the state. Bronner's business is aimed at a single day of the year. But that is not too different from other businesses.  \"About half of our business is done in the last quarter of the year, in the last three months.

Many mammals also have brown fat, which has the unique ability to produce heat.  Brown fat is sometimes mistaken for a type of gland  , which it resembles more than white fat. It varies in color1 from dark red to tan. When the animal is exposed to a cold environment, the color1 darkens. In contrast to white fat, brown fat has numerous nerves which provide sympathetic stimulation   to the fat cells. Brown fat is most noticeable in newborn animals, wrapped round the central organs to keep them warm. In human infants it occupies up to 5% of body weight, then declines gradually. Certain quantities of brown fat can be discovered in adult humans, especially when they are exposed to cold temperatures. Most of brown fat in adults is located in the lower neck. Exposure to cold leads to sympathetic stimulation of brown fat cell. As in white fat, sympathetic stimulation promotes hydrolysis   of triglyceride  , with release of fatty acids. In contrast to other cells, including white fat cells, brown fat cells express UCP1, which gives the cell's mitochondria   an ability to produce heat rather than ATP. Within brown fat cells, most fatty acids are immediately combined with oxygen in mitochondria and a large amount of heat is produced. There is only about 50g of brown fat in the neck region and it switches on and off throughout the day as it's exposed to different temperatures or if you exercise or eat. But this capacity is much greater in young children compared with adolescents and adults. The challenge is now to use the knowledge to find out what might switch on brown fat. If it is switched on, we can benefit from it. Brown fat produces lots of heat by burning calories. Unlike white fat, brown fat does not expand our ageing waistlines.

As of March 13, 12 different countries, including Malaysia, China, Vietnam and the US, were searching for the plane. The disappearance is an \"aviation   mystery\", Azharuddin Abdul Rahman, the head of Malaysia's Civil Aviation Authority, said on March 10.There was no clear sign of a crash by March 13. Between 1-2 hours after takeoff, the plane suddenly lost contact with people on the ground. The weather was clear, and the pilots didn't make any calls . No evidence was found in the area where the flight last made contact. People are also talking about a possible hijacking  . International police agency Interpol confirmed on March 9 that at least two passengers on the flight had used stolen passports to get on board. \"We are looking at all possibilities,\" said Malaysian Transport Minister Hishamuddin Hussein. The incident is now being called simply a \"plane disappearance\". So, what are some possible causes of a plane disappearance? An AP story provided a summary. 1. A failure of the plane's body or its engines. However, even if both engines stopped working, the plane could still glide   for up to 20 minutes, giving pilots time to make an emergency call. 2. Bad weather. Planes are designed to fly through most severe storms. However, in June 2009, an Air France flight from Rio de Janeiro to Paris crashed during a bad storm over the Atlantic Ocean. 3. A bomb. Throughout history, several planes have been brought down by bombs. 4. An accidental shoot-down by some country's military. In July 1988, the US Navy accidentally shot down an Iran Air flight. In September 1983, a Korean Air Lines flight was shot down by a Russian fighter jet.

As of March 13, 12 different countries, including Malaysia, China, Vietnam and the US, were searching for the plane. The disappearance is an \"aviation   mystery\", Azharuddin Abdul Rahman, the head of Malaysia's Civil Aviation Authority, said on March 10.There was no clear sign of a crash by March 13. Between 1-2 hours after takeoff, the plane suddenly lost contact with people on the ground. The weather was clear, and the pilots didn't make any calls . No evidence was found in the area where the flight last made contact. People are also talking about a possible hijacking  . International police agency Interpol confirmed on March 9 that at least two passengers on the flight had used stolen passports to get on board. \"We are looking at all possibilities,\" said Malaysian Transport Minister Hishamuddin Hussein. The incident is now being called simply a \"plane disappearance\". So, what are some possible causes of a plane disappearance? An AP story provided a summary. 1. A failure of the plane's body or its engines. However, even if both engines stopped working, the plane could still glide   for up to 20 minutes, giving pilots time to make an emergency call. 2. Bad weather. Planes are designed to fly through most severe storms. However, in June 2009, an Air France flight from Rio de Janeiro to Paris crashed during a bad storm over the Atlantic Ocean. 3. A bomb. Throughout history, several planes have been brought down by bombs. 4. An accidental shoot-down by some country's military. In July 1988, the US Navy accidentally shot down an Iran Air flight. In September 1983, a Korean Air Lines flight was shot down by a Russian fighter jet. No matter how unlikely a situation, it's too early to determine what really happened to MH370. It could take months, if not years, to _ any possibilities, say experts..

That doesn't seem like a lot, but just think about the millions of coffees consumed around the world every single day, and you'll see the problem. Sure, some of those coffee grounds are recycled as fertilizer to enrich the soil or beauty products like face masks, but most will be buried into the ground. It was while considering this issue that German product designer Julian Lechner came up with a new way of recycling coffee grounds -- turning them into tableware. \"We were always drinking coffee at university,\" Lechner remembers. \"And that's how I started to wonder. What happens to all that coffee? It was all just getting thrown away.\" He began consulting with his professors about ways of using coffee grounds to create a solid material. \"We tried combining with a lot of different things,\" Lechner said, \"We even tried sugar. That was close, but basically it was a candy cup. It just kept melting after being used three times.\" The whole point was to make it last long, so Lechner and his partners went back to the institute to continue their research. Finally, after many failed experiments, they came up with a mix of coffee grounds and a biopolymer  that seemed to behave the way Lechner had expected it. \"The moment of knowing the cup would actually stand was super-exciting,\" he recalls. \"It was wonderful to drink that first coffee out of the cup. It proved to be totally worth the wait.\" And his creation has proven commercially successful, which is just _ . The coffee cups are now present in ten shops across Europe, and the company can hardly keep up with demand, regularly selling out of its stock online. Lechner will soon launch a larger line of coffee grounds cups and also work on a travel mug. But those are just short-term plans, as Lechner hopes to one day use recycled coffee grounds to create all sort of useful stuff--like sheets and furniture in cafes and restaurants.

How do we cultivate these drives in the classroom?    Ten years ago, we began a research project by asking both teachers and students two simple questions: What kind of work do you find totally engaging? and What kind of work do you hate to do? Almost immediately, we noticed distinct patterns in their responses.     Engaging work, respondents said, was work that stimulated their curiosity, permitted them to express their creativity, and fostered  positive relationships with others. It was also work at which they were good. As for activities they hated, both teachers and students cited work that was repetitive, that required little or no thought, and that was forced on them by others.     How, then, would we define engagement? Perhaps the best definition comes from the work of Phil Schlecty (1994), who says students who are engaged exhibit three characteristics: (1) they are attracted to their work, (2) they persist in their work despite challenges and obstacles, and (3) they take visible delight in accomplishing their work.     Most teachers have seen these signs of engagement during a project, presentation, or lively class discussion.  They have caught glimpses of the inspired inner world of a child, and hoped to sustain  this wonder, enthusiasm, and perseverance every day.

As the potential First Lady, she would have the world's attention. And that means that for the first time people will have a chance to get up close and personal with the type of African woman they so rarely see. Usually, the lives of black women go largely unexamined. The widespread theory seems to be that we're all hot-tempered single mothers who can't keep a man. Even in the world of make-believe, black women still can't escape the stereotype   of being eye-rolling, oversexed females raised by our never-married, alcoholic mothers. These images have helped define the way all black women are viewed, including Michelle Obama. Before she ever gets the chance to commit to a cause, charity or foundation as First Lady, her most urgent and perhaps most complicated duty may be simply to be herself. It won't be easy. Because few mainstream publications   have done in-depth features on regular African-American women, little is known about who we are, what we think and what we face on a regular basis. For better or worse, Michelle will represent us all. Just as she will have her critics, she will have millions of fans who usually have little interest in the First Lady.
