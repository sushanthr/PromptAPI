{"answer": 1, "choices": ["Parents play an important part in children's education.", "Communities have not a bit effect on the way to new and high ideal.", "Educating a child well demands of the work not only from school but from other  organizations.", "Businesses may arrange some training courses for students."], "question": "\"It takes an entire village to raise a child.\" That's an old proverb   that is being quoted more and more often these days. And I'm pleased about that. Today, more and more schools are reaching out to involve parents, community members and businesses to help shape a child's future. Parents need to be involved in their children's education in many ways. Helping children with homework and studying, going on a field trip, teaching a craft or coaching a child's sports team are all great ways to be involved with your child's education. And don't forget to communicate with teachers ---- they need and respect your input. Studies show that children learn more and schools function better when parents and schools work together. It's important to stay in touch with your child's education all through his or her school career. Communities can help children create and achieve new goals. Help with homework, read to a child, coach a children's team, or provide emotional support. Help solve problems and build self-esteem . Kids need role models and advisers can be role models by sharing their experiences and wisdom. Businesses can also help shape our children's future. Invite a class from your local school to visit your workplace. You may be providing a glimpse that opens a new world of possibilities. Show students what goes on during a typical day. Give a mini course for students: how to use a computer; how products are made; how machinery works. You may have a developing electrician, teacher, nurse, or even a newspaper reporter on your hands. It really does take an entire village to raise a child.So share the responsibility -- and the joy -- of bringing a child to his or her full potential .

The company had expected growth of two to four percent in November, fueled by sales on \"Black Friday.\"  The day after Thanksgiving is called that. Storekeepers used to record profits   in black ink and losses in red ink. A day in the black means a return to profit.  The National Retail Federation estimated   in September that holiday sales would increase four and one-half percent this year. Holiday sales increased five percent last year, after poor sales the year before.  The business group estimated that Americans will spend 220,000 million dollars this season. It says they spent just over 10 percent of that last weekend.  Also, it says more Americans for the first time this season plan to use a debit card than a credit card for purchases. A debit card, also called a check card, is linked to the money that a person has in a bank. In other words, users must have the money before they can spend it.

{"answer": 3, "choices": ["1987", "1998", "2004", "2006"], "question": "How did a ban on smoking in public places come into place? In 1998 the Smoking Kills White Paper set out a national strategy   to reduce smoking prevalence   and passive smoking, including in public places. The measures were voluntary and poorly carried out. After a public conference in England in 2004, the Government decided to choose for lawmaking. Scotland went first, with a ban in 2006, followed by the other nations a year later. What is the current law? Any person who smokes in enclosed   public places, including pubs, offices, on public transport and work vehicles, is breaking the law. It does not extend to private houses. It is also an offence for people in charge of premises   to permit others to smoke in them. How was it received? It was welcomed by most organizations except for some pub owners and restaurateurs. Many workplaces in the UK had already introduced smoke-free policies consistent with the legislation (,) before it was carried out, while others have gone beyond its basic requirements. All railway facilities, including platforms, footbridges and other areas--whether or not fitting the definition of an enclosed public space--are covered, as are all football grounds and some cricket and athletics stadiums. School grounds are not required to be smoke-free under the legislation, but the majority now are. How has it been forced? Compliance   in public premises has been high, with inspections suggesting that 99 per cent of places were sticking to the rules. The number of people charged for smoking in cars has been very low, which was due to the problems defining and identifying \"work\" vehicles.

City officials in San Francisco introduced the app to try to reduce traffic jams in the city, but some say it raises safety concerns. In this city, drivers searching for parking spots lead to 30 percent of all downtown jams, city officials think. Now San Francisco has found a solution--a phone app for spot-seekers that displays information about areas with available spaces. The system, introduced last month, relies on wireless sensors   fixed in streets and city garages that can tell within seconds if a spot has opened up. Monique Soltani, a TV reporter, said she and her sister spent 25 minutes on Friday trying to park. \"We were praying to the parking god that we'd find a spot,\" she said. \"If we had the app, we would not have to pray to the parking god.\" But the system could come with serious consequences. Some people say that drivers searching for parking could end up focusing on their phones, not the road. \"It could be really distracting  ,\" said Daniel Simons, a professor of psychology at the University of Illinois. City officials acknowledge the potential problem. They are urging drivers to pull over before they use the city's iPhone app, or to do so before they leave home. Nathaniel Ford, executive director of the San Francisco Municipal Transportation Agency, said safety could actually improve if drivers quickly found a spot instead of circling and getting frustrated. San Francisco has put sensors into 7,000 parking spots and 12,250 spots in city garages. If spaces in an area open up, the sensors communicate wirelessly with computers that in turn make the information available to app users within a minute, said Mr. Ford, of the transportation agency. On the app, a map shows which blocks have lots of places (blue) and which are full (red). More than 12,000 people have downloaded San Francisco's app, which is available now only for the iPhone but which city officials say they hope to bring to all similar devices. When it is started up, the city's parking app warns drivers not to use the system while in motion. But safety advocates said that might not be sufficient. After all, they say, texting while driving is illegal in California and in many states, but a number of surveys, including one by the Pew Research Center, show that many Americans do it anyway. Elizabeth Stampe, executive director of Walk San Francisco, a pedestrian advocacy group, said she hoped the new parking app would lead to fewer accidents. \"It's an innovative idea,\" she said. \"The safe way for people to use the device is for them to pull over, which they know they should do.

{"answer": 2, "choices": ["your boss's criticism", "your leader's inspection", "something unpleasant to be experienced", "sour pop music"], "question": "When someone says, \"Well, I guess I'll have to go to face the music\", it does not mean he is planning to go to a concert. It is something far less pleasant, like being called in by your boss to explain why you did this or that, and why you did not do this or that. Sour(; )music, indeed, but it has to be faced. The phrase \"to face the music\" is familiar to every American, young and old. It is at least 100 years old. Where did the expression come from? The first information comes from the American writer James Fennimore Cooper. He said in 1851 that the expression was first used by actors while waiting in the wings to go on stage. After they got their cue(,) to go on, they often said, \"It's time to go to face the music.\" And that is exactly what they did--- face the orchestra   which was just below the stage. An actor might be frightened or nervous as he moved on to the stage in front of the audience that might be friendly or perhaps unfriendly especially if he forgot his lines. But he had to go out.

My editorial team leader died recently after a short illness. He was 31. The news was so unexpected that it left us all shocked and upset. A female colleague burst into tears and cried piteously at her desk. Somehow we got through the day's work. The next day was the funeral. Our big boss stepped forward to deliver a eulogy  and was soon in tears. She carried on, in Chinese of course, but at the end said in English: \"There will be no more deadlines for you in heaven.\" Next came a long-term colleague who also dissolved in tears but carried on with her speech despite being almost overcome by emotion. Then a close friend of the dead man paid tribute, weeping openly as he spoke. Sorrow is spreading. Me and women were now sobbing uncontrollably. Finally, the man's mother, supported between two women, addressed her son in his coffin. She almost collapsed and had to be held up. We were invited to step forward to each lay a white rose on the casket. Our dead colleague looked as if he was taking a nap. At the end of the service I walked away from the funeral parlor stunned at the outpouring of emotion. In the UK, families grieve privately and then try to hold it together and not break down at a funeral. Here in China it would seem that grieving is a public affair. It strikes me that it is more cathartic to cry your eyes out than try to keep it bottled up for fear of embarrassment, which is what many of us do in the West. Afterwards, a Chinese colleague told me that the lamenting at the funeral had been restrained  by Chinese standards. In some rural areas, she said, people used to be paid to mourn noisily.

It was the sixth year in a row this bird has hatched a chick. Wisdom's species normally lives only 12 to 40 years, while she is able to hatch healthy chicks into her 60s. At breeding time, the Laysan albatross will dig out a shallow nest in the ground. The female then lays a single egg. Both she and her mate will take turns incubating   the egg until it hatches. More than seven out of every 10 Laysan albatrosses' nests are on just one island -Midway Atoll. That's Wisdom's home. But her species spends most of its time in the air. In fact, biologists observe that after learning to fly, these birds may not set foot on land for the next three to five years.

Scientific research in physics and biology has vastly broadened our views.

The continuation of such activities in the twenty-first century will result in even greater advantages to human beings : in pure science--a wider and deeper knowledge in all fields of learning ;in applied science--a more reasonable sharing of material benefits ,and better protection of the environment.        Sadly ,however ,there is another side to the picture .The creativity of science has been employed in doing damage to mankind .The application of science and technology to the development and production of weapons of mass destruction has created a real danger to the continued existence of the human race on this planet .We have seen this happen in the case of nuclear weapons ,Although their actual use has so far occurred only in the Second World War ,the number of nuclear weapons that were produced and made ready for use was so large that if the weapons had actually been used ,the result could have been the ruin of the human race ,as well as of many kinds of animals.

{"answer": 2, "choices": ["The year when the game is held.", "English letters.", "Roman numerals", "Arabic numerals"], "question": "The Super Bowl is the annual championship game of the National Football League (NFL), the highest level of professional American football in the United States, becoming a season that begins in the late summer of the previous calendar year. The Super Bowl uses Roman numerals to identify each game, rather than the year in which it is held, with Super Bowl I being the 1966 season championship game, when the Green Bay Packers beat the Kansas City Chiefs. Super Bowl XLVI (46) was played at Lucas Oil Stadium in Indianapolis, on February 5, 2012, to determine the champion of the 2011 season; the New York Giants beat the New England Patriots. The game was created as part of a _ agreement between the NFL and its rival league, the American Football League (AFL). It was agreed that the two leagues' champion teams would play in an AFL--NFL World Championship Game until the merger was to officially begin in 1970. After the merger, each league was appointed as a \"conference\", and the game was then played between the conference champions. Currently, the National Football Conference (NFC) leads the series with 25 wins to 21 wins for the American Football Conference (AFC). The day on which the Super Bowl is played, now considered to be an existing American national holiday, is called \"Super Bowl Sunday\", though it is not determined by the government. It is the second--largest day for U.S. food consumption, after Thanksgiving Day. In addition, the Super Bowl has frequently been the most watched American television broadcast of the year. Because of its high viewership, commercial airtime during the Super Bowl broadcast is the most expensive of the year. Due to the high cost of investing in advertising on the Super Bowl, companies regularly develop their most expensive advertisements for this broadcast. As a result, watching and discussing the broadcast's commercials has become a significant aspect of the event. In addition, many popular singers and musicians have performed during the event's pre-game and halftime ceremonies because of the exposure's attracting more fans.

They grow, they bulge , they stretch they stretch and sometimes they even painfully pull. But for all the work they do for us, we are still unable to crown one as \"the strongest muscle.\" Instead, a few muscles could claim the title, depending on how strength is measured. If the title goes to the muscle that can exert  the most force, the victor would be the soleus , according to Gray's Anatomy . Without this muscle, we wouldn't be able to stand, walk, run or shake our bodies on the dance floor. If the soleus was not continuously pulling, we would always be falling over ourselves (although some of us tend to do that from time to time anyway). But perhaps the title should go to the muscle that exerts the most pressure. Pressure is different from force -- pressure takes into account the area over which a force is exerted. The muscle that takes the prize for delivering the greatest amount of pressure is the masseter, or the jaw muscle, according to the book \"Clinical Oral Science\" (Reed Educational and Professional Publishing, 1998). In 1986, Richard Hofmann of Lake City, Fla., achieved a bite strength of 975 pounds (442 kilograms) for two seconds, setting a Guinness Record. Talk about jaw dropping! The jaw is able to clench  and chew because of the masseter muscle. Others may argue the muscles used in childbirth are the most powerful. When it comes to versatility, perhaps the tongue is the strongest muscle. Its combination of elasticity  and forcefulness gives us the ability to speak, eat and kiss - all things very desirable on a first date. However dexterous  it may be though, its power does not match that of muscles such as the soleus. If slow and steady wins the race, the heart is certainly a _ for the title.

In dry or desert areas, birds will not always be able to find water in which to bath, but they still need to clean their feathers. What many birds will do is to take dust baths. They will roll around in dust until it covers their feathers. They will stand up, shaking the dust out, and then clean their feathers with their beaks   as usual.

The results show that simply hearing their mothers' voice over the phone works just as well at calming the nerves of stressed children as a real-life pat on the shoulder.

This \"love hormone\" is known to _ stress and is likely to be involved in social connections, including those between a mother and a child. Previous work has revealed that this hormone is released during physical contact with a mother. \"But it's clear from these results that a mother's voice can have the same effect as a hug, even if she isn't actually standing there,\" said the researcher, Leslie Seltzer, a biological scientist. Seltzer tested a group of 61 girls, aged 7 to 12, by having them make an unprepared speech and solve a series of maths problems in front of a group of strangers, sending their hearts racing and levels of cortisol--a hormone associated with stress--soaring. Facing a challenge like that raises stress levels of a lot of people. Once stressed, a third of the girls were comforted in person by their mothers with hugs. A third of the girls watched an emotionally neutral 75-minute video. The rest were handed a telephone with their mothers on the line. For the girls who interacted in person or over the phone with their mothers, the levels of the \"love hormone\" rose significantly, and the stress-marking hormone was washed away. This effect didn't show up for participants who watched the video. Seltzer is now testing the amount of oxytocin released with other communication methods--like text messaging--and hopes to see the research spread out from human subjects. \"It's not just us, of course.

But a new study by government scientists in the United States has some people wondering what to think. The scientists have found that holding a cellphone to your ear for more than fifty minutes increases brain cell activity. Even the scientists themselves are not sure about the meaning of their findings. Dr Nora Volkow led the study. She heads the National Institute on Drug Abuse, part of the National Institutes of Health. Dr Volkow says she is not concerned that fifty minutes of cellphone exposure   would harm anyone. But she says the research does show the need to study whether there are long-lasting effects of repeated exposure over several years. Her team studied forty-seven healthy volunteers between January and December of 2009. The volunteers had cellphones placed against both ears while the scientists made images of their brain activity. As part of the test, one phone was activated  for fifty minutes. The other phone was off. After that, the volunteers were tested with both phones turned off. Dr Volkow says the brain scans  showed increased activity in brain cells closest to the activated phone. The scans showed how the brain cells used sugar to produce energy, a normal activity.

The scene I just described came in different forms during my two years' teaching at the school. Papers were often copied from the Web and the Harvard Business Review. Case study debates were written up and just memorized. Students frequently said that copying is a superior business strategy, better than inventing and creating. In China, every product you can imagine has been made and sold. But so few well developed marketing and management minds have been raised that it will be a long time before most people in the world can name a Chinese brand. With this problem in mind, partnerships with institutions like Yale and MIT have been established. And then there's the \"thousand talent scheme\": this new government program is intended to improve technological modernization by attracting top foreign trained scientists to the mainland with big money. But there are worries about China's research environment. It's hardly known for producing independent thinking and openness, and even big salary offers may not be attractive enough to overcome this. At last, for China, becoming a major world creator is not just about setting up partnerships with top Western universities. Nor is it about gathering a group of well-educated people and telling them to think creatively. It's about establishing a rich learning environment for young minds. It's not that simple.

Davos is ideal for an active holiday in a magnificent mountain setting. Whether in summer or winter, you can almost enjoy every type of sport. Skiing, snowboarding, cross-country skiing and ice-sports in winter. Hiking, running, mountain biking, golfing and water sports in summer. Tennis, squash, horse-riding, hand-gliding and paragliding are year-round attractions, Spengler Cup Ice Hockey Tournament and the UBS Snowboard World Championships are just a few of the highlights from an impressive palette of sporting attractions.  During the last 35 years, Davos has firmly established itself as a successful and competitive international congress venue  , despite its slightly distant location. World Economic Forum for example, is held here annually. The town's strong point lies in its contrast to the conventional congress resort, offering an inviting combination of education and relaxation far from the hustle and bustle of city life.  Davos boasts a long skiing tradition. At the turn of the 19thcentury it was mainly the British, who together with a few local people influenced the beginning of Alpine ski sport. The world's first ski lift was opened at Bolgen in 1934. Parts of this lift are now exhibited in the Davos Winter Sports Museum. But Davos was not just one of the pioneers of Alpine skiing. It was also one of the first resorts to recognize and support snowboarding as a sign of the times rather than just an insignificant passing trend.

The Little Tramp, a well meaning man in a raggedy suit with cane, always found himself wobbling into awkward situations and strangely wobbling away. More than any other figure, it is this kind-hearted character that we associate with the time before the talkies (sound films). Born in London in 1889, Chaplin first visited America with a theater company in 1907. Appearing as \"Billy\" in the play \"Sherlock Holmes\", the young Chaplin toured the country twice. On his second tour, he met Mack Sennett and was signed to Keystone Studios to act in films. In 1914 Chaplin made his first one-reeler, \"Making a Living\". That same year he made thirty-four more short films, including \"Caught in a Cabaret\", \"Caught in the Rain\", \"The Face on the Bar-Room Floor\", and \"His Trysting Place\". These early silent shorts allowed very little time for anything but physical comedy, and Chaplin was a master at it.

Actually while early formal education of poor children does show great gains in the early elementary years, studies also show that this head start is really a \"false start\", as the gains are lost in middle and high school years.It seems that environment is a bigger factor on life's success than early education.Head Start programs have not achieved its original goal in closing the achievement gap in poor and middle school children.Perhaps it is time to find other ways to close that gap.

EarthKAM is an educational activity and outreach investigation that also results in remote Earth sensing and observation. Using the Internet, the students control a special digital camera fixed aboard the space station, enabling them to photograph the Earth's coastlines, mountain ranges and other geographic items of interest from the unique advantage point of space. While EarthKAM offers a powerful way for students to investigate Earth from the unique perspective of space, it is also inspiring the next generation of flight controllers for space programs--involving university students to control and operate the camera system and related activities from the ground. In the interview, Brion Au, one of the investigation developers at NASA's Johnson Space Centre, said,\"EarthKAM is a payload by students, for students. They are in charge. This system provides a viewpoint that the astronauts have...it's just aweinspiring!\"So far, students have captured more than 40,000 photos of the Earth from the space station as it orbited the Earth once every 90 minutes, traveling at 17,500 miles an hour.

This kind of loneliness is not serious. In fact, it is quite normal. For some people, though, loneliness can last for years. Now researchers say there are three different types of loneliness. The first kind of loneliness is temporary. This is the most common type. It usually disappears quickly and does not require any special attention. The second kind, situational loneliness, is a natural result of a particular situation -- for example, family problem, the death of a loved one, or moving to a new place. Although this kind of loneliness can cause physical problems, such as headaches and sleeplessness, it usually does not last for more than a year. The third kind of loneliness is the most severe. Unlike the second type, habitual loneliness usually lasts more than two years and has no specific cause. People who experience habitual loneliness have problems socializing and becoming close to others. Unfortunately, many chronically lonely people think there is little or nothing they can do to improve their condition. Psychologists agree that one important factor in loneliness is a person's social contacts, e.g. friends, family members, co-workers, etc. We depend on various people for different reasons. For instance, our families give us emotional support, our parents and teachers give us guidance, and our friends share similar interests and activities. However, psychologists have found that, though lonely people may have many social contacts, they sometimes feel they should have more. They question their popularity. Psychologists are trying to find ways to help habitually lonely people for two reasons: they are unhappy and unable to socialize and there is a connection between habitual loneliness and serious illness such as heart disease. While temporary and situational loneliness can be a normal, healthy part of life, habitual loneliness can be a sad and sometimes dangerous condition.

People who experience habitual loneliness have problems socializing and becoming close to others. Unfortunately, many chronically lonely people think there is little or nothing they can do to improve their condition. Psychologists agree that one important factor in loneliness is a person's social contacts, e.g. friends, family members, co-workers, etc. We depend on various people for different reasons. For instance, our families give us emotional support, our parents and teachers give us guidance, and our friends share similar interests and activities. However, psychologists have found that, though lonely people may have many social contacts, they sometimes feel they should have more. They question their popularity. Psychologists are trying to find ways to help habitually lonely people for two reasons: they are unhappy and unable to socialize and there is a connection between habitual loneliness and serious illness such as heart disease. While temporary and situational loneliness can be a normal, healthy part of life, habitual loneliness can be a sad and sometimes dangerous condition.

He is a hard worker, who also loves to run and play. In short, he's an ideal friend and a heroic character. Here is the thing: Joey is a horse, who appears as the main character in Steven Spielberg's new film War Horse. It is based on Michael Morpurgo's 1982 novel, which also caused the same-titled Tony Awards winning play. The film follows the saga of Joey, a racehorse that's trained for farm work under the loving care of Albert (Jeremy Irvine )after Albert's drunk father Ted(Peter Mullan ) overpays for the animal at auction . Then the World War I tears Albert and Joey apart. Joey is sold into the war effort for the British and starts his episodic adventures in Europe.

A new study from Carnegie Mellon University shows anger may help people reduce the negative impacts of stress and help you become healthier. \"Here getting emotional is not bad for you if you look at the case of anger,\" said Jennifer Lerner of Carnegie Mellon. \"The more people display anger, the lower their stress responses.\" Lerner studied 92 UCLA students by asking them to count back from 6,200. They must say out loud every thirteenth number. Researchers disturbed them by asking them to count faster or ask them other questions. If they made any mistakes, they had  to restart from the very beginning. Many students felt depressed about making so many mistakes or got angry because the researchers were interrupting them. Lerner used a hidden video camera and recorded all their facial expressions during the test. The researchers describe their reactions as fear, anger and disgust. Other researchers recorded the students' blood pressure, pulse and production of a high-stress hormone   called cortisol. People whose faces showed more fear during th e experiment had higher blood pressure and higher levels of the hormone. Both can have lasting effects such as diabetes  , heart disease, depression and extra weight gain. When people feel fear, negative impacts increase, but when they get angry, those negatives go down, according to the study. \"Having that sense of anger leads people to actually feel some power in what otherwise is maddening   situation,\" Lerner said. Lerner previously studied Americans' emotional response to the 911 terrorist attacks two months after the incident. She found people who reacted with anger were more optimistic. These people are healthier compared with those who were frightened during the event. So in maddening situations, anger is not a bad thing to have. It's a healthier response than fear.

A new study from Carnegie Mellon University shows anger may help people reduce the negative impacts of stress and help you become healthier. \"Here getting emotional is not bad for you if you look at the case of anger,\" said Jennifer Lerner of Carnegie Mellon. \"The more people display anger, the lower their stress responses.\" Lerner studied 92 UCLA students by asking them to count back from 6,200. They must say out loud every thirteenth number. Researchers disturbed them by asking them to count faster or ask them other questions. If they made any mistakes, they had  to restart from the very beginning. Many students felt depressed about making so many mistakes or got angry because the researchers were interrupting them. Lerner used a hidden video camera and recorded all their facial expressions during the test. The researchers describe their reactions as fear, anger and disgust. Other researchers recorded the students' blood pressure, pulse and production of a high-stress hormone   called cortisol. People whose faces showed more fear during th e experiment had higher blood pressure and higher levels of the hormone. Both can have lasting effects such as diabetes  , heart disease, depression and extra weight gain. When people feel fear, negative impacts increase, but when they get angry, those negatives go down, according to the study. \"Having that sense of anger leads people to actually feel some power in what otherwise is maddening   situation,\" Lerner said. Lerner previously studied Americans' emotional response to the 911 terrorist attacks two months after the incident. She found people who reacted with anger were more optimistic.

The building--the country's largest commercial and shopping complex--uses less than 10% of the energy of a conventional building of its size. The Eastgate's owners saved $3.5 million on a $36 million building because an air-conditioning equipment didn't have to be imported.

During summer's cool nights, big fans blow air through the building seven times an hour to cool the empty floors. By day, smaller fans blow two changes of air an hour through the building, to circulate the air which has been in contact with the cool floors. For winter days, there are small heaters in the vents.

{"answer": 1, "choices": ["In a forest", "In a mountain", "Along a river", "Near an airport"], "question": "After we finished thirteen miles of hiking, we were tired and our muscles ached as we made our way back to New England. The car ride to the airport followed by a two-hour flight left our legs more worse condition than they were when we first came off the mountain we just climbed. When we heard that two seats in first class on our next flight were available for a bit higher price, we jumped at the opportunity. Our spirits lifted immediately. After all, flying first class was a new experience for us, and we would end our adventure in comfort and style. As we boarded the plane, we noticed that the stewardess  was working non-stop to ensure the comfort of the first class passengers. She could not walk by a seat without receiving an order. How much she must love her job! She smiled kindly at each one while attending to their needs.

{"answer": 2, "choices": ["make a comparison", "describe a person", "introduce a topic", "tell a story"], "question": "Last year, Jack Bleed cut through the bone of his ring finger while working. The 31-year-old resident of North Little Rock, Arkansas, waited for about six hours at a nearby medical center while the medical staff there called all over town -- even as far away as Dallas and Memphis -- to find a hand surgeon to reattach his finger. Finally, a willing doctor was located in Louisville, Kentucky. But even though Bleed had insurance , he would have to hire a private plane to get himself there, at a cost of $4,300. In the end, he charged the cost to two credit cards, and his finger was saved. His insurance company eventually covered the cost of the plane, but his experience makes people aware of the fact that trauma  care in the United States is not only geographically limited, but in many places, non-existent. Only eight states -- New York, New Jersey, Maryland, Illinois, New Mexico, California, Oregon, and Washington -- have local, fully functional trauma systems. The remaining states have partial systems, and 12 -- including Arkansas -- have no trauma system at all. Although the President has signed a bill of $12 million for the purpose of supporting trauma care systems nationwide, many in Congress  are unwilling to spend government money for a service they think should be paid for by states, says Wayne Meredith, medical director for trauma programs at the American College of Surgeons. Meanwhile, many states have also failed to find the dollars to support trauma systems. To make matters worse, many people without insurance depend heavily on the emergency care services, placing a huge financial burden on the medical centers that serve them. For the same reason, doctors, too, often go unpaid. They are unwilling to perform emergency care, worsening critical shortages of neurosurgeons, orthopedists, and hand surgeons -- the very types of specialists Bleed needed at short notice. Supporting a trauma care system doesn't take much. A half-penny sales tax in Miami-Dade County makes its outstanding system work. In Arkansas alone, says Wayne Meredith, a well-funded trauma system would possibly prevent 200 to 600 deaths each year.

{"answer": 1, "choices": ["understand", "recognize", "like", "surprise"], "question": "People often hear each others' voices without ever seeing the faces they belong to. \"Nowadays we are talking away on the phone without meeting people,\" says Seung-Jae Moon. And from business conference calls to chat lines, people often imagine they would recognize the speaker if they saw him or her. Seung-Jae Moon, a linguist of Korea found that, under certain conditions, they're actually right. Moon decided to see just how close those mental pictures match up with reality and if there was any relation to how people speak rather than what they are saying. He recorded 16 Koreans, half men and half women, reading the same passage, and took a full-body photo and head shot of each speaker. Then he played the tapes for 361 Koreans and 173 Americans who did not speak Korean and asked his subjects to match up voice and picture. The Korean participants viewing full-body photos were quite perceptive. A majority linked 6 of the 8 women to the correct voice and did so for 5 of the 8 men. With the Korean group shown only faces, accuracy plummeted, but more than 20 percent of the subjects selected the same incorrect picture. The Americans showed no accuracy in matching the foreign voices to photos, but they too were consistent in their errors. That disconnection reveals conflicting ideas of physical and vocal beauty.

This definition includes everyone who is employed or seeking paid employment, so it includes employers and the self-employed. Labor is one of the country's resources which can be combined with other resources to produce the goods and services wanted by the community.               Although the size of the workforce depends a great deal on the size of the total population, there are several other influences which also affect it. The age distribution   of the total population has a very marked effect on the available workforce. If the population has a high proportion of very young people or of those too old to work, then the available workforce would be lower than if there were a balanced spread age distribution. If the population naturally grows rapidly, the number of births greatly exceeds   the number of deaths then as a total population increases proportion of the workforce declines.               Sometimes a population is described as aging which means that the birth rate is either falling or growing very slowly, and as people retire from the workforce there are insufficient numbers of young people entering it to replace those who are leaving it. In that situation the population is top-heavy with older people. So the percentage of the population in the workforce declines when there is either a rapid increase in births or a falling birth rate.

Stress was originally just a shortterm biological response to danger;however,the constant stress of modern education rarely stops. It's long term,at least ten years and usually more. Recent research has shown that the neurological response to stress is the same response that is found in depression. So,what's the solution? A number have been proposed,including but not limited to the following.  _ .Exercise consumes energy that would otherwise build up in the stress response and could cause physical and mental problems. Teach relaxation exercises. Allowing the mind and body to relax cuts off the stress response and reduces the neurological fatigue ,enabling the individual to recover at least somewhat.

{"answer": 3, "choices": ["made great contributions to keeping human body from getting spoiled from chronic diseases.", "has developed the Reverse My Disease program with Dr. Patel.", "recommended Ken Drew to Dr. Patel.", "might be a great scientist who did research on bacteria."], "question": "Quickly ask yourself: What did you eat today? Now tell me how you actually feel. If you're complaining of stress, anxiety, depression, aches and pains, foggy thinking, or just a general lack of energy, a new medical theory will blow your mind. The chances are that those disease-like symptoms are all the result of what's called hidden food allergies . This is what Ken Drew found out when he was lucky enough to be recommended to medical practitioner Dr. Patel. Patel is considered something of a genius, and has been called a modern day Louis Pasteur. You've heard of him, of course--Pasteur figured out how to keep milk from getting spoiled. Dr. Patel is like a Louis Pasteur for keeping your body from getting spoiled from chronic  diseases. \"Foggy thinking, slightly constipated , heart pain,...you name it. It's part of getting old,\" you say. \"It's just stress.\" Most of the body's immune defenses are all located in your stomach, so when you have a hidden food allergy and you expose yourself to harmful foods, your defenses malfunction  and disease-carrying bacteria take over.

{"answer": 0, "choices": ["Goal conflict.", "High pressure.", "Too much expectation.", "Lack of exercise."], "question": "Want to add some hours to your day? Ok, you probably can't change the fabric of time. But a new study suggests that the way you feel about your goal can change your concept of time and that some simple strategies could make you feel less rushed. In a series of experiments, Jordan Etkin, a professor of marketing at Duke, and her co-authors, Loannis Evangelidis and Jennifer Aaker, looked at what happens when people see their goals as conflicting with one another. In one, they asked some participants to list two of their goals that they felt were in conflict, and others simply to list two of their goals. Those who were forced to think about conflicting aims felt more time pressure than those who weren't. In another experiment, the researchers gave participants a similar prompt regarding goal conflict, but this time measured their anxiety levels as well as their attitudes toward time. They found that participants who thought about conflicting goals had more anxiety than those who didn't, and that this, in turn, led to feelings of being short on time. \"Stress and anxiety and time pressure are closely linked concepts,\" D. Etkin explained. \"When we feel more stress and anxiety in relation to our personal goals, that manifests as a sense of having less time.\" Technological advances that allow people to do lots of things at once may increase the fe'eling of goal conflict, she said.\"I think the easier it is for us to try to deal with a lot of these things at the same time,\" She  said\"the more opportunity there is for us to feel this conflict between our goals.\"She isn't the first to suggest that actual busyness isn't the only thing that can make us feel busy  At the Atlantic, Derek Thompson wrote that \"as a country, we're working less than we did in the 1960s and 1980s.\" He offered a number of possible reasons some Americans still feel so overworked, including \"the fluidness ffl+-) of work and leisure.\" As he put it:\"The idea that work begins and ends at the office is wrong. On the one hand, flexibility is nice, On the other, mixing work and leisure together creates an always-on expectation that makes it hard for white-collar workers to escape the shadow of work responsibilities.\" And Brigid Schulte writes in her 2014 book Overwhelmed: How to Work, Love, and Play When No One Has the Time that some researchers believe \"time has no sharp edges. What often matters more than the activity we're doing at a moment in time, they have found, is how we feel about it.Our concept of time is indeed,our reality.\" Fortunately, Dr. Etkin and her team did find ways of making us feel better about time--or, at least, of reducing the negative influence of goal conflict. When participants performed a breathing exercise that reduced their anxiety, the impact of such conflict on their perception of time was less pronounced. Reframing anxiety as excitement (by reading the phrase \"I am excited!\" aloud several times) had a similar effect. Breathing and reframing may not solve everyone's time problems--Ms. Schulte writes that some Americans are indeed working more than they used to.

About 88,000 international students have found solution. They are attending U.S. community colleges. Such colleges are sometimes called junior colleges. They offer two years of education above the secondary or high school level. Community college students can choose from subjects like medical assistance, computer science or law. At the end of their study program, they receive a document of completion, called a certificate. Some students work toward an associate degree in traditional academic subjects like science or history. After getting it, the students can move on to a four-year college or university. They may have only two years of study left before they receive a bachelor's degree. Many educational experts agree that saving money is the major reason to consider a community college.

According to scientists, the thought isn't as unbelievable as it seems. A study found going without sleep for just one night causes changes in the brain similar to those that occur after a blow to the head. The researchers said the healthy young men examined in the study showed a sudden increase in the same chemicals which indicate brain damage. Professor Christian Benedict, of Uppsala University, Sweden, explained that the chemicals NSE and S-100B are biomarkers for brain damage, such as concussion . He said, \"What we found was their levels in the blood rose in the group that went without sleep for a night. This was not to the extent that would happen after a head injury, for instance, but it was still significant. During sleep, the brain cleans poisonous substances off itself.\" Benedict also said previous studies which linked a lack of sleep with increased risk of Alzheimer's, Parkinson's and multiple sclerosis could applaud his study. The rise of the chemicals in the blood after sleep loss may suggest not getting enough sleep contributes to a loss of brain tissue, he explained.

It might sound like science fiction,but professors at the university of Tokyo have taken the first steps toward making that scenario a reality.The team recently introduced a humanoid kitchen robot that can pour tea and other drinks into cups and serve them to guests.When teatime is over,the robot can also wash the dishes and put them away.

Readybot was created by engineers and designers who established a club called the Readybot Challenge.They believe that in the future millions of robots will be needed in homes to perform ordinary household tasks.Readybot is just the first step in their plan to create a robot that can tackle jobs not only in kitchens but in other rooms of homes and in offices as well.

The flag reinforces the idea of the Olympic Movement's universality , as it brings together all the countries of the world.  Pierre de Coubertin, the father of the modern Olympic Games, explains the meaning of the flag: \"The Olympic flag has a white background, with five interlaced  rings in the centre: blue, yellow, black, green and red. This design is symbolic; it represents the five continents of the world, united by Olympism, while the six color1s are those that appear on all the national flags of the world at the present time.\" (1931)  Combined in this way, the six color1s of the flag (including the white of the background) represent all nations. It is wrong, therefore, to believe that each of the color1s corresponds to a  certain continent! At the Olympic Games, the flag is brought into the stadium during the opening ceremony. Since the 1960 Games in Rome (prefix = st1 /Italy), it has been carried horizontally by a delegation of athletes or other people well known for their positive work in society.

One year later, in 1913, the five rings appeared at the top of a letter written by Pierre de Coubertin. He drew the rings and color1ed them in by hand.

Sheppard's look of pain increased. \"You are ten and Rufus Johnson is fourteen,\" he said. \"Yet, I'm sure your shirts would fit Rufus.\" Rufus Johnson was a boy whom he had been trying to help at the reformatory  for the past year. He had been released two months ago. \"When he was in the reformatory, he looked pretty good, but when I saw him yesterday, he was skin and bones. He hasn't been eating cake with peanut butter on it for breakfast.\" The child paused. \"It's not fresh,\" he said. \"That's why I have to put stuff on it.\" Sheppard turned his face to the window at the end of the bar. The side lawn, green and even, sloped fifty feet or so down to a small suburban wood. When his wife was living, they had often eaten outside, even breakfast on the grass. He had never noticed then that the child was selfish. ks5u \"Listen to me,\" he said, turning back to him, \"look at me and listen.\" The boy looked at him. At least his eyes were forward. \"I gave Rufus a key to the house when he left the reformatory---to show my confidence in him and so he would have a place he could come to and feel welcome any time. He didn't use it, but I think he'll use it now because he's seen me and he's hungry. And if he doesn't use it, I'm going out and find him and bring him here. I can't see a child eating out of garbage cans.\" The boy frowned. It was dawning upon him that something of his was threatened. Sheppard's mouth stretched in disgust. \"Rufus's father died before he was born,\" he said. \"His mother is in the state penitentiary  . He was raised by his grandfather in a shack  without water or electricity and the old man beat him every day. How would you like to belong to a family like that?\" \"I don't know\" the child said lamely. \"Well, you might think about it sometime,\" Sheppard said. Sheppard was City Recreational Director. On Saturday he worked at the reformatory as a counselor, receiving nothing for it but the satisfaction of knowing he was helping boys no one else cared about. Johnson was the most intelligent boy he had worked with. Norton turned what was left of the cake over as if he no longer wanted it. \"You started that, now finish it,\" Sheppard said. \"Maybe he won't come,\" the child said and his eyes brightened slightly.

They cause traffic accidents, injury and death. These dangerous walkers can be seen in any big city over the world. About 69% of last year's pedestrian deaths in the US occurred in urban areas. They cross streets ignoring \"DON'T WALK\" signals, suddenly appear without warning from behind parked vehicles, walk slowly at crossroads with cell phones attached to heads, blocking traffic. These pedestrians and drivers share a common disregard for the rules of the road, both for selfish reasons. The drivers believe in the power of their machines. If their machines can go faster, they believe they have the right to go faster. If their machines are bigger, they believe they have the right to push smaller vehicles aside. Aggressive pedestrians, on the other hand, believe in the primacy  of the individual, the idea that they are first in any environment, under any circumstances, even when they are on foot in a roaring tide of steel and rubber. Last year, an estimated 5,220 pedestrians died in traffic accidents. Some 69,000 pedestrians were injured. On average, that worked out to one pedestrian killed in a traffic crash every 101 minutes, and one injured every eight minutes. The good news is that the accident rate is dropping. For example, the number of pedestrians killed last year was 24 percent less than the number killed in traffic accidents a decade earlier. The bad news is that the basic causes of pedestrian deaths remain pretty much the same----disregard for traffic signals, inattention and crossing roads under the influence of alcohol and drugs. Alcohol, in fact, was involved in 46 percent of the traffic accidents that resulted in pedestrian deaths. Of those, 31 percent of the pedestrians were found to be drunk. The bottom line is that the pedestrians must do more to protect their lives as well as the lives of other road users.

Maybe  you  could  put  up  a  few  birdhouses  and  plant  some butterfly bushes now and save the trees and bushes for next year. Even a small start is a big step for wildlife. Reach for Resources To make the habitat happen, you'll need lots of plants, seeds, and other supplies. You'll also need to buy or borrow tools and maybe even some heavy equipment. Now's the time to reach out for donations. Start by asking your parent-teacher organization. Then go to garden clubs, garden stores (they might give you a discount), local government agencies, and businesses. If they can't donate supplies or money, ask if they can donate workers! The workers can help build  the habitat. You'll also need people  to help maintain  it. Some schools ask their students' families to take turns during the summer. Each family maintains  the habitat for a couple of weeks. Build Your Design Now you can dig in. Set a date, and get growing! How has the author organized the article?", "subject": ""}

A new study from the University of the New South Wales has discovered that during the working week, Aussie fathers only spend an average of just over a minute each day alone with their children. Australian mothers, on the other hand, spend three hours a week looking after their children -a much greater disparity  than in other countries like America, Denmark, Italy and France, where couples divide the child-care more evenly. These findings will upset those who want to shake off the perhaps unfair image of the Australia as a land of old-fashioned male chauvinism . According to the study, Australian fathers appear to like the fun aspects of parenthood, but shy away from the drudgery. So while they tend to be happy taking the kids to the park or to sports events, they are unlikely to participate regularly in feeding, bathing, or taking the kids to school. In short, parenting is seen as a woman's job and a man's hobby in Australia.

Some might not want to admit it, but there is a hidden Cinderella in everyone's heart--we all wish we could achieve recognition or success after a period of obscurity . Mary Santiago has that secret dream, too. Her story is featured  in Another Cinderella Story, a film set in a US high school. Mary is shy but loves to dance. Compared with other girls, she is invisible. However, her world changes completely when a famous teenager pop singer, Joey Parker, appears. Joey is everything the rest of the boys in her class are not--kind, handsome and desirable. Mary and Joey's paths cross at a ball. They meet and fall in love with each other. But when Mary has to rush back home, she leaves behind her MP3 player, which becomes the only clue Joey has to find the girl of his dreams. Of course, there is a wicked  stepmother, who turns out to be Dominique Blatt and she takes in Mary after her dancer mother dies. Dominique treats Mary like a maid and does everything she can to make sure Mary doesn't get into the top dance school. Her two daughters are equally determined to stop Joey falling for Mary, even if that means embarrassing her. The story, though it mostly follows Cinderella, does add a few modern day twists to the classic fairy tale. Refreshingly, the film, unlike many high school films, does not focus on looks, although the actors are all beautiful. There is also a lot less materialism in Another Cinderella Story than in many similar movies. \"The movie takes the Cinderella fairytale as its jumping off point,\" writes movie critic Amber Wilkinson, \"The focus is firmly on following your dream.\" What can we infer from the passage?", "subject": ""}

Compared with other girls, she is invisible. However, her world changes completely when a famous teenager pop singer, Joey Parker, appears. Joey is everything the rest of the boys in her class are not--kind, handsome and desirable. Mary and Joey's paths cross at a ball. They meet and fall in love with each other. But when Mary has to rush back home, she leaves behind her MP3 player, which becomes the only clue Joey has to find the girl of his dreams. Of course, there is a wicked  stepmother, who turns out to be Dominique Blatt and she takes in Mary after her dancer mother dies. Dominique treats Mary like a maid and does everything she can to make sure Mary doesn't get into the top dance school. Her two daughters are equally determined to stop Joey falling for Mary, even if that means embarrassing her. The story, though it mostly follows Cinderella, does add a few modern day twists to the classic fairy tale. Refreshingly, the film, unlike many high school films, does not focus on looks, although the actors are all beautiful. There is also a lot less materialism in Another Cinderella Story than in many similar movies. \"The movie takes the Cinderella fairytale as its jumping off point,\" writes movie critic Amber Wilkinson, \"The focus is firmly on following your dream.\" The passage is mainly about   _  .", "subject": ""}

{"answer": 0, "choices": ["Because the rich tend to decide a thing.", "Because money can tell us something.", "Because it is hard to earn much money.", "Because everyone loves to have money."], "question": "People often say that money talks. They mean that a person with a lot of money can say how he or she wants things done. But it is not easy to earn enough money to gain this kind of power. Ask anyone in business. They will tell you that it is a jungle out there. The expression probably began because a jungle is filled with wild animals and unknown dangers that threaten people. People in business have to be careful if they are to survive the jungle out there. They must not be led into making bogus investments. Bogus means something that is not real. Nobody is sure how the word got started. But it began to appear in American newspapers in the 1800s. A newspaper in Boston, Massachusetts, said the word came from a criminal whose name was Borghese. Borghese wrote checks to people although he did not have enough money in the bank. After he wrote the checks, he would disappear. So, people who were paid with his checks received nothing. The newspaper said Americans shortened and changed the criminal's name Borghese to Bogus. People trying to earn money must be also aware of the risk of being ripped off. A writer for a magazine said he first saw the expression used in 1971. It was on a sign that a student carried during a protest demonstration at a university. The message on the sign was that the student felt cheated. To be successful, a person in business works hard and tries to get down to brass tacks. This expression means to get to the bottom or the most important part of something. For example, a salesman may talk about his product without saying the price. You get down to brass tacks when you say, \"it sounds good, but how much does it cost?\" Word expert Charles Funk thinks the expression comes from sailors on ships. They clean the bottom of a boat. When they have removed all the dirt, they are down to the copper pieces that hold the ship together. So, if we get down to brass tacks, we can prevent rip-offs and bogus ways of earning money in that jungle out there. And, some good luck will help, too.

They mean that a person with a lot of money can say how he or she wants things done. But it is not easy to earn enough money to gain this kind of power. Ask anyone in business. They will tell you that it is a jungle out there. The expression probably began because a jungle is filled with wild animals and unknown dangers that threaten people. People in business have to be careful if they are to survive the jungle out there. They must not be led into making bogus investments. Bogus means something that is not real. Nobody is sure how the word got started. But it began to appear in American newspapers in the 1800s. A newspaper in Boston, Massachusetts, said the word came from a criminal whose name was Borghese. Borghese wrote checks to people although he did not have enough money in the bank. After he wrote the checks, he would disappear. So, people who were paid with his checks received nothing. The newspaper said Americans shortened and changed the criminal's name Borghese to Bogus. People trying to earn money must be also aware of the risk of being ripped off. A writer for a magazine said he first saw the expression used in 1971. It was on a sign that a student carried during a protest demonstration at a university. The message on the sign was that the student felt cheated. To be successful, a person in business works hard and tries to get down to brass tacks. This expression means to get to the bottom or the most important part of something. For example, a salesman may talk about his product without saying the price. You get down to brass tacks when you say, \"it sounds good, but how much does it cost?\" Word expert Charles Funk thinks the expression comes from sailors on ships. They clean the bottom of a boat. When they have removed all the dirt, they are down to the copper pieces that hold the ship together. So, if we get down to brass tacks, we can prevent rip-offs and bogus ways of earning money in that jungle out there. And, some good luck will help, too.

The breakthrough, which scientists say is the first new way to generate electricity in 160 years, could lead to batteries that use water instead of poisonous substances. The scientists made the discovery when they were investigating what happens when tap water is forced through extremely narrow glass tubes. Water squeezed down the tubes, each of which was narrower than a tenth the thickness of a human hair, generating a small electric current that ran the length of the tube. To produce a larger electric current, the team tried forcing water through a glass water filter that contained thousands of narrow channels lined up side by side. \"When we took a syringe of water and squeezed it through the filter, we got enough power to light a light bulb,\" said Larry Kostiuk of the University of Alberta in Canada. \"The harder you push the syringe, the more electric current you get.\" The current is produced because of an effect in the glass tubes. When they are filled with water, positively charged ions fixed in the tubes are washed away, leaving a slight negative charge on the glass surface. When water is then forced along the tube, the surface _ negatively charged ions in the water while positively charged ions are attracted down the tube. The result is a net flow of positively charged ions that sets up an electric current. According to Dr Kostiuk, no one has ever thought to use water to produce electricity in this way. \"The last time someone came up with a way of generating electricity was Michael Faraday in 1839,\" he said. \"So this is the first new way of generating electricity in 160 years, which is why we are so excited about it.\" Dr Kostiuk says water batteries might one day be used to power mobile phones and calculators, but admitted that the engineering challenges might make other applications more realistic. \"You'd need to be sure it wouldn't leak, and you'd need to make sure it wouldn't freeze,\" he said.

Thus, each student gets half an hour of driving time per outing. The instructor and the \"driver\" sit in the front seats and the other three students sit in the back. The cars for drivers' education are different from other ears. In this kind of car there are two sets of brakes, one on the driver's side and the other on the instructor; s side. Thus, if the student driver runs into difficulties, the instructor can take over. This kind of car also has another special feature. On the rear window of the car is a sign that reads: STUDENT DRIVER. That lets nearby drivers know that they should be more careful because the student driver isn't very experienced. After the student has passed the drivers' education course and reached the proper age to drive, they can go to a designated state office to take the driving test, which is made up of an eye examination, a written test, and a road test. The student must pass all the three tests in order to get a driver's license.

But as a study shows, the act of giving ourselves mental messages can help us learn and perform at our best. Researchers have identified the most effective forms of self-talk, collected here -- so that the next time you talk to yourself, you know exactly what you should say. Self-talk isn't just motivational messages like \"You can do it!\" or \"Almost there,\" although this inside cheering section can give us confidence. A review of more than two dozen studies, published last year in the journal Perspectives on Psychological Science,found that there's another kind of mental message that is even more useful, called \"instructional self-talk.\" This is the kind of running description we engage in when we're carrying out a difficult task, especially one that's unfamiliar to us. Think about when you were first learning to drive. Your self-talk might have gone something like this: \"Foot on the gas pedal , hands on the wheel, slow down for the bend here, now put your blinker on...\" Over time, of course, giving yourself instructions becomes unnecessary -- but while you're learning, it does three important things. First, it promotes our attention, focusing us on the important part of the task and keeping out distractions. Second, it helps us manage our effort and make decisions about what to do, how to do it, and when. And third, self-talk allows us to control our cognitive and reactions, making us stay on tasks. In a recent study of students learning to throw darts  in a gym class, Athanasios Kolovelonis and his colleagues at the University of Thessaly in Greece found that self-talk is most effective when involved in a cycle of thought and action. First comes forethought, when you set a goal for yourself and make a plan for how to get there. That's followed by performance, when you enact the plan to the best of your ability. Last comes self-reflection, when you carefully evaluate what you've done and adjust your plan for the next time. Self-talk can play a key part in this cycle. During the forethought stage, consider carefully what you'll say to yourself. You can even write them down. Repeat these self-instructions during the performance stage. With practice, you may find that your self-instructions become shorter; research has found that these words can become powerful signals.  After the action is over, consider how you might change your self-talk to improve your performance next time -- so that at the moment it matters, the right words are ringing in your ears.

I am getting so clumsy  in my old age.\" Everyone had a good laugh, and soon we were all telling stories of our most embarrassing moments. It came around to Frank, who sat quietly listening to the others. Someone said, \"Come on, Frank. Tell us your most embarrassing moment.\" Frank laughed and began to tell us of his childhood. \"I grew up in San Pedro. My Dad was a fisherman, and he loved the sea. He had his own boat, but it was hard making a living on the sea. He worked hard and would stay out until he caught enough to feed the family. Not just enough for our family, but also for his Mom and Dad and the other kids that were still at home.\" He looked at us and said, \"I wish you could have met my Dad. He was a big man, and he was strong from pulling the nets and fighting the seas for his catch. When you got close to him, he smelled like the ocean. He would wear his old canvas, foul-weather coat and his bibbed overalls. His rain hat would be pulled down over his brow. No matter how much my mother washed them, they would still smell of the sea and of fish.\" Frank's voice dropped a bit. \"When the weather was bad he would drive me to school. He had this old truck that he used in his fishing business. That truck was older than he was. It would wheeze and rattle down the road. You could hear it coming for blocks. As he would drive toward the school, I would shrink   down into the seat hoping to disappear. Half the time, he would slam to a stop and the old truck would belch   a cloud of smoke.

Holiday eaters were urged to \"clean their plates\" and were asked to take leftover food home in \"doggy bags.\" The impetus behind the campaign was the startling government statistic that over 200 billion yuan is spent every year on food that ends up in the garbage bin.

The \"clean your plate\" campaign is part of a worldwide effort to stop precious food from being wasted.

{"answer": 0, "choices": ["48 minutes.", "45 minutes.", "80 minutes.", "20 minutes."], "question": "Convection vs. Conventional Ovens  If you are in the market for a new oven and you've already begun shopping for one, you've probably noticed that there are a few different types. Two of the most popular oven types are conventional and convection. The difference in these two types of ovens is the way in which the heat in the oven is spread during the cooking process.  Convection ovens  A convection oven uses a fan which is usually located on the back side of the oven. The purpose of the fan is to force the heated air inside of the oven and circulate it around the item being cooked. The heater air is constantly pushed over and around the food, and therefore a convection oven cooks food much faster than a conventional oven.   Not only does a convection oven cook food more quickly than a conventional oven, but it can also thoroughly cook food at lower temperatures. The average amount of time saved when cooking with a convection oven is about 20 percent of the food's normal cooking time. The temperature a convection oven uses to cook food is also about 20 percent lower than a recipe's suggested cooking temperature.   Convection ovens are speedier and more efficient than conventional ovens, and therefore may be more expensive. However, professional chefs from around the world swear by them and rely on them for delicious tasting food. Also, since the air circulation in a convection oven is the same throughout, food will cook at the same rate no matter where it is placed in the oven....on the top or bottom rack or near the front or back.  Conventional Oven Traditionally, most personal residences in the United States come equipped with a modern conventional oven. These are the most common types of household ovens, and are used every day to cook all sorts of meals, desserts, breads, and many other types of food. Conventional ovens are similar to convection ovens in that they both cook food using heat. They both have the ability to use either gas or electricity, depending on the hook-up in a home. Some may use either gas or electricity simply depending on what is plugged in to them, and some are made to be either gas specific or electricity specific.  In a conventional oven, the heat circulation in the oven can become blocked by pots and pans inside of the oven, which will result in uneven cooking. Uneven cooking is especially noticeable when both the bottom and top racks in the oven are being used at the same time. The items on top will cook faster because heat rises to the tops and when there is a lot in the oven, the heat gets trapped there.   There are pros and cons to both conventional and convection ovens. Conventional ovens have been serving people for years and years and food has been cooked successfully in them for many decades.

Apparently girls read more in general,but more fiction in particular .You could say that there are more opportunities for girls to read fiction:magazines encourage the fiction habit in girls in their early teens,and by their late teens they have probably moved on to the adult women's magazines.Teenage boys tend to buy magazines about their hobbies:motorcycles,heavy transport and to on. Adult reading tastes are also the subject of research.Again the number of women who read for pleasure is considerably higher than the number of men. It seems that the majority of women still want love stories.There has also been some analysis of what men actually read Apparently only 38 percent of men read anything,but 50 percent of what they read is fiction in the form of action-packed stories of space or gunmen It can be inferred from the passage that  _  .", "subject": ""}

Yang works for a software company in Zhongguancun. He dreams of such a life, away from poverty, and that hope has kept him in Beijing for three years since he graduated from university. Soon Yang squeezes his way off the bus to the reality of his life: his home--a 10-square-metre room that costs 550 yuan(81 US dollars) or about one-fifth of his salary in rent every month. It's very cold inside the house as it has no central heating system. He has to stand the long and cold winter. Determined to achieve his dream, Yang says he has changed jobs \"numerous\" times in the past three years and is considering quitting his present job. Yang's frustration over his life as a migrant  is shared by many other graduates that have moved into big cities. Together they have come to be called the \"ant tribe\", a term created by Chinese sociologists to describe the struggles of young migrants, who, armed with their diplomas, flood to big cities in hopes of a better life only to put up with low-paying jobs and poor living conditions. They share every similarity with ants. They live in colonies in crowded areas. They're intelligent and hardworking, yet unknown and underpaid. The term, sociologists have said, also reflects their helplessness in a world governed by the law of the concrete jungle--only the strongest survive. A survey in Ant TribeII found nearly 30 percent of the \"ants\" are graduates of famous key universities--almost three times the percentage of 2009. Most have degrees in popular majors, such as medicine, engineering, economics and management. In addition, 7.2 percent of the \"ants\" have at least a master's degree compared to 1.6 percent in 2009. Most said the economic recovery did not really improve their financial situations, and 66 percent said their incomes fell short of their expectations, the survey also found.

Lian predicts that an increasingly challenging job market will see the ant tribe growing further in number.

The ant tribe's embarrassing living situations have become a serious social issue, and the government should develop \"second-and-third-tier cities\" to attract more graduates from big cities.

{"answer": 3, "choices": ["Texas", "Kansas.", "Ohio", "California."], "question": "Climate change will increase U.S wildfires, and the smoky air will cause terrible problems in areas far beyond those burned, reports an environmental group Thursday.      Two-thirds of Americans, or nearly 212 million, lived in states suffering from wildfire smoke three years ago, according to the report by the Natural Resources Defense Council (NRDC). These areas, which had smoke for at least a week, were nearly 50 times greater than those burned directly by fire. \" It affects a much wider area of the United States than people have realized, \" says author Kim Knowlton, a Columbia University health professor, adding the smoke can move up to hundreds of miles. She says the smoke contains air pollution and can cause several kinds of disease. Texas was hit hardest in 2011, when smoke stayed for at least a week in areas that are home to 25 million people, according to NRDC's report. Illinois, which recorded no wildfires within its borders( ) ,ranked ( ) second with nearly 12 million people affected by smoke that moved in from elsewhere. The other eight states with the most people exposed ( ) to smoky air were, in descending ( ) order: Florida, Missouri, Georgia, Louisiana, Michigan, Alabama, Oklahoma and Iowa. Nearly two dozen states had no wildfires within their borders in 2011, but eight of them still had at least one week of smoky air: Illinois, Missouri, Iowa, Kansas, Nebraska, Indiana, Wisconsin and Ohio.

Two-thirds of Americans, or nearly 212 million, lived in states suffering from wildfire smoke three years ago, according to the report by the Natural Resources Defense Council (NRDC). These areas, which had smoke for at least a week, were nearly 50 times greater than those burned directly by fire. \" It affects a much wider area of the United States than people have realized, \" says author Kim Knowlton, a Columbia University health professor, adding the smoke can move up to hundreds of miles. She says the smoke contains air pollution and can cause several kinds of disease. Texas was hit hardest in 2011, when smoke stayed for at least a week in areas that are home to 25 million people, according to NRDC's report. Illinois, which recorded no wildfires within its borders( ) ,ranked ( ) second with nearly 12 million people affected by smoke that moved in from elsewhere. The other eight states with the most people exposed ( ) to smoky air were, in descending ( ) order: Florida, Missouri, Georgia, Louisiana, Michigan, Alabama, Oklahoma and Iowa. Nearly two dozen states had no wildfires within their borders in 2011, but eight of them still had at least one week of smoky air: Illinois, Missouri, Iowa, Kansas, Nebraska, Indiana, Wisconsin and Ohio. Only 18 states and the District of Columbia had no people exposed to at least a week of smoke that year, although five of them----Alaska, California, Hawaii, Nevada and Utah---had a large area burned by wildfires.

Two of the gases are accumulating at a rate that is causing concern among researchers.      Worries over the growing ozone hole have seen the production of chlorofluorocarbon (CFC) gases restricted since the mid 1980s. But the precise origin of these new, similar substances remains a mystery.      Lying in the atmosphere, the ozone layer plays a critical role in blocking harmful UV rays, which cause cancers in humans and reproductive problems in animals.       Scientists from the British Antarctic Survey were the first to discover a huge \"hole\" in the ozone over Antarctica in 1985. The evidence quickly pointed to CFC gases, which were invented in the 1920s, and were widely used in refrigeration. Extraordinarily, global action was rapidly agreed to deal with CFCs and the Montreal Protocol to limit these substances came into being in 1987. A total global ban on production came into force in 2010.      Now, the newly discovered four new gases can destroy ozone and are getting into the atmosphere from as yet unidentified sources. Three of the gases are CFCs and one is a hydrochlorofluorocarbon (HCFC), which can also damage ozone.      The research has shown that four gases were not around in the atmosphere at all until the 1960s, which suggests they are man-made. The scientists discovered the gases by analyzing polar snow pack. Air from this snow is a natural archive of what was in the atmosphere up t0 100 years ago. The researchers also looked at modern air samples, collected at remote Cape Grim in Tasmania.      They estimate that about 74,000 tonnes of these gases have been released into the atmosphere. Two of the gases are accumulating at significant rates. However, they don't know where the new gases are being released from and this should be investigated. Possible sources include chemicals  for insecticide  production and solvents   for cleaning electronic components. The three CFCs are being destroyed very slowly in the atmosphere - so even if emissions  were to stop immediately, they will still be around for many decades to come.      Of the four species identified, CFC-113a seems the most worrying as there is a very small but growing emission source somewhere, maybe from agricultural insecticides.

As always, it was a busy one, for \"Six days shall you labor and all your work\" was taken seriously back then. Outside, Father and Mr. Patrick next door were busy chopping firewood. Inside their own houses, Mother and Mrs. Patrick were engaged in spring cleaning. Somehow the boys had slipped away to the back lot with their kites. Now, even at the risk of having brother caught to beat carpets, they had sent him to the kitchen for more string . It seemed there was  no limit to the heights to which kites would fly today. My mother looked at the sitting room, its furniture disordered for a thorough sweeping. Again she cast a look toward the window. \"Come on, girls! Let's take string to the boys and watch them fly the kites a minute.\" On the way we met Mrs. Patric, laughing guiltily as if she were doing something wrong, together with her girls. There never was such a day for flying kites! We played all our fresh string into the boys' kites and they went up higher and higher. We could hardly distinguish the orange-colored spots of the kites. Now and then we slowly pulled one kite back, watching it dancing up and down in the wind, and finally bringing it down to earth, just for the joy of sending it up again. Even our fathers dropped their tools and joined us. Our mothers took their turn, laughing like schoolgirls. I think _ . Parents forgot their duty and their dignity; children forgot their everyday fights and little jealousies. \"Perhaps it's like this in the kingdom of heaven,\" I thought confusedly.

They are too small to be seen in a microscope, but they are very important. Each set of genes in the body contains all the instructions needed to make a human being. Some genes determine hair color. Some determine the shape of a nose. Some genes help determine your height and even your weight. Genes are made of a chemical called DNA-the letters stand for deoxyribonucleic acid . In the early 1950's, two scientists, Francis Crick and James Watson, figured out how the parts of DNA fit together. Once scientists understood this structure, it became possible to take pieces of DNA apart and put them together in new ways. New kinds of genes could be made in this manner. Scientists have studied the genes of many plants and animals. They have worked out which genes affect the color of a tomato and the thickness of its skin. Working out which genes determine which features is called genetic mapping, scientists have begun the Human Genome Project, an ambitious effort to map all the genes in the human body. Some genes may be defective . For example, something might be wrong with the gene that makes blood clot . A baby born with this defective gene could suffer serious hemorrhages  or even bleed to death because his or her blood fails to clot. If scientists ever learn how to map all the genes in our bodies, they can determine whether or not an unborn child has any defective genes. They might even discover how to treat these genes before the child is born. What is the main idea of this passage?", "subject": ""}

The 17-strong team of European and African tropical disease researchers, ecologists and anthropologists have spent three weeks investigating the outbreak of the disease in Guinea, Liberia, Ivory Coast and Nigeria. The researchers captured the bats and other creatures near the village of Meliandoua in remote eastern Guinea, where the disease began in December 2013. The boy was bitten and passed the infection on to his mother and both died within a week. The disease was then spread far and wide by the people who came to the funeral.

The team, led by epidemiologist  Herr Leendertz, a disease ecologist at the Robert Koch Institute in Berlin, are expected to publish their results in a major journal soon.

The 17-strong team of European and African tropical disease researchers, ecologists and anthropologists have spent three weeks investigating the outbreak of the disease in Guinea, Liberia, Ivory Coast and Nigeria. The researchers captured the bats and other creatures near the village of Meliandoua in remote eastern Guinea, where the disease began in December 2013. The boy was bitten and passed the infection on to his mother and both died within a week. The disease was then spread far and wide by the people who came to the funeral. Most of the previous outbreaks have been caused by meat from dead infected animals collected by hunters who then sell it on. Fruit bats, however, are widely eaten in rural West Africa. The team, led by epidemiologist  Herr Leendertz, a disease ecologist at the Robert Koch Institute in Berlin, are expected to publish their results in a major journal soon. Herr Leendertz's team believe that an infected straw-colored fruit bat brought the disease to Guinea. The mammals are known to travel long distances and usually settle in forests near cities.

At least, that is the conclusion reached by scientists the University of Oxford in the U.K. and the University of Queensland in Australia, following an extensive study of the archerfish  , a species of tropical fish that can be found all the way from India to Indonesia, the Philippines, and Australia. The ability to distinguish between human faces is a complex task. That's because we all have the same basic features -- two eyes sitting above a nose and a mouth. It's only the subtle differences that make humans distinct from one another. Since this requires a combination of both visual sense and memory, researchers had always assumed that _ was a skill possessed only by those with complicated brains, i.e., humans, a few select animals -- such as horses, cows, dogs, monkeys and some birds, like pigeons. To test if this assumption was accurate, a team of scientists led by Dr. Cait Newport, Marie Curie Research Fellow in the Department of Zoology at Oxford University, decided to study fish. The aquatic   animals have small brains that lack the neocortex , or neocortex-like structure, believed to help recognize the subtle differences between human facial features. The team began by presenting four archerfish with images of two human faces. Initially, the fish spat randomly at both. However, they soon learned that pouring water at the one selected by the researchers earned them a food treat. After that, they focused primarily on that image. The researchers then took the experiment one step further, by introducing 44 other human faces to the mix. To the researcher's astonishment, the trained archerfish were able to recall the learned image almost 81% of the time. And this accuracy improved to 86% when the researchers made the identification even harder, by replacing the colored photos with a set of black and white images and hiding the shape of the head.

An initiative started last fall by the Obama administration could help families go beyond these limited, and far too easily exploited, indexes to learn quickly and easily how a college is compared with its competitors nationally on important criteria like graduation rates, what a degree actually costs and how much debt a student can expect to run up by graduation day. If the federal government makes it legally necessary to disclose this information in a clear and consistent way, as it should, families will be better able to make informed college choices. And this will help put pressure on colleges that perform poorly to improve. Critics may regard this initiative as an example of government overreach. But given that the federal government spends nearly $190 billion a year on higher education aid to students, it has a legitimate interest in making sure that the money flows to the schools that best meet their responsibilities to families and students. Congress has taken some steps to require greater transparency from colleges. The 1990 Student Right to Know Act, for example, required colleges and universities that receive federal aid to disclose graduation rates. And the 2008 Higher Education Opportunity Act required schools to offer a way for consumers to determine actual costs after student aid is taken into account. But many colleges have done a poor job of obeying federal disclosure rules, and much of the available information is not in one place. The administration's new efforts would enforce reporting requirements and provide some new tools. President Obama wants to expand campus-based aid to about $10 billion from the current $2.7 billion. He has proposed moving money away from colleges that fail to control tuition increases or provide good value to others that do a better job. That is a worthy idea in principle, but he will need strong data-based evidence to determine how colleges are doing. The transparency initiatives are a good place to start and should be embraced by both parties in Congress.

Ann's prize includes a $25,000 scholarship and a \"once-in-a-lifetime experience\" from either the European Organization for Nuclear Research, Lego or Google for her Hollow Flashlight, which has no moving parts or batteries. Ann created the flashlight for a local science fair. The inspiration for the invention came from seeing unwanted batteries and after visits to the Philippines, where she saw the need for a battery-free flashlight. A friend at school there failed in her studies because of a lack of electricity and light to study when it became dark. In her project, Ann wrote that she \"made two flashlights that do not use any batteries, harmful chemicals, or kinetic energy  . They do not create any noise and will always work. The flashlight's only limitation is its need for at least a 5degC temperature difference to provide usable light.\" A You Tube video of Ann explaining how she created the flashlight has been viewed more than 1.4 million times. Despite her success, the private school student is undecided about her career path. Ann hopes she can find a way to combine her love of film with science. The four winners were chosen from 15 finalists from eight countries. The contest attracted thousands of entries from students in 120 countries.

Leaving their _  , many of them are to take their first step into the world of adulthood, attending fast-paced, crowded universities, taking up part-time or full-time employment. Many may even move from family homes in their pursuit of educational fulfillment or the \"perfect\" job opportunity. One ceremony that has become part of coming of age has been the senior prom  . The senior prom is an opportunity for youth to celebrate the entrance into the world of adulthood with color and formality. However, there is far more behind the social event than ever noticed. What is formal? Formal means to present one's self to others in a way which is \"with form\", with shape, polite, inoffensive and organized. We see the example of a formal letter; it uses proper grammar and sentence structure in order to be respectful, while at the same time serving a purpose or getting an important message across. In our society, what is formal? Very little. On average, clothing, language, behavior --- all is very informal. Individuals who are formal (polite, inoffensive, organized) in their daily dealings with people are often looked upon as boring. Yet in certain situations, individuals play with the concept of formality not truly to achieve respectfulness and order but because it becomes fashionable to do so. While a prom may seem, on the surface, like a fun opportunity to behave formally, it is actually a flowery version of Halloween. On the occasion of the spring prom, we see flowering youth taking on the formalities of \"adult\". Fine dress, careful makeup, luxury cars all become part of being an adult. But being \"adult\" isn't that way. In our society we have a wrong idea of what adulthood actually is. It has always been my understanding that adulthood and maturity   are not based upon one's ability to hold a cigarette in a certain way or tie a bow tie. Adulthood comes with understanding of one's place in the universe; it comes with the knowledge of how to interact with our fellow human beings; it comes with the ability to take responsibility for one's own actions --- whether good or bad.

What used to be fun and different becomes boring. That is the time to look for something new. It is the time for a big idea to get your mind off everyday life. So why not search for extraterrestrial   intelligence? Or even better, why not get your computer to do it for you? Over two million people have joined the Search for Extraterrestrial Intelligence(SETI)project. Based in California, the SETI project analyzes information taken from a giant radio telescope based in South America. Its task is to look for signals from outer space that might prove that life exists on other planets. Processing this information is far too big a job for one computer.

And I hated circuses, especially the animal acts -- men teasing lions, girls balancing on elephants and monkeys playing football. I knew that every trick a circus animal did was unnatural, achieved through strict training and quite possibly cruelty. Happily, during my lifetime public attitudes and the law have changed. Circuses using wild animals are now almost extinct, and zoos have definitely evolved. When my children were young, I occasionally took them to our local zoo. The elephants were in tiny cages and the gorillas looked bored as they sat peeling bananas and staring at teasing visitors. Each cage had a sign which listed the animal's name and where it came from. But, back then, there was little information included about the environmental challenges they faced. As a result, environmentalists and animal lovers often oppose zoos. \"Animals belong in the wild,\" is a common -- and understandable -- complaint. But what do the animals themselves prefer? Generally speaking, zoo animals have a longer life. But -- you may protest -- they are not free. What? Free to be hunted and killed, free to die of hunger or thirst?

{"answer": 0, "choices": ["Hungarian", "Spanish", "Italian", "English"], "question": "Have you ever found yourself in this situation: You hear a song you used to sing when you were a child - a bit of nostalgia  or \"blast from the past,\" as we say. But it is not a distant childhood memory. The words come back to you as clearly as when you sang them all those years ago. Researchers at the University of Edinburgh studied the relationship between music and remembering a foreign language. They found that remembering words in a song was the best way to remember even one of the most difficult languages. Here is what they did. Researchers took 60 adults and randomly divided them into three groups of 20. Then they gave the groups three different types of \"listen-and-repeat\" learning conditions. Researchers had one group simply speak the words. They had the second group speak the words to a rhythm, or beat. And they asked the third group to sing the words. All three groups studied words from the Hungarian language for 15 minutes. Then they took part in a series of language tests to see what they remembered. Why Hungarian, you ask? Researchers said they chose Hungarian because not many people know the language. It does not share any roots with Germanic or Romance languages, such as Italian or Spanish. After the tests were over, the singers came out on top. The people who learned these new Hungarian words by singing them showed a higher overall performance. They did the best in four out of five of the tests. They also performed two times better than those who simply learned the words by speaking them. Dr. Katie Overy says singing could lead to new ways to learn a foreign language. The brain likes to remember things when they are contained in a catchy 3, or memorable 4, tune 5. Dr. Ludke said the findings could help those who struggle to learn foreign languages. On the University of Edinburgh's website Dr. Ludke writes, \"This study provides the first experimental evidence that a listen-and-repeat singing method can support foreign language learning, and opens the door for future research in this area.\" According to the passage which language doesn't share the same root with Germanic or Romance languages?", "subject": ""}

However, there's a special minority who takes paper art to the next level, magically turning the plain white or colored paper into some of the most amazing artworks. Check out the following artists and their works! The Danish artist Peter Callesen is famous for his talent in combining the minimalism   of a white sheet of paper with the complexity of carefully cut and folded paper and uses the two to build out some pleasing works. The British artist Su Blackwell often goes to secondhand bookstores -- to look for materials with which she can carve out delicate sculptures. The models look as if they \"grow\" naturally from the pages of the books. The artist finds inspiration from the book title or a paragraph or picture inside and then spends months carefully making each one into an eye-catching paper model. Her old book sculptures sell for up toPS5,000 each. By carefully folding simple pieces of paper, German artist Simon Schubert creates amazing masterpieces. He turns paper into architectural masterpieces by folding a simple piece of paper to shape the creases  , then unfolding it to show the fascinating artwork. Another master of paper-folding is Jen Stark. Her artwork is often in the form of colorful caves and land maps.

However, there's a special minority who takes paper art to the next level, magically turning the plain white or colored paper into some of the most amazing artworks. Check out the following artists and their works! The Danish artist Peter Callesen is famous for his talent in combining the minimalism   of a white sheet of paper with the complexity of carefully cut and folded paper and uses the two to build out some pleasing works. The British artist Su Blackwell often goes to secondhand bookstores -- to look for materials with which she can carve out delicate sculptures. The models look as if they \"grow\" naturally from the pages of the books. The artist finds inspiration from the book title or a paragraph or picture inside and then spends months carefully making each one into an eye-catching paper model. Her old book sculptures sell for up toPS5,000 each. By carefully folding simple pieces of paper, German artist Simon Schubert creates amazing masterpieces. He turns paper into architectural masterpieces by folding a simple piece of paper to shape the creases  , then unfolding it to show the fascinating artwork. Another master of paper-folding is Jen Stark. Her artwork is often in the form of colorful caves and land maps. Using her imagination and a special knife, she is a modern day magician who turns _ materials like construction paper and glue into fantastic, complicated sculptures that puzzle the eyes. Her work draws inspiration from nature. According to the passage, Jen Stark   _  .", "subject": ""}
{"answer": 3, "choices": ["Their work requires greater intelligence.", "They are under constant pressure at work.", "They work harder than most other people.", "They have studied for years to get qualified."], "question": "One of the most difficult questions to answer is how much a job is worth. We naturally expect that a doctor's salary will be higher than a bus conductor's wages. But the question becomes much more difficult to answer when we compare a miner with an engineer, or an unskilled man working on an oil-rig with a teacher in a secondary school. What the doctor, the engineer and the teacher have in common is that they have devoted several years to studying in order to obtain the necessary qualifications for their professions. We feel instinctively that these skills and these years should be rewarded. At the same time we recognize that the work of the miner and the oil-rig laborer is both hard and dangerous, and that they must be highly paid for the risks they take. Another aspect we must take into consideration is how socially useful a man's work is. Most people would agree that looking after the sick or teaching children is more important than, say, selling second-hand cars. Yet it is almost certain that the used-car salesman earns more than the nurse and the schoolteacher. Indeed, this whole question of just rewards can be turned on its head. You can argue that a man who does a job which brings him personal satisfaction is already receiving part of his reward in the form of a so-called \"psychic wage\", and that it is the man with the boring, repetitive job who needs more money to make up for the soul-destroying repetitiveness of his work. It is significant that the jobs like nursing and teaching continue to be poorly paid, while others, such as those in the world of sport or entertainment, carry financial rewards out of all proportion to their social worth. Although the amount of money that people earn is largely determined by market forces, this should not prevent us from seeking some way to decide what is the right pay for the job. A starting point would be to try to decide the ratio which ought to exist between the highest and the lowest paid. The picture is made more complicated by two factors: firstly by the welfare benefits which every citizen receives, and secondly by the taxation system which is often used as an instrument of social justice by taxing high incomes at a very high rate indeed. Most countries now regard a ratio of 7:1 as socially acceptable. If it is less, the highly-qualified people carrying heavy responsibilities will become disappointed, and might even end up by leaving for another country. If it is more, the difference between rich and poor will be so great that it will lead to social unrest. Why do people naturally expect that doctors should be well-paid?", "subject": ""}

In the United States, the legal blood alcohol limit is 0.08% for people aged 21 years or older, while people under 21 are not allowed to drive a car with any level of alcohol in their body. A \"positive\" test result, a result over the legal limit, allows the police to arrest the driver. However, many people who tested positive on the test have claimed that they only drank a \"non-alcoholic\" energy drink. Can one of these energy drinks really cause someone to test positive on an ABT? Researchers in Missouri set up an experiment to find out. First, the amount of alcohol in 27 different popular energy drinks was measured. All but one had an alcohol level greater than 0.005%. In nine of the 27 drinks, the alcohol level was at least 0.096%.The scientists then investigated the possibility that these small levels of alcohol could be discovered by an ABT. They asked test _ to drink a full can or bottle of an energy drink and then gave each subject an ABT one minute and 15 minutes after the drink was finished. For 11 of the 27energy drinks, the ABT did find the presence of alcohol if the test was given within one minute after the drink was taken. However, alcohol could not be discovered for any of the drinks if the test was given 15 minutes after the drink was consumed. This shows that when the test is taken plays an important role in the test result.

Working in the reputable world of journalism, I told photographers to cover other people's difficult life situations.I justified marching into moments of sadness, under the appearance of the reader's right to know.I worked with professionals talking their way into situations or shooting from behind police lines.And I wasn't alone. In any American town, after a car crash or some other horrible incident when ordinary people are hurt or killed, you rarely see photographers pushing past rescue workers to take photos of the blood and injuries.But you are likely to see local newspaper and television photographers on the scene -and fast ... How can we justify doing this? Journalists are taught to separate, doing the job from worrying about the consequences of publishing what they record.Repeatedly, they are reminded of a news-business saying: Leave your conscience in the office, A victim may lie bleeding, unconscious, or dead.Your job is to record the image.You're a photographer, not an emergency medical worker.You put away your feelings and document the scene. But catastrophic events often bring out the worst in photographers and photo editors.In the first minutes and hours after a disaster occurs, photo agencies buy pictures.They rush to obtain the rights to be the only one to own these shocking images and death is usually the subject.Often, an agency buys a picture from a local newspaper or an amateur photographer and puts it up for bid by major magazines.The most sought-after special pictures command tens of thousands of dollars through bidding contests. I worked on all those stories and many like them.When they happen, you move quickly: buying, dealing, trying to beat the agencies to the pictures.

{"answer": 3, "choices": ["Income.", "Faith.", "Education.", "Donation."], "question": "Americans gave nearly $300 billion away last year. Do you know the reason? Beyond the noble goals of helping others, it is that giving will make them happier. It is a fact that givers are happier people than non-givers. According to the Social Capital Community Benchmark Survey, a survey of 30,000 American households, people who give money to charity are 43% more likely than non-givers to say they are \"very happy\" about their lives. Similarly, volunteers are 42% more likely to be very happy then non-volunteers. The happiness difference between givers and non-givers is not due to differences in their personal characteristics, such as income or religion. Imagine two people who are identical in terms of income and faith, as well as age, education, politics, sex, and family circumstances, but one donates money and volunteers, while the other does not. The giver will be, on average, over 40 percentage points more likely to be very happy than the non-givers. A number of studies have researched exactly why charity leads to happiness. The surprising conclusion is that giving affects our brain chemistry. For example, people who give often report feelings of euphoria, which psychologists have referred to as the \"Helper's High\". They believe that charitable activity produces a very mild version of the sensations people get from drugs like morphine and heroin. Of course, not only does giving increase our happiness, but also our happiness increases the possibility that we will give. Everyone prefers to give more when they are happy. Researchers have investigated this by conducting experiments in which people are asked about their happiness before and after they participate in a charitable activity, such as volunteering to help children or serving meals to the poor.

In the late 19th century,the most common way to hold papers together was by using a pin.Although the pin was an inexpensive tool and was easily removable,it would 1eave holes in the paper. Later,as steel wire became more common,inventors began to notice its elastic feature. With this feature,it could be stretched and twisted into various clip--like objects.In the years just before 1900,quite a few paperclip designs appeared.The name most frequently associated with the paperclip invention is Johan Vaaler,a Norwegian inventor. However, Vaaler's clips were not the same as the paperclips currently in use.Specifically,they did not have the inside loop we see today.The familiar looped design was invented by Gem Manufacturing Ltd.in England.This clip is therefore sometimes known as the Gem clip. Because of Vaaler,the paperclip played an important historical role in Norway.During World War II,Norway was occupied by the Nazis.Norwegians were prohibited from wearing any symbol of their national unity ,such as buttons with the initials of their king.Thus,in protest,they started wearing paperclips to show their unity.The reason for doing this was simple:Paperclips were a Norwegian invention whose original function was to bind together.After the war,a giant paperclip statue was put up in Oslo to honour Vaaler--even though his design was never actually produced.

The total consumer debt in the United States rose 73 percent between 1974 and 1984,as the debt for each man,woman,and child increased from $10,264 to $26,566.Huge debt now is present in our economy at all levels.As a nation,we are more than $7 trillion in debt,and the total keeps increasing astonishingly.  As we have over borrowed,so have we overspent.In late 986,the share of after-tax income that Americans saved sank below 2 percent for a short time,less than half the figure at which we saved only 10 years ago.Americans now are buying from foreigners between about $50 and $100 billion more Mercedes and Toyotas, Paris fashions,and tours to Europe than the Boeing 747s, agriculture machinery , or Kansas wheat that the foreigners bought from America. The country could not produce and pay for all the things it wanted.  To make a long story short, we Americans have serious problems in keeping down spending and keeping up personal savings.It is high time for us American people to learn the basics of long-term money management.

I was born in Rivermouth almost fifty years ago, but, before I became very well acquainted with that pretty New England town, my parents moved to New Orleans. I was only eighteen months old at the time of the move, and it didn't make much difference to me where I was, because several years later, when my father proposed to take me North to be educated, I had my own view on the subject. I instantly kicked over the little boy, Sam, who happened to be standing by me at the moment, and declared that I would not be taken away to live among a lot of Yankees! You see I was what is called \" a Northern man with Southern principles,\" I had no recollection of New England: my earliest memories were connected with the South. I knew I was born in the North, but hoped nobody would find it out. I never told my schoolmates I was a Yankee, because they talked about Yankees in a scornful way which made me feel that it was quite a shame not to be born in the South. And this impression was strengthened by Aunt Chloe, who said, \"There wasn't no gentlemen in the North no way.\" With this picture of Northern civilization in my eye, the readers will easily understand my terror at the bare thought of being transported to Rivermouth to school, and possibly will forgive me for kicking over little Sam, when my father announced this to me. As for kicking little Sam, I always did that, more or less gently, when anything went wrong with me. My father was greatly troubled by this violent behavior. As little Sam picked himself up, my father took my hand in his and led me thoughtfully to the library. He appeared strangely puzzled on learning the nature of my objections to going North. \"Who on earth, Tom, has filled your brain with those silly stories?\" asked my father calmly. \"Aunt Chloe, sir, she told me.\" My father devoted that evening and several evenings to giving me a clear account of New England: its early struggles, its progress, and its present condition. I was no longer unwilling to go North; on the contrary, the proposed journey to a new world full of wonders kept me awake nights. Long before the moving day arrived I was eager to be off. My impatience was increased by the fact that my father had purchased for me a fine little Mustang pony, and shipped it to Rivermouth two weeks before the date set for our own journey. The pony completely resigned me to the situation. The pony's name was Gitana, which is the Spanish for \"gypsy\", so I always called her Gypsy. Finally the time came to leave the vine-covered mansion among the orange-trees, to say goodbye to little Sam(I am convince he was heartily glad to get rid of me), and to part with Aunt Chloe.

I am big and look less energetic. Still, every year or so, someone takes me aside and says, \"You actually are polite, aren't you?\" I'm always thrilled. They noticed. That's the thing. Actually, when we talk about politeness, we usually think of please; thank you; I like your hat; etc. All we need to do is to hear, not to notice. When I was in high school, I read etiquette manuals . No one noticed my politeness except for one kid. He yelled at me about _ . \"It's strange that you are always so polite,\" he said. I took that as praise and made a note to hide my politeness further. Real politeness, I believed, was invisible . It adapted itself to the situation. Politeness leaves door open. I've met so many people whom, if I had trusted my first impressions, I would never have wanted to meet again. Yet many of them are now great friends. One of those people is my wife. On our first date, she told me in detail that she had an operation to remove a cyst  from her body. Of course, it killed the chemistry. But when I walked her home, I told her I'd had a great time. We talked a little after that. I kept everything pleasant and brief. Much later, I learned that she'd been having a very bad day in a very bad year. People silently suffer from all kinds of terrible things. The good thing about politeness is you can regard these people exactly the same and wait to see what happens. You don't have to have an opinion. You don't need to make a judgment. Last week, my two-year-old son, Abraham met a foreign woman in the playground. Out of curiosity, I suppose, he asked, \"What's your name?\" The woman told him. Then he put out his little hand and said, \"Nice to meet you!\" Everyone laughed and he smiled. He shared with his firmest handshake, like I taught him. Why do many people think the author is impolite?", "subject": ""}

Dinner was ready when he came home,In contrast,the modern husband helps his working wife at home.He may do some of the household chores,and it is not unusual for him to cook. The second difference is in the woman's role. In the traditional family,the woman may have worked for miney during her first years of marriage.However,when she gave birth,she would usually give up her job. Her primary role would be to take care of her family and home.In contrast,in many families today,the modern woman works outside the home even after she has children .She's doing two jobs instead of one,so she is busier than the traditional mother was.The traditional wife learned to live within her husband's income.But the modern wife does not have to because the family has two incomes. The final difference is in the role of the children .In the traditional family,the children were taken care of by the mother because she didn't work outside.However,today pre-school children may go to a child-care center or to a baby-sitter regularly because the mother works.The school-age children of a traditional family were more dependent.Their mother was there to help them get ready for school and to make their breakfast.In conrtast,modern children are more independent.They have to get up early and get ready for school themselves,and they may even have to make their own breakfast.

One after another, the next six drivers arriving at the tollbooth were informed, \"Some lady up ahead already paid your fare.\" It turned out that the woman, Natalie Smith, had read something on a friend's refrigerator: \"Practice random kindness and senseless acts of beauty.\" The phrase impressed her so much that she copied it down. Judy Foreman spotted the same phrase on a warehouse wall far away from home. When it stayed on her mind for days, she gave up and drove all the way back to copy it down. \"I thought it was beautiful,\" she said, explaining why she'd taken to writing it at the bottom of all her letters, \"like a message from above.\" Her husband, Frank, liked the phrase so much that he put it up on the classroom wall for his students, one of whom was the daughter of Alice Johnson, a local news reporter. Alice put it in the newspaper, admitting that though she liked it, she didn't know where it came from or what it really meant. Two days later, Alice got a call from Anne Herbert, a woman living in Marin. It was in a restaurant that Anne wrote the phrase down on a piece of paper, after turning it around in her mind for days. \"Here's the idea,\" Anne says. \"Anything you think there should be more of, do it randomly.\" Her fantasies include painting the classrooms of shabby schools, leaving hot meals on kitchen tables in the poor part of town, and giving money secretly to a proud old lady.

{"answer": 0, "choices": ["People seek nature in different ways.", "People should spend most of their lives in the wild.", "People have quite different ideas of nature.", "People must make more efforts to study nature."], "question": "Most of us spend our lives seeking the natural world. To this end, we walk the dog, play golf, go fishing, sit in the garden, drink outside rather than inside the pub, have a picnic, live in the suburbs, go to the seaside, buy a weekend place in the country. The most popular free time activity in Britain is going for a walk. And when joggers   jog, they don't run down the streets. Every one of them automatically heads to the park or the river. It is my firm belief that not only do we all need nature, but we all seek nature, whether we know we are doing so or not. But despite this, our children are growing up nature-deprived  . I spent my boyhood climbing trees. These days, children are robbed of these ancient freedoms, due to problems like crime, traffic, the loss of the open spaces and strange new ideas about what is best for children, that is to say, things that can be bought, rather than things that can be found. The truth is to be found elsewhere. A study in the US: families had moved to better housing and the children were assessed for ADHD  . Those whose housing had more natural views showed an improvement of 19%; those who had the same improvement in material surroundings but no nice view improved just 4%. A study in Sweden indicated that kindergarten children who could play in a natural environment had less illness and greater physical ability than children used only to a normal playground. A US study suggested that when a school gave children access to a natural environment, the entire school would do better in studies. Another study found that children play differently in a natural environment. In playgrounds, children create a hierarchy   based on physical abilities, with the tough ones taking the lead. But when a grassy area was planted with bushes, the children got much more into fantasy play, and the social hierarchy was now based on imagination and creativity. Most bullying   is found in schools where there is a tarmac   playground; the least bullying is in a natural area that the children are encouraged to explore. This reminds me unpleasantly of Sunnyhill School, with its hard tarmac, where I used to hang about in corners dreaming about wildlife. But children are frequently discouraged from involvement with natural spaces, for health and safety reasons, for fear that they might get dirty or that they might cause damage. So, instead, the damage is done to the children themselves: not to their bodies but to their souls. One of the great problems of modern childhood is ADHD, now increasingly and expensively treated with drugs. Yet one study after another indicates that contact with nature gives huge benefits to ADHD children. However, we spend money on drugs rather than on green places. The life of old people is much better when they have access to nature. The most important for the growing population of old people is in quality rather than quantity of years. And study after study finds that a garden is the single most important thing in finding that quality. In wider and more difficult areas of life, there is evidence to indicate that natural surroundings improve all kinds of things. Even problems with crime and aggressive behaviour are reduced when there is contact with the natural world. Dr William Bird, researcher from the Royal Society for the Protection of Birds, states in his study, \"A natural environment can reduce violent behaviour because its process helps reduce anger and behavior that people might regret later.\" Wild places need encouraging for this reason, no matter how small their contribution. We tend to think human beings are doing nature some kind of favour when we are protecting nature. The error here is far too deep: not only do humans need nature for themselves, but the very idea that humanity and the natural world are separable things is damaging. Human beings are a species of animals. For seven million years we lived on the planet as part of nature. So we miss the natural world and long for contact with non-human life. Anyone who has patted a dog, stroked a cat, sat under a tree with a glass of beer, given or received a bunch of flowers or chosen to walk through the park on a nice day, understands that.

One of the great problems of modern childhood is ADHD, now increasingly and expensively treated with drugs. Yet one study after another indicates that contact with nature gives huge benefits to ADHD children. However, we spend money on drugs rather than on green places. The life of old people is much better when they have access to nature. The most important for the growing population of old people is in quality rather than quantity of years. And study after study finds that a garden is the single most important thing in finding that quality. In wider and more difficult areas of life, there is evidence to indicate that natural surroundings improve all kinds of things. Even problems with crime and aggressive behaviour are reduced when there is contact with the natural world. Dr William Bird, researcher from the Royal Society for the Protection of Birds, states in his study, \"A natural environment can reduce violent behaviour because its process helps reduce anger and behavior that people might regret later.\" Wild places need encouraging for this reason, no matter how small their contribution. We tend to think human beings are doing nature some kind of favour when we are protecting nature. The error here is far too deep: not only do humans need nature for themselves, but the very idea that humanity and the natural world are separable things is damaging. Human beings are a species of animals. For seven million years we lived on the planet as part of nature. So we miss the natural world and long for contact with non-human life. Anyone who has patted a dog, stroked a cat, sat under a tree with a glass of beer, given or received a bunch of flowers or chosen to walk through the park on a nice day, understands that.        We need the wild world. It is necessary to our well-being, our health, our happiness. Without other living things around us we are less than human. In what way do elderly people benefit from their contact with nature?", "subject": ""}

In most years, more than five hundred million cases of illness result from the disease, although exact numbers are difficult to assess because many people don't (or can't) seek care. It is not unusual for a family earning less than two hundred dollars a year to spend a quarter of its income on malaria treatment, and what they often get no longer works. In countries like Tanzania, Mozambique, and the Gambia, no family, village, hospital, or workplace can remain unaffected for long. Malaria starts suddenly, with violent chills, which are soon followed by an intense fever and, often, headaches. As the parasites multiply, they take over the entire body. Malaria parasites live by eating the red blood cells they infect. They can also attach themselves to blood vessels in the brain. If it doesn't kill you, malaria can happen again and again for years. The disease passed on to humans by female mosquitoes infected with one of four species of parasite. Together, the mosquito and the parasite are the most deadly couple in the history of the earth--and one of the most successful. Malaria has five thousand genes, and its ability to change rapidly to defend itself and resist new drugs has made it nearly impossible to control. Studies show that mosquitoes are passing on the virus more frequently, and there are more outbreaks in cities with large populations. Some of the disease's spread is due to global warming. For decades, the first-choice treatment for malaria parasites in Africa has been chloroquine, a chemical which is very cheap and easy to make. Unfortunately, in most parts of the world, malaria parasites have become resistant to it.

Research in the sixties found the opposite. Bilingual people scored higher than monolinguals, people who speak only one language. So which is it? Researchers presented their newest studies last month at a meeting of the American Association for the Advancement of Science. The latest evidence shows that being bilingual does not necessarily make people smarter. But researcher Ellen Bialystok says it probably does make you better at certain skills. Ellen Bialystok said, \"Imagine driving down the highway. There're many things that could capture your attention and you really need to be able to monitor all of them. Why would bilingualism make you any better at that?\" And the answer, she says, is that bilingual people are often better at controlling their attention -- a function called the executive control system. Ms. Bialystok is a psychology professor at York University in Toronto, Canada. She says the best method to measure the executive control system is called the Stroop Test. A person is shown words in different color1s. The person has to ignore the word but say the color1. The .problem is that the words are all names of color1s. Ellen Bialystok said, \"So you would have the word blue written in red, but you have to say red.

Several studies suggest people who spend most of their days sitting are more likely to be fat, have a heart attack or even die. While health officials have issued  guidelines advising on the least amounts of physical activities, they haven't suggested people try to limit how much time they spend in a seated position. \"After four hours of sitting, the body starts to send harmful signals,\" said Ekblom-Bak of the Swedish School of Sport and Health Sciences.

The volcano-boarding speed, set by an Israeli woman, is 54 mph. \"Rushing down an active volcano is something that people expect.\" Said Anthony   Alcalde, an expert volcano boarder.

He tried sliding down on surfboards, snowboards, and even a refrgerrator door before inventing a sit-down board made of plywood. \"At first, Darryn planned to use a snowboard,\" said Gemma Cope, a British woman who now runs Big Foot, which offers volcano boarding tours. \"But he realized he couldn't cut an edge for there were little rocks everywhere. So he came up with the sitting-down option and realized he can go pretty fast. \"  Tourists,who are nearly all foreigners,pay $28 for the experience, which begins with a truck ride on dirt roads to Cerro Negr0.a 2,400-foot--high volcano that last erupted in l999.Visitors must carry their boards during the half-hour climb to the top.

In fact, a new study suggests that violence not only leaves long-term scars on children's bodies, but also changes their DNA, causing changes that are equal to seven to ten years of premature aging  . Scientists measured this by studying the ends of children's chromosomes  , called telomeres, says Idan Shalev, lead author of a study published in Molecular Psychiatry. Telomeres are special DNA sequences   which prevent the DNA in chromosomes from separating. They get shorter each time a cell divides, until a cell cannot divide any more and dies. Several factors have been found to shorten telomeres, including smoking, radiation and psychological stresses such as being treated badly when young and taking care of a chronically ill person. In this study, researchers examined whether exposure to violence could make children's telomeres shorten faster than normal. They interviewed the mothers of 236 children at ages 5, 7 and 10, asking whether the youngsters had been exposed to domestic violence between the mother and her partner, physical maltreatment by an adult or bullying. Researchers measured the children's telomeres--in cells obtained from the insides of their cheeks--at ages 5 and 10. Telomeres shortened faster in kids exposed to two or more types of violence, says Shalev. Unless that pattern changes, the study suggests, these kids could be expected to develop diseases of aging, such as heart attacks or memory loss, seven to 10 years earlier than their peers. Shalev says there is hope for these kids. His study found that, in rare cases, telomeres can lengthen. Better nutrition, exercise and stress reduction are three things that may be able to lengthen telomeres, he says.

Movie fans have become used to such events after years of Hollywood films showing disasters, terrorism  and danger, The Empire State Building, the White House, New York City and even the American president himself have all been threatened by terrorist attacks in these exciting films.      The film\"True Lies\", released  in 1994 is considered to be a good example of this kind of movie. The special effects, including explosions and missiles, make the action look like a real thing.  \"Independence Day\"in 1996 took this type of movie one step further by blowing up the White House. This science fiction movie is about a war between human beings and aliens  from another planet. In the movie, the WorldTradeCentertowers are destroyed.  Violence has become a major part of Hollywood movies. And this is what people enjoy. Soon after the attacks, many famous film companies stopped the planned releases of some of their new movies, especially if their films showed terrorist attacks or plane crashes. \"Swordfish\" was top of the American box office in June, 2001.

To meet the needs for the program, a car must be drivable and the owner must meet certain income  restrictions . In order to get help from the program, a motorist must have a family income of no more than 185% of the national poverty guidelines . For a family of four, that would be no more than $32,653 each year. The state program that takes polluting cars off the road has just finished its first year, and people say it has been successful. For the past year, the state program has been buying cars that can't pass the test. Some car owners get as much as $1,000 for their old ones, while others receive as much as $500 for repairs. The cars bought by the States through the program are put out of use and sent to dismantlers . After being bought by the government, a car will be   _  .", "subject": ""}

Swine flu is a contagious  respiratory  disease in pigs. It is caused by a type-A influenza virus. Humans can also catch swine flu. The virus causes regular outbreaks in pigs, but people usually do not catch it. However, there have been cases of the virus spreading to people, and then from one person to another. The symptoms of swine flu are similar to the common flu. They include fever, lethargy  , lack of appetite, coughing, runny nose, sore throat, nausea  , and vomiting  . The high proportion of young adults among the deaths is one of several mysteries about this virus. Most of the dead had lung damage. What caused it is not yet known. The virus spreads the same way the common flu does. When an infected person coughs or sneezes around another person, the latter is put at risk. People can get the disease by touching something with the flu virus on it and then touching their mouth, nose or eyes. There are medicines to treat swine flu.

{"answer": 3, "choices": ["they were of the same age", "they had the same hair styles", "they were both tall", "they were both new students"], "question": "My Best Enemy Once again, I was in a new school. So was a girl in my class named Lisa. That's where the similarities ended. I was tall and she was small. My thick black hair had been recently cut short into an untidy style. Her natural blonde hair flowed to her waist and looked great. I was 12 and one of the oldest in the class while she was 11 and the youngest. I was awkward and shy. She wasn't. I couldn't stand her, considering her my enemy. But she liked me and wanted to be friends. One day, she invited me over and I said yes--I was too shocked to answer any other way. My family had moved six times in six years, and I had never managed to develop any friendships. But this girl who wore the latest fashions wanted me to go home with her after school. She lived in a fun part of town that had two pizza places, an all-night bookstore, a movie theater and a park. As we walked from the school bus stop through her neighborhood, I tried to guess which house might be hers. Was it the white one with the perfect lawn or the three-story house with a front porch? I got very surprised when she led me into an old apartment building. She lived on the fourth floor in a two-room place with her mother,her stepfather, her two brothers and her sister. When we got into the room she shared with her sister, she took out a big case of Babies, which was my next surprise. I had never played with them. We sat on the floor,laughing as we made up crazy stories about the Babies. We found out that we both wanted to be writers when we were older and both had wild imaginations.

In addition to being a hit in the ratings, \"The Voice\" is also a hit with critics and Emmy voters: The second season of the show , which _ from February to May 2012, has earned the 2012 Critics' Choice Award for Best Realty-Series Competition and an Emmy nomination   for Outstanding Reality-Competition Program. All the original coaches are back for the third season in a row: Christina Aguilera, Maroon 5 lead singer Adam Levine, Cee Lo Green and Blake Shelton. The show's other on-air talent returning for Season 3 are host/producer Carson Daly and social media reporter Christina Milian, who has been with the show since Season 2. The grand prize for the winner is also the same: a record deal with Universal Republic Records. The third season of \"The Voice\" features two big new changes: \"steals\", in which the coaches can steal contestants who have been rejected from another coach's team, and \"knockout rounds\". In the \"battle rounds,\" two contestants face off in a duet   of a song chosen by their coach. When a contestant is rejected from a team after a battle round, another coach has the option to \"steal\" the contestant for his or her team. If more than one coach wants the same contestant, then the contestant gets to choose the coach. In the \"knockout rounds,\" two contestants face off by each doing a different song of the contestant's choice, and coaches can no longer \"steal\" a contestant who is rejected. Season 3 will also have a new group of four advisers, who are each paired with a coach: Green Day lead singer with Aguilera; Mary J. Blige with Levine; Michael Buble with Shelton; and Matchbox Twenty lead singer Rob Thomas with Green. At an August 2012 press event held at \"The Voice\" executive producer Mark Burnett's home in Malibu, California, members of the media gathered for a press conference with Burnett, Aguilera, Green, Shelton, Levine, Daly and Milian to discuss changes in the show and what the future holds for \"The Voice.\" On which section of a newspaper will you read this passage?", "subject": ""}

She would go to practice three times a week and try really hard, and I wouldn't make her compete in the swim meets because on the day of a meet, she would be nervous all day. Her nerves rooted from the possibility that she would do something horribly wrong and let everyone down.

(AP) -- A group of black parents and civil rights activists presented a petition  Thursday calling for officials to drop charges against a 16-year-old South Carolina high school student who was videotaped being dragged from her desk and thrown to the floor by a police officer in her classroom. The group said it was unfair and unacceptable that the student and her 18-year-old classmate at Spring Valley High School who taped the incident were the only people charged that day when authorities already knew Richland County Deputy Ben Fields had tossed the girl from her desk to the ground. They also said their petition had hundreds of thousands of names from around the country asking prosecutor Dan Johnson to drop the \"disturbing schools\" charges against the teens. The students in the case are black; Fields is white. Johnson issued a statement Wednesday saying he won't do anything with the case until the FBI finishes its investigation into Fields, who was fired after the video became public. \"I do not simply decide cases based upon feelings, public opinion or sentiment, nor do I decide them based on political pressure,\" Johnson said in the statement. Disturbing schools is punishable by a fine of up to $1,000 or 90 days in jail. The students' lawyer did not respond to telephone messages. The video spread quickly across the country, prompting questions about when police officers should get involved with classroom discipline. Fields was called to the classroom after the student refused to stop using her cellphone, and then she would not leave the classroom for a teacher or administrator. In the days after the incident, the teacher turned her class over to a substitute and the administrator was placed on leave. Richland two officials didn't respond to an email asking about their current status. The students were allowed back in school. Organizers of the protest said they plan to be at South Carolina's Statehouse next year, calling for legislators to change the law that allows police officers to arrest students for misbehaving at schools. Richland County Sheriff Leon Lott blamed that law for escalating the situation. \"Let's find a way where we don't saddle students with arrest records,\" said EfiaNwangaza from the Malcom X Center for Self Determination. \"Let's get ahead of the schoolhouse-to-jailhouse train in South Carolina.\" What are the teens charged with?", "subject": ""}

As a recent article in The Guardian newspaper noted,  \"There's more to understanding a joke in a foreign language than understanding vocabulary and grammar.\" Being able to understand local jokes is often seen as an incredible ice-breaker for a language learner eager to form friendships with native speakers. \"I always felt that humor was a ceiling   that I could never break through,\" Hannah Ashley, a public relations account manager in London, who once studied Spanish in Madrid. Told The Guardian, \"I could never speak to people on the same level as I would speak to a native English speaker. I almost came across as quite a boring person because all I could talk about was facts.\" In fact, most of the time, jokes are only funny for people who share a cultural background or understand humor in the same way. Chinese-American comedian Joe Wong found this out first-hand. He had achieved huge success in the US, but when he returned to China in 2008 for his first live show in Beijing, he discovered that people didn't think his. Chinese jokes were as funny as his English ones. In Australia, meanwhile many foreigners find understanding jokes about sports to be the biggest headache. \"The hardest jokes are related to rugby because I know nothing about rugby,\" said Melody Cao, who was once a student in Australia. \"When I heard jokes I didn't get, I just laughed along.\" In the other two major English-speaking countries, the sense of humor is also different. British comedian Simon Pegg believes that while Britons use irony-basically, saying something they don't mean to make a joke-every day, people in the US don't see the point of using it so often. \"British jokes tend to be more subtle and dark, while American jokes are more obvious with their meanings, a bit like Americans themselves,\" he wrote in The Guardian.
