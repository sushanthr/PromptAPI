Within a month doctors told him that he had color1ectal cancer. After stock market hours on November 22nd, the fast-food firm said he had resigned; it would need a third boss in under a year. Yet when the market opened, its share price barely dipped then edged higher. After all, McDonald's had, again, shown how to act swiftly and decisively in appointing a new boss.  Mr. Bell himself got the top job when Jim Cantalupo died of a heart attack hours before he was due to address a convention of McDonald's franchisees . Mr. Cantalupo was a McDonald's veteran brought out of retirement in January 2003 to help remodel the firm after sales began falling because of dirty restaurants, indifferent service and growing concern about junk food. He devised a recovery plan, backed by massive marketing, and promoted Mr. Bell to chief operating officer. When Mr. Cantalupo died, a rapidly convened  board confirmed Mr. Bell, a 44-year-old Australian already widely seen as his heir apparent, in the top job. The convention got its promised chief executive's address, from the firm's first non-American leader. Yet within weeks executives had to think about what to do if Mr. Bell became too ill to continue. Perhaps Mr. Bell had the same thing on his mind: he usually introduced Jim Skinner, the 60-year-old vice-chairman, to visitors as the \"steady hand at the wheel\". Now Mr. Skinner, an expert on the firm's overseas operations, becomes chief executive, and Mike Roberts, head of its American operations, joins the board as chief operating officer. Is Mr. Roberts now the new heir apparent? Maybe. McDonald's has brought in supposedly healthier choices such as salads and toasted sandwiches worldwide and, instead of relying for most of its growth on opening new restaurants, has turned to upgrading its 31,000 existing ones. America has done best at this; under Mr. Roberts, like-for-like sales there were up by 7. 5% in October on a year earlier. The new team's task is to keep the revitalization plan on course, especially overseas, where some American brands are said to face political hostility from consumers. This is a big challenge. Is an in-house succession(, ) the best way to tackle it? Mr. Skinner and Mr. Roberts are both company veterans, having joined in the 1970s. Some recent academic studies find that the planned succession of a new boss from within, such as Mr. Bell and now (arguably) Mr. Roberts, produces better results than looking hastily, or outside, for one.

Small amounts of vitamin D are found in beef liver, cheese and egg yolks. But most of the vitamin D in the American diet comes from foods such as milk.

A straight line running from the southernmost coastal city to the northernmost coastal city would measure about 225 miles. If you followed the  coastline between these points, you would travel more than ten times as far. This irregularity is the result of what is called a drowned coastline. The term comes from the glacial activity of the Ice Age. At that time, the whole area that is now Maine was part of a mountain range that towered above the sea. As the glacier descended, however, it applied enormous force on those mountains, and they sank into the sea.      As the mountains sank, ocean water charged over the lowest parts of the remaining land. And the highest parts of the former mountain range, nearest the shore, remained as islands. Marine fossils  found here are 225 feet above sea level indicating the level of the shoreline prior to the glacier.      The 2,500-mile-long rocky and jagged  coastline of Maine keeps watch over nearly 2,000 islands. Many of these islands are tiny and uninhabited, but many are home to blooming communities. Mt. Desert Island is one of the largest, most beautiful of the Maine coast islands left behind by the glacier. Measuring 16 miles by 12 miles, Mt. Desert was very nearly formed as two distinct islands.

If they are close to confessing a crime, the blue on the wall might tip the balance.     Gwent Police have abandoned colours such as greys and browns of the 20th-century police cell  and have used colour psychology to decorate them.      Ystrad Mynach station, which recently opened at a cost ofPS5 million, has four cells with glass doors for prisoners who suffer from claustrophobia . Designers have painted the frames yellow, which researchers say is a calming colour. Other cells contain a royal blue line because psychologists believe that the colour is likely to encourage truthfulness.      The station has 31 cells, including 12 with a \"live scan\" system for drunken or disturbed prisoners, which detects the rise and fall of their chest. An alarm alerts officers if a prisoner's breathing stops and carries on ringing until the door is opened.     Designers and psychologists have worked for years on colour. Blue is said to suggest trust, efficiency, duty, logic, coolness, thinking and calm. It also suggests coldness and unfriendliness. It is thought that strong blues will stimulate clear thought and lighter, soft colours will calm the mind and aid concentration.     Yellow is linked with confidence, self-respect and friendliness. Get the colour wrong and it could cause fear, depression and anxiety, but the right yellow can lift spirits and self-respect.     Ingrid Collins, a psychologist who specializes in the effects of colour, said that colour was an \"energy force\". She said: \"Blue does enhance communication but I am not sure it would enhance truthful communication.\"     Yellow, she said, affected the mind. Red, on the other hand, should never be considered because it could increase aggression. Mrs Collins praised the designers for using colours in the cells. Gwent is not the first British force to experiment with colour to calm down or persuade prisoners to co-operate.

Storms in the mountains can produce sudden flooding on the floor of the Valley. The air temperature during the summer has been as high as 57degC. The sun can heat the ground so that the temperature of the rocks and soil can be as high as 74degC. The extreme heat of Death Valley has killed people in the past. It will continue to kill those who do not honor this extreme climate. Death Valley does not forgive those who are not careful. Death Valley is a good example of the violence of nature. It contains evidence of several ancient volcanoes that caused huge explosions. Evidence of one of these explosions is called Ubehebe Crater. The explosion left a huge hole in the ground almost a kilometer and a half wide. In many areas of Death Valley it is easy to see where the ground has been pushed up violently by movement deep in the Earth. This movement has created unusual and beautiful rock formations.

{"answer": 3, "choices": ["65%", "50%", "33%", "25%"], "question": "Many people believe that the only way to make our communities safer is to build more prisons. But there's a way better protect cities and towns by doing just the opposite. In many countries throughout the world, prison populations have risen dramatically over the past decade. One of the main reasons for this is the large number of repeat offenders; that is people who break the law again once freed from jail. Statistics show that about one in four prisoners freed every year return to jail within three years. This is partly because ex-prisoners face huge difficulty finding employment. More than a third of them cannot find any job at all. Data show that having a job greatly reduces the chances that a person will commit a crime again or commit one in the first place. Released prisoners who do manage to find steady employment are 50 percent less likely to return to prison. Rather than harming a community, having a job helps ex-prisoners to change their ways and make a positive and productive contribution to their communities. What's more, helping these men and women find jobs would also save taxpayers a lot of money. Few prisoners would save governments millions or possibly even billions of dollars annually: the costs of building and operating jails. There are many things that the government can do to help ex-prisoners find work. More job training programs should be introduced to provide prisoners with work skills before they are freed. Companies and factories should also be given tax benefits if they employ ex-prisoners. Such programs have been shown to work in several countries. Such policies of course assure that freed criminals actually want to work. But shouldn't they be given the chance? Our goal, after all, shouldn't be to incarcerate as many prisoners as possible, but to build a society that doesn't need to put such a large percentage of its population in jail.

My degree, with honors, in English literature had not really prepared me for anything practical. I knew I wanted to make a difference in the world somehow, but I had no idea how to do that. That's when I learned about the Lighthouse Project. I started my journey as a Lighthouse Project volunteer by reading as much as I could about the experiences of previous volunteers. I knew it would be a lot of hard work, and that I would be away from my family and friends for a very long time. In short, I did not take my decision to apply for the Lighthouse Project lightly. Neither did my family. Eventually, however, I won the support of my family, and I sent in all the paperwork needed for the application. After countless interviews and presentations, I managed to stand out among the candidates and survive the test alone. Several months later, I finally received a call asking me to report for the duty. I would be going to a small village near Abuja, Nigeria. Where? What? Nigeria? I had no idea. But I was about to find out. After completing my training, I was sent to the village that was small and desperately in need of proper accommodation. Though the local villagers were poor, they offered their homes, hearts, and food as if I were their own family. I was asked to lead a small team of local people in building a new schoolhouse. For the next year or so, I taught in that same schoolhouse. But I sometimes think I learned more from my students than they did from me. Sometime during that period, I realized that all those things that had seemed so strange or unusual to me no longer did, though I did not get anywhere with the local language, and returned to the United States a different man.

The program was founded by former President Dwight D. Eisenhower to promote peace through understanding. I had to put in many hours of special work to get to this point. First, a teacher nominated   me, and then I attended an informational meeting about the program. The application process included an interview, and finally, I was accepted. That's when the hard work really began. In addition to attending monthly meetings to prepare for the big trip, my parents encouraged my twin sister Beth (also participating in the program) and me to raise $ 2,000 each to help pay for the cost. And so the fund-raising began. We did everything from selling candy bars to selling an old car to decorating people's mailboxes during the holiday season. We also babysat, washed cars, held a yard sale, and washed windows. After months of hard work I had raised a total of $2319.87! Combined, Beth and I raised over $ 4500.00! Now I have a problem-packing. Yes, I know it sounds unimportant, but my suitcase seems to have shrunk   as I placed my belongings inside. According to airline regulations  , a suitcase can be no larger than 54 inches and weigh no more than 44 pounds. For a person who likes to wear a different outfit every day, packing all my clothes into such a small space seemed an impossible task. However, I have lessened my load and my suitcase which started out weighting overweight now checks in at a mere 36. Apart from a slightly bloated   carry-on bag, my luggage is definitely manageable.

It is a particular problem in richer countries with sleep experts linking it to the use of mobile phones and computers in bedroom late at night. Sleep deprivation is such a serious problem that lessons have to be dragged down to a lower level to suit sleep-deprived learners, the study found. The international comparison, carried out by Boston College, found the United States to have the highest number of sleep-deprived students, with 73% of 9- and 10-year-olds and 80% of 13- and 14-year-olds identified by their teachers as being negatively affected. In literacy  tests there were 76% of 9- and 10-year-olds lacking sleep. This was much higher than the international average of 47% of primary pupils needing more sleep and 57% among the secondary age group. Other countries with the most sleep-deprived youngsters were New Zealand, Saudi Arabia, Australia, England, Ireland and France. High-performing Finland is also among the most lacking in sleep.

Yet we are happy to see global efforts to protect the declining number of sharks. The world has realized that we need the species, like sharks, to keep a balanced ecosystem. Sharks, in particular, are \"in\" these days. Thanks to good public policy and famous stars such as Jackie Chan and Ang Lee, killing sharks for fin soup is no longer cool. The demand for shark fins has been rising for decades, threatening sharks with extinction -- up to 100 million sharks are killed each year just for their fins. But we have started to _ the trend, particularly in many areas of the United States and overseas where restaurants once proudly provided delicious shark fins on the menu. In California, a ban on the sale and possession of shark fin soup has gone into effect this year through the efforts of Wild Aid and other organizations. Overseas marketing and public efforts featuring posters on public transportation systems and TV ads have been underway for the past few years. These efforts all show signs of success, on both the supply side and the demand side of trade in shark fins. Actually, stopping the killing of sharks is part of a broader movement to stop the killing of wild animals and the buying and selling of wildlife products. These products come from hunting elephants, tigers and rhinos, besides killing marine life. Whether it is shark fin soup or ivory piano keys, killing animals is big business. The hunting of elephants in search of ivory tusks for luxury goods has become a full-scale war. The decrease of African elephant populations is alarming.

Yet we are happy to see global efforts to protect the declining number of sharks. The world has realized that we need the species, like sharks, to keep a balanced ecosystem. Sharks, in particular, are \"in\" these days. Thanks to good public policy and famous stars such as Jackie Chan and Ang Lee, killing sharks for fin soup is no longer cool. The demand for shark fins has been rising for decades, threatening sharks with extinction -- up to 100 million sharks are killed each year just for their fins. But we have started to _ the trend, particularly in many areas of the United States and overseas where restaurants once proudly provided delicious shark fins on the menu. In California, a ban on the sale and possession of shark fin soup has gone into effect this year through the efforts of Wild Aid and other organizations. Overseas marketing and public efforts featuring posters on public transportation systems and TV ads have been underway for the past few years. These efforts all show signs of success, on both the supply side and the demand side of trade in shark fins. Actually, stopping the killing of sharks is part of a broader movement to stop the killing of wild animals and the buying and selling of wildlife products. These products come from hunting elephants, tigers and rhinos, besides killing marine life. Whether it is shark fin soup or ivory piano keys, killing animals is big business. The hunting of elephants in search of ivory tusks for luxury goods has become a full-scale war. The decrease of African elephant populations is alarming. Together with international partners, the United States is leading the worldwide effort to reduce demand for high-end products that rely on killing animals.

As we were leaving, we found that only minutes earlier an elderly woman had fallen over at the entrance and had hit her head on the concrete. Her husband was with her, but there was blood everywhere and the woman was embarrassed and clearly in shock. Walking towards the scene, Tenyson became very upset about what had happened to the couple. He said to me, \"Mum, it's not much fun falling over in front of everyone.\" At the front of the supermarket a charity  group had set up a stand selling cooked sausages and flowers to raise funds. Tenyson suggested that we should buy the lady a flower. \"It will make her feel better,\" he said. I was amazed that he'd come up with such a sweet idea. So we went over to the flower seller and asked her if we could buy a flower for the lady to cheer her up. \"Just take it,\" she replied. \"I can't take your money for such a wonderful gesture.\" By now paramedics had arrived, and were attending the injured woman. As we walked up to her, my son became _ by all the blood and medical equipment. He said he was just too scared to go up to her. ZXXK Instead I gave the flower to the woman's husband and told him, \" My son was very upset for your wife and wanted to give her this flower to make her feel better.\" At that, the old man started crying and said, \"Thank you so much, you have a wonderful son.

But it's not printed on paper. Everyone who has a television can receive it because it is on TV. In order to read this magazine you have to have a _ . Each page of it is numbered, so you only have to dial the number to choose which subject you want to read about. There's a wide choice--- everything is included from cooking to the latest sports news. If you want to read the news, the first thing you have to do is to turn to the index page which has an easy-to-remember page number, 100 for example. Then you start choosing what you want to read. The news is on pages 101 to 109, so you push out the numbers and the news appears written across your screen. Perhaps you want to go out in the afternoon, so you press 181, and a brightly colored weather map appears on the screen. But the weather is terrible so you decide to go shopping and dial 162 for a list of the week's best bargains. But should you drive or take the train ? To answer the question you only have to press 189 for the traffic report. It's very simple to use. But probably the best thing about the service is that it's being updated all the time.

But the familiar story has a new chapter.Beginning in the 1980s,some consumers learned that cacao farmers were living difficult and uncertain lives.The farmers received money for their crops based on world markets,and the market price for cacao was sometimes so low that farmers received less for their crops than the crops had cost to produce.In response,groups of consumers in Europe and the United States developed\"fair trade\"organizations to guarantee that farmers of cacao,as well as coffee and tea,would receive fair and consistent prices for their crops. Fair trade organizations benefit farmers by buying cacao beans or other products from them directly at higher-than-market prices and eliminating  \"middle men\"such as exporters.Fair trade organizations also encourage farming techniques that are not harmful to the environment or to farm workers,for example,growing cacao without chemical pesticides or fertilizers in the shade of rain forest trees.One organization,Equal Exchange,helps farmers set up farming cooperatives in which they can share resources and work on projects such as community schools.Another,Fairtrade Labelling Organizations International (FLO),guarantees that products bearing its label meet standards that improve the lives of growers and producers.

His mother was ashamed. \"I don't know what to do with him these days,\" she said. \"He's forgotten all the manners we taught him.\" He hasn't forgotten them. He's just decided that he's not going to use them. She confessed   that she would like to come up behind him and throw him down from the sofa onto the floor. Another good friend of mine let her two daughters climb all over the furniture, reach across the table, stare at me and say, \"I don't like your dress; it's ugly.\" One of the daughters has recently been driven out of school. The other has left home. \"Where did we go wrong?\" her parents are now very sad. Probably nowhere much. At least, no more than the rest of that unfortunate race, parents. What is the author's opinion about the sudden change in teenage children?", "subject": ""}

There are some people who can calculate the day of the week for any given date in 40,000 years, but who cannot add two plus two. Others can perform complex classical piano pieces after hearing them once, but they cannot read or write. Dr. J. Langdon Down first described this condition in 1887. He called these people idiot savants. An idiot savant is a person who has significant mental injury, such as in autism   or retardation. At the same time, the person also exhibits some extraordinary skills, which are unusual for most people. The skills of the savant may vary from being exceptionally gifted in music or in mathematics, or having a photographic memory. One of the first descriptions of a human who could calculate quickly was written in 1789 by Dr. Benjamin Rush, an American doctor. His patient, Thomas Fuller, was brought to Virginia as a slave in 1724. It took Thomas only 90 seconds to work out that a man who has lived 70 years, 17 days, and 12 hours has lived 2,210,500,800 seconds. Despite this ability, he died in 1790 without ever learning to read or write. Another idiot savant slave became famous as a pianist in the 1860s. Blind Tom had a vocabulary of only 100 words, but he played 5,000 musical pieces beautifully. In the excellent movie Rain Man, made in 1988 and available on video cassette, Dustin Hoffman plays an idiot savant who amazes his brother played by Tom Cruise, with his ability to perform complex calculations very rapidly. Today we more clearly recognize that the idiot savant is special because of brain impairment. Yet not all brain injury leads to savant skills. Some studies have shown that people who have purposeful interruption of the left side of the brain can develop idiot savant skills. However few people wish to participate in such experiments. There are many excellent reasons for not undergoing unnecessary experimentation on one's brain. The term idiot savant is outdated and inappropriate. Virtually all savants have a high degree of intelligence and are thus not idiots. What does the passage mainly talk about?", "subject": ""}

The most deadly disaster happened on August 8 when a big landslide hit Zhouqu County in Gansu province, killing at least 1,407 people. On August 18, landslides hit Gongshan, a town in northwestern Yunnan. At least 38 people were killed and 54 are missing. Heavy rains also caused landslides in several counties in Sichuan province. People were forced to evacuate  to safe places. Landslides and devastation Landslides take place when dirt and rocks slide down a slope together. Sometimes these landslides are small, and hardly noticeable. Other times however, they can be massive, involving the entire side of a mountain. Landslides can be caused by a number of different things. Often rain, which adds weight to the side of a slope, can cause one. Other times they might be caused by erosion .When a stream slowly removes the base of a slope, it weakens the entire side of the mountain. As a slide moves down a mountain slope, it can pick up great speed and energy. Some slides travel at a speed of 300km an hour. The resulting winds can be so powerful that they are known to strip  the leaves off surrounding trees. Earthquakes and landslides Some experts think the landslides in Sichuan were related to the magnitude-8.0 Wenchuan earthquake on May 12, 2008. The quake has caused a change in the structure of the Earth's surface, making it more likely that land will slide in the rain, according to geologist Xu Qiang of the Chengdu University of Technology. Landslides pose  threats to 140 cities and towns in the country, one quarter of which are in Sichuan, said Wei Fangqiang, a researcher with the Chinese Academy of Sciences. Landslide prevention If you want to avoid being a landslide victim, the easiest thing to do is avoid living on slopes or close to mountains. If you live in a landslide-threatened area, try not to water the slopes if possible. If there are large rocks on the slopes above your house, remove them so that they don't cause damage if they fall.

A person can choose to love.\" To myself, I had to admit that I had been a selfish husband. Well, for two weeks that would change. And it did. Right from the moment I kissed Evelyn at the door and said, \"That new yellow sweater looks great on you.\" \"Oh, Tom, you noticed,\" she said, surprised and pleased. Maybe a little puzzled. After the long drive, I wanted to sit and read. Evelyn suggested a walk on the beach.

The behaviors can signal a serious problem: *Shopping or spending money as a result of feeling angry, depressed, anxious, or lonely *Having arguments with others about one's shopping habits *Feeling lost without credit cards -- actually going into withdrawal without them *Buying items on credit, rather than with cash *Describing a rush or a feeling of euphoria with spending *Feeling guilty, ashamed, or embarrassed after a spending spree  *Thinking obsessively about money *Spending a lot time juggling accounts or bills to accommodate spending \"If someone identifies four or more of any of these behaviors, there may be a problem\", experts say. Treating a shopping addiction requires a multifaceted approach. There are no standard treatments for shopping addiction. Medications have been used, but with mixed results. Therapists also focus on cognitive-behavioral treatment programs. There is no quick and easy answer that will immediately cure a shopping addiction, and while treatment is a necessary part of solving the problem, so is behavior change on the part of the addict. Some basic changes in behavior that will have a big impact on breaking a shopping addiction are recommended: *Admit that you are a compulsive spender, which is half the battle. *Get rid of checkbooks and credit cards, which fuel the problem. *Don't shop by yourself because most compulsive shoppers shop alone and if you are with someone you are much less likely to append more. *Find other meaningful ways to spend time. And keep in mind that while behavior change is clearly important to recovery, so is reaching out for professional help.(509) The most important way to get rid of the addiction is    _   .", "subject": ""}

The parrot has learned to copy sounds that people make. Birds are not the only animals that can copy the noises they hear. Dolphins, bats, and some apes also copy sounds. Now we can add elephants to this list of copycats. Dr. Joyce Poole is a zoologist. She studies the sounds of elephants. While she was in Kenya, she would hear strange noises made by Mlaika after sunset. Mlaika was a 10-year-old African elephant. Mlaika lived near a highway. Dr. Poole says, \"I could not tell the difference between Mlaika's call and the distant truck noise.\" She and other scientists studied Mlaika's sounds. It turned out that Mlaika was copying the sounds of the trucks driving by. Why would Mlaika copy trucks that she heard going by on the highway? Animals that are able to copy sounds may enjoy practicing new sounds. When they are kept outside of their natural environment, they may copy unusual sounds. That may be why an elephant would copy the sound of a truck. \"Mlaika was not the only copycat elephant,\" Dr. Poole says. Calimero is a 23-year-old male African elephant. He spent 18 years with two female Asian elephants. Asian elephants make chirping sounds (sounds made by birds) to talk with one another. African elephants usually do not make chirping sounds. But Calimero now does. He is copying his Asian elephant friends. Dr. Poole says that elephants need to form bonds with their family and friends. She says, \"They make sounds to communicate with each other.

Send me $ 5 and I'll tell you my secret.' When I received the money I wrote back telling people to do as I do.\" Johnny was fined $250 by the court and was ordered to pay all the people back.

{"answer": 1, "choices": ["Fish having very bad memories.", "Fish being smarter than we thought.", "How fish improve their memory.", "What we can learn from fish."], "question": "It's a popular belief that a fish's memory lasts for only seven seconds. It may seem sad to think that they don't remember what they've eaten or where they've been, and they don't recognize you or any of their friends -- every moment in their life would be like seeing the world for the first time. But don't be so quick to feel sorry for them. A new study has found that fish have a much better memory than we used to think. In fact, certain species of fish can even remember events from as long as 12 days ago. In the study, researchers from MacEwan University in Canada trained a kind of fish called African cichlids to go to a certain area of their tank to get food. They then waited for 12 days before putting them back in the tank again. Researchers used computer software to monitor the fish's movements. They found that after such a long break the fish still went to the same place where they first got food. This suggested that they could remember their past experiences. In fact, scientists had been thinking for a long time that African cichlids might have a good memory. An earlier study showed that they behaved aggressively  in front of certain fish, perhaps because they remembered their past \"fights\". But until the latest findings, there was no clear evidence. Just as a good memory can make our lives easier, it also plays an important part when a fish is trying to survive in the wild. \"If fish are able to remember that a certain area contains safe food, they will be able to go back to that area without putting their lives at risks,\" lead researcher Trevor Hamilton toldLive Science.

Aragon and her fellow psychologists looked at hundreds of participants' emotional responses to different things, including happy reunions and cute babies. Many participants said they would react in a negative or aggressive way to the positive things -- to cry at happy moments and want to pinch a cute baby's face or even tell them \"I want to eat you up!\" But then researchers found that these people were able to calm down from strong emotions more quickly. \"We want a happy, middle spot.

The villa's walls will include special particles that turn into a liquid when squeezed   under pressure, flow into cracks, and then harden to form a solid material. The NanoManufacturing Institute (NMI), based in Leeds University, will play a key role in an EU project to construct the home by December 2010. The project, called \"Intelligent Safe and Secure Buildings\" (ISSB) is funded under the EU's Sixth Framework program. This potentially life-saving scheme is led by German building manufacturer Knauf. The villa will be built in Amphilochia, in western Greece, where Knauf currently runs a manufacturing plant. If the experiment is successful, more tremor-resistant homes could be built in earthquake zones across the globe. NMI chief executive Professor Terry Wilkins said, \"What we're trying to achieve here is very exciting. We're looking to use polymers in much tougher situations than ever before on a larger scale.\" Monitors contained in the villa's walls will be able to collect vast amounts of data about the building over time. Wireless sensors  will record any stresses and vibrations, as well as temperature, humidity and gas levels. The walls are to be built from new load-bearing steel frames and high-strength gypsum board. Prof Wilkins said, \"If there are any problems, the intelligent sensor network will be able to alert residents immediately so they have time to escape. If whole groups of houses are so constructed, we could use a larger network of sensors to get even more information.

{"answer": 1, "choices": ["Crazy and tough", "Firm and stubborn", "Enthusiastic and generous", "Abnormal and aggressive."], "question": "Amy returned to her small apartment at midnight, tired. Her worst fears raced through her mind. Would the court tell her she couldn't care for her family anymore? Would the kids go through the sadness once more of being split up and sent away? She was so young, almost a child herself, and yet Amy knew everything depended on her. At that moment, she wondered if she would ever find the strength to see it through. From earliest childhood, Amy took care of her younger brothers. Jan, their mother, only added to the family disorder and confusion because of her drug addict. Sometimes they lived in apartments, sometimes in shelters. One afternoon Amy was called to the high school, where a social worker was waiting for her. \"We're going to have to put you guys in foster  care.\" the social worker said. \"No! Don't spilt us up!\" the girl cried out. \"Can't you just leave it the way it is?\" The social worker shook his head. Amy's voice then rose like the howl of a lion protecting her babies: \"Why can't I take them? I take care of them all the time anyway.\" The social worker hesitated, and then said, \"Maybe. Once you're 18, you could apply to become their relative caretaker. Then you'd be their foster mother until we find a home where all of you can be together.\" \"I'll do it,\" Amy said. One month later, Amy was named _ of her brothers for a six-month trial period. It was a remarkable victory for an 18-year-old girl. Her brothers didn't make her task any easier in the months ahead. However,Amy's efforts were rewarded when the court allowed her to continue as guardian. Amy's relief at remaining the kids' guardian was at risk of being taken away by the pressure she always felt to measure up. Social workers still looked regularly over her shoulder and asked the boys shameful questions: \"Does she feed you? Does she ever try to harm you?\" Then one day a visiting social worker came over. \"We'd like to get the boys adopted into homes,\" she said. Sensing that the family was about to be split apart yet again, Amy replied, \"Fine, then. Call it adoption if you want, but they're not going anywhere.\" To her surprise, the social worker took her remark seriously. She explained that if Amy were to adopt the boys, they would become like any other family. That night at dinner Amy told the boys about the idea. \"Cool!\" Joey said. He threw a piece of corn at Adam. His brother flicked it back, and pretty soon corn was flying. Amy rolled her eyes. _ As the proceedings ended, Amy thanked everyone. \"No,\" the judge responded, \"Thank you. You saved three kids. Not many family members would do what you're doing, especially for this many children. I'm very proud of you.\" On a lazy spring day, in a modest suburban neighborhood, Amy stood in front of a neatly kept one-story house.

From earliest childhood, Amy took care of her younger brothers. Jan, their mother, only added to the family disorder and confusion because of her drug addict. Sometimes they lived in apartments, sometimes in shelters. One afternoon Amy was called to the high school, where a social worker was waiting for her. \"We're going to have to put you guys in foster  care.\" the social worker said. \"No!

She explained that if Amy were to adopt the boys, they would become like any other family. That night at dinner Amy told the boys about the idea. \"Cool!\" Joey said.

That is why I am sending you this printed reply to your letter. I'll try to answer some of the questions that are commonly asked. Where did I get the idea for Stuart Little and for Charlotte's Web? Well, many years ago I went to bed one night in a railway sleeping car, and during the night I dreamed about a tiny boy who acted rather like a mouse. That's how the story of Stuart Little got started. As for Charlotte's Web, I like animals and my barn is a very pleasant place to be, at all hours. One day when I was on my way to feed the pig, I began feeling sorry for the pig because, like most pigs, he was doomed to die. This made me sad. So I started thinking of ways to save a pig's life. I had been watching a big grey spider at her work and was impressed by how clever she was at weaving. Gradually I worked the spider into the story that you know, a story of friendship and salvation on a farm. Three years after I started writing it, it was published. (I am not a fast worker, as you can see.) Sometimes I'm asked how old I was when I started to write, and what made me want to write. I started early--as soon as I could spell. In fact, I can't remember any time in my life when I wasn't busy writing. I don't know what caused me to do it, or why I enjoyed it, but I think children often find pleasure and satisfaction in trying to set their thoughts down on paper, either in words or in pictures. I was no good at drawing, so I used words instead. As I grew older, I found that writing can be a way of earning a living. Some of my readers want me to visit their school. Some want me to send a picture, or an autograph, or a book. And some ask questions about my family and my animals and my pets. Much as I'd like to, I can't go visiting. I can't send books, either--you can find them in a bookstore or a library. Many children assume that a writer owns (or even makes) his own books. This is not true--books are made by the publisher.

It is the tradition of this school to promote education and to be the pioneer of new technology. That is why I strongly argue in favor of the addition of more computers to the computer lab. Although expanding the campus bookstore to include CDs, gifts, and a snack bar will give a nicer look to the college, we have to think about a greater goal and a more practical way to enhance the quality of life for students. What do we .want for our students and our college? Do we want our college to be known as a place with a great bookstore where you can find CDs and gifts, or as a place where the students can explore and research in their field using the best tools provided by technology? In addition, there are already several snack bars on campus, and there are music stores nearby, so students do not depend on the college bookstore for these things. We live in a highly technological world and computers play an increasingly important role in how we live. As a learning institution, this college has the responsibility to offer its students the best technology to help them prepare for their future. Many students will be expected to be familiar with the latest software and other tools when they go on to work or to graduate school. While they are in college, students find they are expected to use computers. Many professors expect students to use computers to do homework or to complete projects. Since students are competing for good grades, those who have limited access to computers are at a great disadvantage. Furthermore, being able to do projects using the computer enhances the process of learning. If there are more computers, no more will students have to wait in line while scanning the room for an empty chair and computer.. No longer will they have to sit and wait while an outdated computer struggles to follow their commands. Having more new and faster computers available will enable students to finish their work more quickly. The more computers are used in society, the more colleges will depend on them as a tool of teaching and learning. Making computers more available to students facilitates their learning process by making the process easier, more interesting, more engaging, and in the process enhancing their quality of life.

But is traffic jam a sign of failure? Long queues at restaurants or theater box offices are seen as signs of success. Should transportation systems be viewed any differently? I think we should recognize that traffic jam is an unpreventable by-product of successful cities, and view the \"traffic problem\" in a different light.

First, some people admire and imitate stars because they allow themselves to be influenced by the media. Television, radio, and magazines invade  the lives of audience with a variety of shows, information, and publications about stars and their lives. For instance, Britney Spears has become the target of paparazzi . In May, Britney appeared at the front page of the most popular magazines revealing that she married her best friend in Vegas, Nevada. Media also invade stars' lives because reporters know they can get high profits from readers who buy and follow their favorite artists' news. Second, some mad audiences imitate their celebrities for their lack of confidence. Some people who are shy and lack personality may find that imitating others will cause a good impression. For example, my cousin Jenny, who lacks a social life because of her introverted  personality, believes that acting and dressing like Jennifer Lopez will make her popular in high school. Finally, several fans of stars imitate them because of peer pressure. Since my niece's girl friends formed an Antonio Banderas' fan club, she had also joined the group. Although she wasn't a huge fan of his, now she collects most of Banderas' possessions. In fact, when I asked Arianna, my niece, why she was part of Banderas' fan club, she replied with a doubtful tone that she did not wish to be rejected by the other teens. In conclusion, it is true that celebrities play spectacular roles in their performances in Hollywood, which entertains many people all over the world; however, modern celebrities influence the audience to the point where their fans admire and try to imitate their lives.

Television, radio, and magazines invade  the lives of audience with a variety of shows, information, and publications about stars and their lives. For instance, Britney Spears has become the target of paparazzi . In May, Britney appeared at the front page of the most popular magazines revealing that she married her best friend in Vegas, Nevada. Media also invade stars' lives because reporters know they can get high profits from readers who buy and follow their favorite artists' news. Second, some mad audiences imitate their celebrities for their lack of confidence. Some people who are shy and lack personality may find that imitating others will cause a good impression. For example, my cousin Jenny, who lacks a social life because of her introverted  personality, believes that acting and dressing like Jennifer Lopez will make her popular in high school. Finally, several fans of stars imitate them because of peer pressure. Since my niece's girl friends formed an Antonio Banderas' fan club, she had also joined the group. Although she wasn't a huge fan of his, now she collects most of Banderas' possessions. In fact, when I asked Arianna, my niece, why she was part of Banderas' fan club, she replied with a doubtful tone that she did not wish to be rejected by the other teens. In conclusion, it is true that celebrities play spectacular roles in their performances in Hollywood, which entertains many people all over the world; however, modern celebrities influence the audience to the point where their fans admire and try to imitate their lives.

There are too many unknown words and as a result reading is simply not a pleasure. For some students, even reading in their own language is a chore. Having a wide vocabulary is essential to making sense of written language. Of course, this is a circular argument, because the more you read the more vocabulary you learn and the more words you know the more easily you can read. Don't make the mistake of reading with your dictionary beside you, looking up every single new or doubtful word. This is laborious and prevents you from practicing the skill of prediction. Sometimes in reading you find a word you know but the sense doesn't seem to fit in. This is not surprising because words have so many meanings and degrees of meaning. What is more, part of their meaning is shaped by the words around them. Keep looking at the surrounding words and asking yourself \"what sort of meaning would make sense here?\" The more that people study the reading process, the better they can pass on to language learners a range of advice to choose from. People have learned to read in all kinds of ways. Here is some information that could help you plan to be a better reader in the foreign language you are studying. 1)Work out the general meaning first When people read in a new language they often feel they must take a detailed approach, focusing on every word, particularly those they don't know. They read as if they were using a microscope, looking carefully at each of the small pieces(the individual words), but not necessarily seeing the whole picture at first. This is called the \"bottom-up\" approach. Other readers try to look first at the big picture(the \"top-down\" approach), attending to individual bricks only as necessary, a process that involves some intelligent guesswork. Generally this second approach is recommended by successful learners. 2)Interactive reading Another way of thinking about reading is to describe it as an interactive process, where the text brings something to you and you bring something to the text. Readers bring together all their knowledge of the world with what they see on the page in front of them. That is why, when reading in our own language, we don't need to read every word. We add meaning which is not actually stated. 3)From supported reading to independent reading Language learners start by needing considerable support as they read.

Garcia Marquez says that his grandmother's way of storytelling later influenced his own methods. When Garcia Marquez was about 20 years old, he left Aractataca and attended university in Bogota.

For many years, Garcia Marquez knew he wanted to write about his grandfather's house in Aractataca. To write this book, Garcia Marquez and his wife had to sell almost all of their possessions to survive. But their act was worth it.

So Murrary had to find volunteers from Britain, the United States, and the British colonies to search every newspaper, magazine, and book ever written in English.

Over the next years, he became one of the staff's most valued contributors. But he was also a mystery. In spite of many invitations, he would always decline to visit Oxford. So in 1897, Murray finally decided to travel to Crowthorne himself. When he arrived, he found Minor locked in a book-lined cell at the Broadmoor Asylum for the Criminally insane.

He gave his address as \"Broadmoor, Crowthorne, Berkshire,\" 50 miles from Oxford. Minor joined the army of volunteers sending words and quotations to Murray. Over the next years, he became one of the staff's most valued contributors. But he was also a mystery. In spite of many invitations, he would always decline to visit Oxford. So in 1897, Murray finally decided to travel to Crowthorne himself. When he arrived, he found Minor locked in a book-lined cell at the Broadmoor Asylum for the Criminally insane. Murray and Minor became friends, sharing their love of words. Minor continued contributing to the dictionary, sending in more than 10,000 submissions in 20 years. Murray continued to visit Minor regularly, sometimes taking walks with him around the asylum grounds. In 1910, Minor left Broadmoor for an asylum in his native America. Murray was at the port to wave goodbye to his remarkable friend. Minor died in 1920, seven years before the first edition of the Oxford English Dictionary was completed.

The clues are planting the seeds of an Apple watch in consumers' minds. The general public has not been crying out for a better watch. And Apple prides itself on knowing what the people want before they do, and an Apple watch would be much more than just a fancy timepiece. It's not about the watch form factor, but creating a wearable mobile device that takes advantage of advances in mobile computing technology such as cheap sensors, better battery life and improved voice recognition. If executed correctly, an Apple watch could bring about a profitable industry of products to go with it, like it did with the iOS App Store and mobile applications. \"It's unlimited, the number of wearable things you can put into,\" said Gene Munster, an analyst with Piper Jaffray, who imagines small companies making inexpensive products like belts with sensors that send warnings to the watch when you've eaten too much. Apple is not entering virgin territory. There are already a handful of fancy smart watches available, but most act as accessories , connecting to the more powerful Android and iOS smartphones and tablets over Bluetooth. For example, the new Pebble smart watch passes on alerts from a smartphone, so when you receive a text, e-mail, or Facebook notification it is pushed to the watch, which vibrates . Wearable technology is also booming, thanks to cheap sensors that can be used to track things like movement and heart rates. The number of wearable fitness products has been growing at a fast pace, but an Apple offering would shake up the industry completely. \"We're finally getting some players involved, and Apple is the real one that can add some value to some of this wearable technology,\" said Munster. Apple isn't alone in seeing the potential for this type of technology. Google is working on its own wearable platform, Google Glasses. The two will compete against each other when they are finally available, each sporting its own unique opinion on what kind of user interface people will use (voice control and a small touchscreen or augmented reality). And they will, of course, have their own ecosystems of accessories and apps. Traditional watches have dropped in popularity in recent years. Smartphones display the easy-to-see time and are already in our back pockets, so it can seem unnecessary to also tie a small clock to our wrists. But when you start packing more power, sensors and connection options like Bluetooth into a watch, it no longer stays to be a watch and becomes a small wearable computer. An Apple watch could suddenly become better than the current crop of smart watches by creating a platform, not another accessory. According to Munster, the three tasks people use their smartphones for are, in order, texting, Internet and phone calls.

But even at the height of my admiration, I couldn't agree with him that Anne, the main character inAnne of Green Gables, was \"the dearest and most loveable child in fiction since the best-known Alice\". I had readAnne of Green Gables as well asTom Sawyer, and she had made me as sick as a dog. Another Mark Twain's quote will explain my problem.

But when I got to be 21, I was astonished at how much the old man had learned in seven years.\" I gradually understood his words as growing up. When I picked up the book again a few years later, I too was astonished at how much it had improved--and shortly afterwards shocked by the fact that not only could I be a fool in all sporting, artistic and practical matters, I could also be so when it came to reading too. On rereading, then, I learned that Anne is indeed a dear and most lovable child. I couldn't help adoring the girl who insists that her name be spelled with the \"e\" instead of Ann as she believes that is \"so much more distinguished.\" She is a brave and determined survivor of a severe upbringing who has refused to let her circumstances crush her spirit. She arrives at Marilla and Matthew Cuthbert's farm with everything unfavorable--orphaned, unwanted and her biggest trouble of red-hair and freckled   face. However, she gets along well, through her strange way of seeing things, through her honest love of beauty and lovable attempts to master her unreasonable desires. She finally wins over the Cuthberts, their neighbors and millions of readers who have met her over the 101 years since the book was first published.  When I settle down with it these days, I've come to see the truth in Mark Twain's praise for the book, and this reminds me of the great truth that you are never too young to start rereading.

{"answer": 1, "choices": ["younger people are replacing the elderly", "well-educated people tend to work longer", "unemployment rates are rising year after year", "people with no college degree do not easily find work"], "question": "Across the rich world, well-educated people increasingly work longer than the less-skilled. Some 65% of American men aged 62-74 with a professional degree are in the workforce, compared with 32% of men with only a high-school certificate. This gap is part of a deepening divide between the well-education well off and the unskilled poor. Rapid technological advance has raised the incomes of the highly skilled while squeezing those of the unskilled. The consequences, for individual and society, are profound. The world is facing as astonishing rise in the number of old people, and they will live longer than ever before. Over the next 20 years the global population of those aged 65 or more will almost double, from 600 million to 1.1 billion. The experience of the 20th century, when greater longevity translated into more years in retirement rather than more years at work, has persuaded many observers that this shift will lead to slower economic growth, while the swelling ranks of pensioners will create government budget problems. But the notion of a sharp division between the working young and the idle old misses a new trend, the growing gap between the skilled and the unskilled. Employment rates are falling among younger unskilled people, whereas older skilled folk are working longer. The divide is most extreme in America, where well-educated baby-boomers   are putting off retirement while many less-skilled younger people have dropped out of the workforce. That even the better-off must work longer to have a comfortable retirement. But the changing nature of work also plays a big role. Pay has risen sharply for the highly educated, and those people continue to reap rich rewards into old age because these days the educated elderly are more productive than the preceding generation.

During an experiment in Virginia in 1995, 100 eighth graders were separated just for math and science courses. Almost immediately, the girls began to achieve more, become more confident and take part more often in class activities. In 2001, a British study concluded that nearly every girl regardless of   her ability or socio-economic status performed better in single sex classrooms than co-ed ones. The study of 2,954 high schools and 979 primary schools showed that while boys at the lowest levels in study improved the most in single sex schools, single sex education was particularly beneficial   to girls. Every one of the top 50 private elementary schools and top 20 private high schools in Britain are single sex schools.

A quarter of the female members of the US Congress and one-third of all female members of Fortune 100 boards graduated from all-women's colleges.

HGB also has the idea that farmers who own their own land will raise crops with an eye to the long-term health of the soil. He would like to see that balanced with a foreign-aid plan.

It is during our teenage years that lifestyle habits can become entrenched  , so it is important that young people are educated about what foods are good for them.

Their dams are fine examples of engineering. A pair of beavers will build a dam, using branches, mud and stones, across a river. The water held back by the dam flows over the bank on either side of the river, flooding the nearby ground and forming a pond. At some point in the pond the beavers then build their home, which is called a lodge. This consists of a cone-shaped  pipe of branches and sticks of two to six feet in length held together with mud and stones, the top of which projects above the waterline. It serves as a shelter from the bad weather, a safety from enemies and a base for food supplies to be drawn upon in winter. From an engineering point of view the lodge could hardly be improved. Not only does it contain a central room just above water level, which is accessible only through underwater tunnels, but it also has \"walls\", one or more escape tunnels and an air hole at the top, which controls the temperature inside and gives air-conditioning. It is altogether a clever piece of construction, with all modern conveniences. It is, in fact, better protected against the effects of flooding than many human houses. Trees are essential to beavers. They eat the bark on the upper branches. But they must first _ the trees, using their four front teeth. With these sharp tools, it takes only a few minutes to cut down a tree. The engineering skill of beavers is to a large extent a result of their ability to use their front paws as hands. A female will carry her young held under her chin  with her front paws, walking on her hind legs. A similar method is used by all beavers when transporting stones or mud, although they also carry such materials on their broad flat trails. The fore-paws are also used for digging and for dragging heavier pieces of wood. This text is mainly about   _  .", "subject": ""}

The real solution  will have to be a new kind of car, one that does not use so much gas. The real solution to the gas shortage problem is   _", "subject": ""}

What is supposed to happen now is that lots of copycat firms rush in with \"generic\" (ie, chemically identical) versions of Lipitor at perhaps one-fifth of its price.Patients and health-care payers should reap the benefit.Pfizer's revenues should suffer. The same story will be repeated many times, as other best-selling drugs march over the patent cliff But generics makers may face delays getting their cheaper versions to market.Ranbaxy, a Japanese-owned drugmaker, struggled to get regulators' approval for its generic version of Lipitor, and only won it on the day the patent expired.More importantly, research-based drug firms are using a variety of tactics to make the patent cliff slope more gently. Jon Leibowitz, chairman of America's Federal Trade Commission (FTC), is concerned by drugmakers filing additional patents on their products to put off the day when their protection expires. Another tactic  is \"pay-for-delay\", in which a drugmaker facing a legal challenge to its patent pays its would-be competitor to put off introducing its cheaper copy. In the year to October the FTC identified what it believes to be 28 such settlements. American and European regulators are looking into these deals. However, legal challenges against them have been delayed, and a bill to ban them is stuck in Congress. To encourage generics makers to challenge patents on drugs, and introduce cheaper copies, an American law passed in 1984 says that the first one to do so will get a 180-day exclusivity period,in which no other generics maker can sell versions of the drug in question, as Ranbaxy supposedly won with Lipitor. However, Pfizer is exploiting a loophole  in the 1984 law, which lets it appoint a second, authorised copycat--in this case, Watson, another American firm.According to BernsteinResearch, under the deal between the two drugmakers Pfizer will receive about 70% of Watson's revenues from its approved copy of Lipitor.More unusual, Pfizer has cut the price of its original version, and will keep marketing it vigorously. So Ranbaxy faces not one, but two competitors. All this may raise Pfizer's sales by nearly $500m in the last half of 2015 compared with what they would otherwise have been, says Tim Anderson of BernsteinResearch, with revenues then falling after the 180 days are over.

Another tactic  is \"pay-for-delay\", in which a drugmaker facing a legal challenge to its patent pays its would-be competitor to put off introducing its cheaper copy. In the year to October the FTC identified what it believes to be 28 such settlements. American and European regulators are looking into these deals. However, legal challenges against them have been delayed, and a bill to ban them is stuck in Congress. To encourage generics makers to challenge patents on drugs, and introduce cheaper copies, an American law passed in 1984 says that the first one to do so will get a 180-day exclusivity period,in which no other generics maker can sell versions of the drug in question, as Ranbaxy supposedly won with Lipitor. However, Pfizer is exploiting a loophole  in the 1984 law, which lets it appoint a second, authorised copycat--in this case, Watson, another American firm.According to BernsteinResearch, under the deal between the two drugmakers Pfizer will receive about 70% of Watson's revenues from its approved copy of Lipitor.More unusual, Pfizer has cut the price of its original version, and will keep marketing it vigorously. So Ranbaxy faces not one, but two competitors. All this may raise Pfizer's sales by nearly $500m in the last half of 2015 compared with what they would otherwise have been, says Tim Anderson of BernsteinResearch, with revenues then falling after the 180 days are over. Others fear that Pfizer's tactics , if copied, will make the 180-day exclusivity period worth far less, and thus discourage generic firms from challenging patents in the first place.

We speak to pets with the same high-pitched voices that we use for babies.

A recent paper by George Regents University demonstrates this human involvement with pets to an astonishing extent.

With responses from more than 500 people, the answer was that it depended: What kind of human and what kind of dog?

Regrettably, however, the report's failure to address the true nature of the crisis facing liberal education may cause more harm than good. In 2010, leading congressional Democrats and Republicans sent letters to the AAAS asking that it identify actions that could be taken by federal states and local governments, universities, foundations, educators, individual benefactors  and others to maintain national excellence in humanities and social scientific scholarship and education. In response, the AAAS formed the Committee on the Humanities and Social Sciences. Among the Committee's 51 members are top-university presidents, scholars, lawyers, judges, and business executives, as well as distinguished figures from diplomacy, filmmaking, music and journalism. The goals identified in the report are generally admirable. Because the government supports full literacy   of citizens, the report stresses the study of history and government, particularly American history and American government; and encourages the use of new digital technologies. To encourage innovation and competition, the report calls for increased investment in research, the introduction of a series of curricula that improve students' ability to solve problems and communicate effectively in the 21st century, increased funding for teachers and the encouragement of scholars to bring their learning into practice on the great challenges of the day. The report also advocates greater study of foreign languages, international affairs and the expansion of study abroad programs.

The International Union for Conservation of Nature warns that rhinos may die out by 2026. People who hunt and kill illegally are called poachers. The most effective way to watch for and prevent illegal hunting is from the air. However, piloted flights are too costly. Fortunately, some Spanish college students have invented a drone   that can observe more places than a plane. Arnau Garcia is an aeronautical   engineering student at the Polytechnic Institute of Catalonia, in Spain. He says observers from the air have trouble finding poachers when they hide under the trees. Mr. Garcia and other students have worked with the drone manufacturer HEMAV to help find the hidden poachers. They make it by using the thermal camera, which is especially sensitive to body heat. Even when the poachers keep still, it can also keep track of them. The drone can fly in the wind up to 55 kilometers per hour. It has an autopilot system, so it memorizes the flight path. The drone also has a microphone, a video camera and a GPS system. These permit it to report accurately where a picture is taken. After each flight, the drone can bring back detailed information about where rhinos are found, the conditions of water and plants in the area, and the positions of suspected poachers. Experts say the drone can fly as far as 70 kilometers from the base. It means that it could quickly observe large areas for poachers. However, the same search operation would take days for human observers. Thanks to the drone, many poachers have been caught and the number of rhinos is on the increase.

I call them \"pest friends\".www.ks5u.com The second kind of friend is a \"guest friend\". They are just social partners. You meet them at a certain location and at the end of the meeting you go your separate way and they go theirs. You don't talk too often with this sort of friend, and you don't share each other's secrets. Lastly, we have \"best friends\". This sort of friend is there when you need them. They know you as a person and they are there through thick and thin. Best friends are the ones that you can lean and depend on no matter what happens. If you need a listening ear, they will be the one to lend support. Friends come in all different shapes and sizes. Every friend has an impact on our life.

{"answer": 1, "choices": ["Three", "Four", "Five", "Six"], "question": "The future of agriculture must achieve several goals at the same time.  First, it now appears that we will have to double world food production in the next 40 years due to population growth, increasing meat consumption and pressure from biofuels  . We will also have to reduce the environmental impacts from our farming practices, which have caused widespread damage to soils, ecosystems, waters and even the atmosphere. In fact, agriculture's impacts are as bad as climate change as an environmental concern. Besides, we will have to improve food security for the world's poor. While the Green Revolution of the 1960s made it possible to feed hundreds of millions more people than in earlier eras, the number of the under-nourished in the world has started to rise again. Finally, we will have to increase the recovering ability of agriculture from shocks. Today, our high-efficiency, globalized world has many benefits, but it is vulnerable   to destruction, whether from droughts, diseases or sudden price rises. We must start building better food systems to better keep us away from future shocks. Currently, there are two models of agriculture: local and organic agriculture vs. globalized and industrialized agriculture. Each has been strongly supported and severely criticized, but neither of these models, standing alone, can fully meet our needs. Organic agriculture teaches us important lessons about soils, nutrition and pest management. Unfortunately, organic food provides less than 1% of the world's calories, mostly to the wealthy. It is hard to imagine organic farming developing to feed 9 billion. Globalized and industrialized agriculture has benefits of high output and low labor demands. Without it, billions of people would have starved. However, it has come with enormous environmental and social costs, which cannot be sustained. Rather than voting for just one solution, we need a third way to solve the crisis. Let's take ideas from both sides, creating new, hybrid solutions that increase production, save resources and build a more sustainable agriculture. There are many promising avenues to pursue. A new \"third way\" for agriculture is not only possible but also necessary. Our problems are huge, and they will require everyone at the table, working together toward solutions.

For those who don't know, Paul Smith is an English designer brand. His shirts cost about 1,000 yuan and upwards. I paid 50 yuan for my colorful shirt from a street vendor in Beijing. Of course my shirt was a knockoff, a cheap copy of the brand. After a few washes, little balls formed on the surface of the thin material. Do I care? Not at all. You get what you pay for. I have to admit I hate shopping. _ I have other priorities. In You Are What You Wear, US writer Jennifer Baumgartner says people's clothes tell a story about their personality. She writes: \"The clothes you choose to wear provide important information about you as a person: your approximate education level, your income, social status and even your level of self-esteem  .\" When I started work as an undercover crime reporter, I had to shop for jeans and a hoodie   in order to fit in with a rough and ready   social group. I bought the hoodie in a charity shop. My daughters were shocked. They thought I looked bad, but I knew my disguise was perfect. Elizabeth L. Cline thinks she knows best when it comes to cheap clothes in her book Overdressed: The Shockingly High Cost of Cheap Fashion. She expresses sadness that clothing has been turned into a good that is thrown away after being used once or twice.

Kit Williams, a modern writer, had the idea of combining the real excitement of a treasure hunt with clues   found in a book when he wrote a children's story, Masquerade, in 1979. The book was about a hare, and a month before it came out,  Williams buried a gold hare in a park in Bedfordshire. The book contained a large number of clues to help readers find the hare, but Williams put in a lot of \"red herrings\", or false clues, to mislead _ . Ken Roberts, the man who found the hare, had been looking for it for nearly two years. Although he had been searching in the wrong area most of the time, he found it by logic, not by luck. His success came from the fact that he had gained an important clue at the start. He had realized that the words: \"One of Six to Eight\" under the first picture in the book connected the hare in some way to Katherine of Aragon, the first of Henry VIII's six wives. Even here, however, Williams had succeeded in misleading him. Ken knew that Katherine of Aragon had died at Kimbolton in Cambridgeshire in 1536 and thought that Williams had buried the hare there. He had been digging there for over a year before a new idea occurred to him. He found out that Kit Williams had spent his childhood near Ampthill, in Bedfordshire, and thought that he must have buried the hare in a place he knew well, but he still could not see the connection with Katherine of Aragon, until one day he came across two stone crosses in Ampthill Park and learnt that they had been built in her honor in 1773. Even then his search had not come to an end. It was only after he had spent several nights digging around the cross that he decided to write to Kit Williams to find out if he was wasting his time there. Williams encouraged him to continue, and on February 24th 1982, he found the treasure. It was worth L3000 in the beginning, but the excitement it had caused since its burial made it much more valuable. What is the subject discussed in the text?", "subject": ""}

The victims, a man and a woman were found dead on a road outside a plant in Nancai Industrial Park in Shunyi District at 9 p.m. Sunday. The northern district of Miyun recorded rainfall of 243 mm in 22 hours before 6 a.m. Monday, said Wei Jianmin, chief forecaster of the Beijing Observatory  . He said the rain is important to fill up Beijing's important water source of the Miyun Reservoir  , which has received 17 million cubic meters of water during the rain so far. Although the rain had little effect on traffic Monday, it caused a disorder in the city's busy air traffic. According to Beijing Capital International Airport's website, 329 flights were called off due to the rainstorm.

Dr Baltimore is an old hand at these sorts of discussions, for he was also a participant in the Asilomar conference, in 1975, which brought scientists together to discuss a safe way of using the then-new tcchnology of recombinant DNA, and whose recommendations influenced a generation of biotechnology researchers. Four decades on, the need for a similar sort of _ has arisen. The International Summit on Human Gene Editing has been held by the national scientific academies of three countries -- America, Britain and China. They are particularly concerned about whether gene editing should be used to make heritable changes to the human germ line, something Dr Baltimore described as a deep and troubling question. Like those of Asilomar, the conclusions of this meeting will not be binding. But the hope is that, again like Asilomar, a mixture of common sense and peer pressure will create a world in which scientists are trusted to regulate themselves, rather than having politicians and civil servants do it for them. The meeting is being held against a backdrop of rapid scientific advance, Since 2012 research into a new, easy-to-use editing tool called CRISPR-Cas9 has blossomed. This technique involves a piece of RNA (a chemical messenger, which can be used to recognise a target section of DNA) and an enzyme   called a nuclease that can snip unwanted genes out and paste new ones in. Public interest was aroused in April, when Chinese scientists announced they had edited genes in non-viable ( ) human embryos, and again in November when British researchers said they had successfully treated a one-year-old girl who had leukaemia ( ), using gene-edited T-cells. T-cells are part of the immune system that attack, among other things, tumour cells. The researchers altered T-cells from a healthy donor to encourage them to recognise and kill the patient's cancer, to make them immune to her leukaemia drug, and to ensure they did not attack her healthy cells. In another recent development, a firm called Edit as Medicine, which is based in Cambridge, Massachusetts, has said it hopes, in 2017, to start human clinical trials of CRISPR-Cas9 as a treatment for a rare genetic form of blindness known as Leber congenital amaurosis  . Though other companies are already testing gene-editing therapies, these employ older, clunkier forms of the technology that seem likely to have less commercial potential.

{"answer": 1, "choices": ["a news article", "a folktale", "realistic fiction", "historical fiction"], "question": "There's a small town in the central part of England called Gotham. Some say it's a town of fools. Others say all the villagers are wise. Let me tell you about the people of Gotham so you can decide for yourself. Long ago, England was ruled by a cruel king named John. One day, the people of Gotham heard that King John and his men would soon be riding through their town.This worried the villagers, for they knew the greedy king would demand food and accommodation for his men. What's more, if he saw anything to his liking, he would surely take it. A town meeting was called. After much discussion, the townspeople decided to cut down a number of huge trees to block the roads leading into Gotham. When King John and his men reached the outskirts of the village, they could not pass. Angry, King John ordered his men to go into the town and punish the villagers. When the king's officers finally made their way over the trees, they found a village of fools. Some say that was because the people of Gotham had a plan--they had decided to act like fools since they had never heard of anyone being punished for being a noodlehead. Others say that's just the way they were. In the village, the king's men encountered a man riding a donkey. The man was bent over because he carried a huge bag of grain on his own shoulders. He looked exhausted. One of the king's men approached him and asked, \"Why, in heaven's name, are you carrying that bag?

But you will find, as you read this book, that although pirates can be murderous and treacherous ,they can also be cowardly, superstitious, and easily led. As it turns out, that is fortunate for Jim Hawkins.     It's a brilliant story. Billy Bones, a retired seaman, comes to live at the Admiral Benbow inn. Jim is just a boy, but he can see that Billy Bones is a nervous man, always on the look-out for strangers arriving at the inn. And well he might be nervous, because he carries with him in his battered old sea-chest a map drawn by Captain Flint himself giving the whereabouts of all Flint's buried treasure! Captain Flint! -the most feared pirate ever to travel the high seas.     Well,Flint is dead, but there are plenty of men who served with Captain Flint still alive who will feel they have a fair claim to the treasure. The map, though, ends up in the possession of Jim Hawkins---(it's a near thing, read the book to see how that happens)     Jim tells the secret in the local doctor, who quickly joins forces to acquire a ship and crew to sail for Treasure Island     There's a famous scene where Jim, hiding in the apple barrel on deck, discovers that mutiny is planned. It's a bad moment. The numbers suggest that the pirates are going to have it all their own way. There are nineteen mutineers and seven honest men, including Jim.     And now, you will have to read the book for yourself. This is a fantastic tale of cheat, bravery and cowardice. I don't know how things would have turned out if it hadn't been for Jim Hawkins. For it is Jim who single-handedly steals the Hispaniola from under the very noses of the pirates and sails her round the island to a secret beaching place.     And do you know what happens to Long John Silver, the greatest double-crosser of them all? No? Well, don't expect me to tell you. Don't be nervous of reading a 'classic'. I know it was published a long time ago, but that doesn't mean it is difficult to read. There is one piece of advice I will give, though. I don't think this book is ever out of print---there are hundreds of different copies around.

It's a bad moment. The numbers suggest that the pirates are going to have it all their own way. There are nineteen mutineers and seven honest men, including Jim.     And now, you will have to read the book for yourself. This is a fantastic tale of cheat, bravery and cowardice. I don't know how things would have turned out if it hadn't been for Jim Hawkins. For it is Jim who single-handedly steals the Hispaniola from under the very noses of the pirates and sails her round the island to a secret beaching place.     And do you know what happens to Long John Silver, the greatest double-crosser of them all? No? Well, don't expect me to tell you. Don't be nervous of reading a 'classic'. I know it was published a long time ago, but that doesn't mean it is difficult to read. There is one piece of advice I will give, though. I don't think this book is ever out of print---there are hundreds of different copies around. If you can, choose a copy with large enough print to be able to read comfortably, and exciting illustrations. It makes all the difference.     Go ahead! Read the book. I think you'll love it.

He was referring to the difficulty people of his age had in using the new techniques, but also to the fact that younger surgeons, who are more comfortable with the technology, lack some of the wisdom of experience. It struck me that this problem is not just confined  to specialized fields such as medicine, but is widespread in modern life. There are many areas where the rapid growth of technology has widened the generation gap. Young people are at ease with modern technology and propose all sorts of ways for using and developing it. But they often lack the experience needed to see further into the future to the possible dangers that a particular development may cause. Older people see all sorts of difficulties and dangers, but are sometimes ignored, or even accused of being against progress, if they point out potential problems.

But its present education is not that respectable.   According to the Hurun Report, which conducted one-on-one interviews with 980 wealthy Chinese people with net assets of more than 60 million yuan ($9.5 million) in 18 mainland cities from May to September, about 14 percent of them said they had either already moved overseas or had applied to do so, and another 46 percent said they planned to emigrate within three years. All cited the higher-quality education available for their children overseas as the reason.   Such a mindset has resulted in a growing number of Chinese students studying abroad.   To be fair, our primary and high schools are a leader in content throughout the world. The Program for International Student Assessment last year offered a feather in the cap for our education. Participating in the program administered by the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development, teenagers in Shanghai were far in advance of their peers from 64 countries, including the United States, in reading literacy, mathematics and science.   So why does education in this country leave so many wealthy parents cold?   Children in China have no say in what they learn. They normally learn by rote and are forced to study the subjects that help them in examinations for a school of a higher grade, especially the college entrance exams.   Studies conducted by the China Youth and Children Research Center show that more than half of Chinese secondary school students study overtime and they don't get enough sleep. And more than 70 percent of students in primary and middle schools take after-school tutoring classes, which is considered a heavy burden on children.   And this situation turns many parents into demons like \"Wolf Father\" Xiao Baiyou in Guangdong province, who supported his children's learning with verbal abuse and physical violence. Xiao doesn't pale in comparison to Tiger Mother Amy Chua in the United States. He is satisfied with his parenting skills, as he has sent three of his four children to Peking University, one of China's most prestigious higher learning institutions.   Such ways of stimulating children to learn are certainly scary enough to make those Chinese parents with deep pockets choose a foreign school for their kids.

But talk to scientists in private, and many will complain why (besides jealousy, perhaps) are some scientists unhappy with the Nobels? One reason is that the committees can often be slow to recognize achievement. Alfred Nobel specified in his will that the prizes should reward work done in the previous year. But experience soon showed that this was risky, as medals were given out for discoveries that later proved questionable. So a degree of caution is probably advisable. Sometimes, though, it can lead to strange results. Subrahmanyan Chandrasekhar, for instance, had to wait until 1983 to win a prize for work he had done in the 1930s on the structure of stars. However, Albert Einstein never won a prize for his theory of relativity. Even though some pretty suggestive evidence had been produced by Arthur Eddington in 1919, relativity, which has later passed every experimental test ever thrown at it, was still considered somewhat risky and obscure. Another criticism concerns the tradition that no more than three people can share a prize. Science is rarely this clear-cut.

Walls of water as tall as 30 feet flooded into the coast and swept six miles inland, wiping out everything in the way. Many human survivors were separated from their pets. Many animal lovers went out of their way to help pets in need after the tsunami. And some pets helped their owners, too. When Kamata heard the tsunami alert  , he decided to visit his neighbours to warn them of the coming danger. He put his dog, Shane, in the yard so they could leave as soon as he returned. But later, as he headed home, the tsunami flooded into the city, destroying his path. Kamata was forced to run to higher ground, to a school that served as a shelter. He feared he would never see Shane again. Six hours later, Kamata heard that a dog was waiting outside the school. He went to look: It's Shane! The dog swam through the tsunami and found Kamata, even though Shane had never been to the school. After the huge earthquake ended, 83-year-old Tami Akanuma thought that she and her small dog, Babu, were safe. But Babu was anything but calm.

An example of the dangers of a restricted diet may be seen in the disease known as \"beri-beri\", which used to make large numbers of Eastern people who lived mainly on rice suffer. In the early years of last century, a Dutch scientist named Eijkman was trying to discover the cause of beri-beri. At first he thought it was transmitted by a germ   . He was working in a Japanese hospital, where the patients were fed on polished rice which had had the outer coverings removed from the grain, it was thought this would be easier for weak and sick people to digest. Eijkman thought his germ theory was proved when he noticed the chickens in the hospital yard, which were fed on remains from the patients' plates, were also showing signs of the disease. He then tried to separate the germ, which he thought was causing the disease, but his experiments were interrupted by a hospital official, who ordered that the rice without coverings, even though left over by the patients, was too good for chickens. It should be recooked for the patients, and the chickens should be fed on cheap, rough rice with the outer coverings still on the grain. Eijkman noticed that the chickens began to recover on the new diet. He began to consider the possibility that eating unmilled rice   somehow prevented or cured beri-beri--even that a lack of some ingredient   in the coverings may be the cause of the disease. Indeed this was the case. The element needed to prevent beri-beri was shortly afterwards separated from rice coverings and is now known as vitamin B.

But some researchers say that is what persons from thirteen to nineteen years old are doing. While teenagers can look all grown up, studies have shown that their brains are still developing. How much this explains their behavior, though, is a subject of debate. Jay Giedd of America's National Institutes of Health is a leader in this area of research. Doctor Giedd has been studying a group of young people since 1991. They visit him every two years for imaging tests of their brains. He says considerable development continues in young people from the teenage years into the twenties. A part of the brain called the dorsal-lateral prefrontal cortex appears especially undeveloped in teenagers. Researchers believe that this area controls judgment and consideration of risk. So, its underdevelopment may explain why young people seem more willing to take risks like driving too fast. Laurence Steinberg is a psychology professor at Temple University in Philadelphia. He says stronger laws and stronger parental control are needed to protect teens from themselves. That includes raising the age for driving. He says research shows that teenage brains are not fully equipped to control behavior. Other researchers, however, say there is not enough evidence to make a strong case for such findings. Psychologist Robert Epstein is a visiting scholar at the University of California in San Diego. Mr. Epstein notes that teen behavior differs from culture to culture. He says behavior depends for the most part on socialization. He believes that teenagers will demonstrate  better, safer behavior if they spend more time with adults, and are treated more like them. But is that always true? Mike Males works at the Center on Juvenile and Criminal Justice in San Francisco. He suggests that all of this talk lately about brainless teens could be an attempt to take away attention from the reality.

Using solar energy can help save our precious fuel. As you know, our supplies of oil and gas are very limited. There is just not enough on hand to meet all our future energy needs. Sooner or later Mother Nature will say that's all. The only way we can delay hearing those words is by starting to save energy now and by using other sources, like the sun.

For example, fossil fuel  adds to already high pollution levels. With solar energy, we will still need sources of energy, but we won't need as much. That means we can cut down on our pollution problems. With all these good points, why don't we use more solar power? There are many reasons for this. The biggest reason is money.

Others like mysteries that lead the reader to an exciting discovery. The story of the young British naturalist Charles Darwin combines both of these. That is why the author and illustrator  Rosalyn Schanzer chose to write the children's book \"What Darwin Saw\". The book was published just in time for the 200th anniversary of Charles Darwin's birth on February 12, 1809. Rosalyn Schanzer carefully gathered Darwin's thoughts and observations from his diaries, letters and books. Many of the words in the book are Darwin's own. She also traveled to the Galapagos Islands and South America. She researched some of the places Darwin had visited on his trip on the ship, the Beagle in the 1830s. She took thousands of pictures, which helped her create the book's beautiful and color1ful drawings. These pictures show young readers what led Darwin to form his great discovery: the evolution of species through natural selection. \"What Darwin Saw\" tells of the adventures of a young man who traveled around the world as a scientist. The voyage of the Beagle took Charles Darwin to South America, where he rode horses with cowboys and met Native Americans in Argentina. He reported the eruption of the Osorno Volcano and experienced an earthquake in Chile. Darwin's observations showed him that environments can change very quickly and a great deal over time. Rosalyn Schanzer brings to life the clues that suggested to Darwin that living things evolve, or change, over time. She illustrates the unusual tortoises, birds and lizards that Darwin studied in the Galapagos Islands. She shows how Darwin came to understand that these island animals had differences, developed over time, that helped them survive.

{"answer": 2, "choices": ["Economic crisis.", "The senate voting.", "Dispute on the budget bill.", "Lazy people across the country."], "question": "The United States government is back in business. Early Thursday morning, President Barack Obama signed a bill to reopen the government. The budget bill, drafted by Senate late on Wednesday night, raised the government's debt ceiling and averted a serious economic crisis. \"With the shutdown behind us,\" Obama said after the Senate vote, \"we now have an opportunity to focus on a sensible budget that is responsible, that is fair and that helps hardworking people all across this country.\" Now that a settlement has been reached, formerly furloughed employees have returned to work, national museums and parks are reopening, and the government's gears are slowly beginning to turn again. Before the shutdown, a federal funding bill went back and forth between the Senate and the House. A major issue was whether or not the government would pay for changes in Obama's healthcare plan. The Senate, with a Democratic majority, wanted to pass a budget that would fund the new healthcare law. But the House, which has a Republican majority, did not want government money used that way. Because an agreement could not be reached on a budget plan, the government was forced to partially shut down. Sixteen days later, _ have come together to pass a measure that raised the country's debt ceiling. The debt ceiling is the strict legal limit Congress places on the amount of money that can be borrowed each year. Had this agreement not been met by October 17, the U.S. may not have been able to pay its promised payments. This legislation, or law, will fund the government through January 15. During this time, Obama and Congress will work on a long-term spending plan. The effects of the two-week government shutdown were widespread. In addition to national parks, museums, memorials and monuments were off-limits to visitors. Workers at government-run organizations like NASA and the Environmental Protection Agency were furloughed.

The organic matter may partially break down, using up the dissolved oxygen in the sediment. As soon as the oxygen is gone, decay stops and the remaining organic matter is preserved. Continued sedimentation buries the organic matter and subjects it to higher temperatures and pressures, which change the organic matter to oil and gas. As muddy sediments are pressed together, the gas and small drops of oil may be squeezed out of the mud and may move into sandy layers nearby. Over millions of years, accumulations of gas and oil can collect in the sandy layers. Both oil and gas are less dense than water, so they generally tend to rise upward through rock and sediment. Oil pools are valuable underground accumulations of oil, and oil fields are regions underlain by one or more oil pools. When an oil pool or field is discovered, wells are drilled into the ground. When the well reaches a pool, oil usually rises up the well because of its density difference  with water beneath it or because of the pressure of expanding gas trapped above it. Although this rise of oil is almost always carefully controlled today, strong natural flows of oil were common in the past. Gas pressure gradually dies out, and oil is pumped from the well. Water or steam may be pumped down neighboring wells to help push the oil out. As oil becomes increasingly difficult to find, the search for it is extended into more unfriendly environments. The development of the oil field on the North Slope of Alaska and the construction of the Alaska pipeline are examples of the great expense and difficulty involved in new oil discoveries. Offshore drilling platforms extend the search for oil to the ocean's continental shelves. More than one-quarter of the world's oil and almost one-fifth of the world's natural gas come from offshore, even though offshore drilling is six to seven times more expensive than drilling on land.

The development of the oil field on the North Slope of Alaska and the construction of the Alaska pipeline are examples of the great expense and difficulty involved in new oil discoveries. Offshore drilling platforms extend the search for oil to the ocean's continental shelves. More than one-quarter of the world's oil and almost one-fifth of the world's natural gas come from offshore, even though offshore drilling is six to seven times more expensive than drilling on land. Of course, there is far more oil underground than can be recovered. Even given the best exploration techniques, only about 30 to 40 percent of the oil in a given pool can be brought to the surface. The rest is far too difficult to reach and has to remain underground. What can we infer from the passage?", "subject": ""}

General1y, if the person is someone you really want to talk to, you will focus on him. Most other people will only get about half of your attention. You may think that this is OK, because if you don't really want to talk to him, then what does it matter if you don't give him your full attention? Consider two things. First, you may just not realize the importance of that conversation.

Everyone knows that \"smoking is bad for you\", but do smokers really know what the health warnings mean to them? Smoking, the world's second leading cause of preventable death, kills 4.9 million people a year, the United Nations said on February 27. The world has about l.2 billion smokers and World Health Organization surveys show that about 20 per cent of them are children aged between 13 and 15 years old. On the same day, a global treaty  aimed at encouraging children not to smoke and help people kick the habit came into force. This is the first worldwide agreement on a public health issue. It will see strong warnings added to cigarette packets and a ban on all tobacco advertising. Young smokers may think little of the health effects of smoking. But smoking can stop them from making friends, as most non-smokers don't like being around smokers. \"I feel sick when I see people of my age smoke. Smokers make themselves look less educated ,\" said Shi Qingyu, a Senior 3 student at Luanxian No 1 High School in Hebei Province. Once while on a bus, he asked a girl who was smoking next to him to put out her cigarette.

While he did not quite achieve that goal, only 15 years later, he was a millionaire. And by 1992, as head of the Microsoft company, he became the richest man in America with assets of nearly US $ 6.3 billion. Born in Seattle, Washington on 28, October, 1956, Gates was named William Henry after his father and grandfather. From the beginning, he was an extremely energetic and intelligent child. He had read the entire world book encyclopedia by the age of nine. His favorite subjects at school were science and math and his favorite pastime was \"thinking\". Gates first started to play with computers at the age of 13. Before long he became an expert at working the school's computer. After his graduation from secondary school, Gates was accepted by the three top universities in the USA-Princeton, Harvard and Yale. He chose Harvard and began classes there the next autunm, majoring maths. But he was still obsessed with computers and spent as much time in the computer laboratories as he did in the lecture halls. By 1975, Gates and a partner, Paul Allen, had developed a software program called BASIC. This was not the first program ever created, but its inventors were the first to decide that people who wanted to use it should pay for it. BASIC was a success because until it came along, there had been no efficient way of getting computers to carry out instructions. Although he had not completed his degree, Gates left university and went to work full time for the new company he had formed called Microsoft. His next project was the software program that made him famous and very rich. It was called DOS, short for Disk Operating System, and it was purchased by IBM in 1980. Today it is the operating system used in more than 14 million personal computers around the world. As chief executive officer of Microsoft, Gates is known as a bright man, but one who is not easily satisfied.

He was regarded as a loner and unfashionable boring computer nut until his marriage to Microsoft manager Melinda French on New Year's Day 1994.

After his graduation from secondary school, Gates was accepted by the three top universities in the USA-Princeton, Harvard and Yale. He chose Harvard and began classes there the next autunm, majoring maths. But he was still obsessed with computers and spent as much time in the computer laboratories as he did in the lecture halls. By 1975, Gates and a partner, Paul Allen, had developed a software program called BASIC. This was not the first program ever created, but its inventors were the first to decide that people who wanted to use it should pay for it. BASIC was a success because until it came along, there had been no efficient way of getting computers to carry out instructions. Although he had not completed his degree, Gates left university and went to work full time for the new company he had formed called Microsoft. His next project was the software program that made him famous and very rich. It was called DOS, short for Disk Operating System, and it was purchased by IBM in 1980. Today it is the operating system used in more than 14 million personal computers around the world. As chief executive officer of Microsoft, Gates is known as a bright man, but one who is not easily satisfied. He is quick to criticize his staff and hates to be questioned about decisions he has made. He was regarded as a loner and unfashionable boring computer nut until his marriage to Microsoft manager Melinda French on New Year's Day 1994. Yet to many people now, Gates, is a person who is, in spite of his great wealth, humble and ordinary. He spends his money carefully. He eats in fast food restaurants and flies economy class.

In September, scientists announced at the National Snow and Ice Data   Center that Arctic summer sea ice had fallen to its second lowest level since 1979, and probably long before that. The Arctic has lost an area of ice greater than the area of all U.S. states east of the Mississippi River. And what ice remains appears to be getting thinner and weaker. Nick Toberg and Till Wagner are polar ice scientists who are doing sea ice fieldwork. \"There is plenty of data to suggest that the ice is becoming thinner as well as smaller in area,\" they say.

From an early age, he loved the sea. Ballard grew up in Southern California. He spent his free time at the beach near his home. He enjoyed fishing and swimming. He even learned to dive.

Ballard decided he wanted to be like Captain Nemo when he grew up. His parents helped him follow his dream. Ballard was a hardworking student. He spent many years learning all he could about the ocean. By the age of 28, he was an expert. In 1970, he took a job as a scientist at Woods Hole Oceanographic Institute in Massachusetts. There he studied underwater mountains of the Atlantic Ocean. He came up with ways to predict volcanoes under the oceans. Working with other scientists, Ballard also found previously unknown sea animals. These animals lived far below the ocean's surface, where scientists had believed no animals could live. By the 1980s, Ballard's interests changed. He developed unmanned vehicles to explore the ocean bottom. His first find, the well-known ship Titanic, made Ballard famous. He was not happy with just one big find, however. He looked for -- and found -- other well-known ships. One was the German battleship Bismarck. Another was the U.S. Yorktown, an aircraft carrier that sank during World War II. Today Robert Ballard is still an underwater explorer.

From an early age, he loved the sea. Ballard grew up in Southern California. He spent his free time at the beach near his home. He enjoyed fishing and swimming. He even learned to dive. When Ballard wasn't at the ocean, he loved reading about it. At age 10, he read 20,000 Leagues Under the Sea, a book which describes the undersea adventures of Captain Nemo. Ballard decided he wanted to be like Captain Nemo when he grew up. His parents helped him follow his dream. Ballard was a hardworking student. He spent many years learning all he could about the ocean. By the age of 28, he was an expert. In 1970, he took a job as a scientist at Woods Hole Oceanographic Institute in Massachusetts. There he studied underwater mountains of the Atlantic Ocean. He came up with ways to predict volcanoes under the oceans. Working with other scientists, Ballard also found previously unknown sea animals. These animals lived far below the ocean's surface, where scientists had believed no animals could live. By the 1980s, Ballard's interests changed. He developed unmanned vehicles to explore the ocean bottom. His first find, the well-known ship Titanic, made Ballard famous. He was not happy with just one big find, however. He looked for -- and found -- other well-known ships. One was the German battleship Bismarck. Another was the U.S. Yorktown, an aircraft carrier that sank during World War II. Today Robert Ballard is still an underwater explorer. He also heads an organization that encourages students to learn about science. Ballard hopes that some of the students will follow in his footsteps. After all, the world's huge oceans are mostly unknown. Who knows what remains to be discovered under the sea? What can we learn from the text?", "subject": ""}

In China's Qinling Mountains, giant pandas spend most of their day eating bamboo. The plant makes up 99% of the panda's diet, with some pandas eating about 40 pounds of it a day. But Qinling's pandas may soon have to find another food source. A new study cause the loss of most of the region's bamboo by the end of the century. A team made up of researchers from Michigan State University and the Chinese Academy of Sciences studied the effects of climate change on the region's three main bamboo species. They studied the influence of rising temperatures on the spread and growth of bamboo. Bamboo is sensitive to temperature changes. \"Even with a 3.6 degrees Fahrenheit increase in temperature, we found that 80% to 100% of bamboo would be gone by the end of the century,\" Liu Jianguo, one of the study's authors said. Shirley Martin, who came from Paris but not involved in the team said that it's really a demanding challenge for us to get a desired result. The Qinling Mountains, located in eastern China, are home to about 270 pandas. That is about 17% of the world's wild panda population. The panda is one of the world's most endangered species. In recent years, China has stepped up efforts to protect pandas. But Liu says the country has yet to consider the long-term efforts of climate change in its conservation planning. Aside from increasing nature reserve areas where pandas are protected, Liu wants China to lower its use of fuels that release greenhouse gases-as should the rest of the world. \" The future of pandas,\" he says, \" is in our hands.\" The researchers in the team come from   _  .", "subject": ""}

But Qinling's pandas may soon have to find another food source. A new study cause the loss of most of the region's bamboo by the end of the century. A team made up of researchers from Michigan State University and the Chinese Academy of Sciences studied the effects of climate change on the region's three main bamboo species. They studied the influence of rising temperatures on the spread and growth of bamboo. Bamboo is sensitive to temperature changes. \"Even with a 3.6 degrees Fahrenheit increase in temperature, we found that 80% to 100% of bamboo would be gone by the end of the century,\" Liu Jianguo, one of the study's authors said. Shirley Martin, who came from Paris but not involved in the team said that it's really a demanding challenge for us to get a desired result. The Qinling Mountains, located in eastern China, are home to about 270 pandas. That is about 17% of the world's wild panda population. The panda is one of the world's most endangered species. In recent years, China has stepped up efforts to protect pandas. But Liu says the country has yet to consider the long-term efforts of climate change in its conservation planning.

{"answer": 3, "choices": ["prevents students watching movies", "provides students with well-known movies", "encourages students to write novels", "provides guidance on teaching and learning"], "question": "As more and more books become movie adaptations  , I can't help but think how this will affect English classes in America. Thinking back to my years in middle and high school -- ten years ago, I would be rewarded if I had read a number of classics. Today, a majority of those books are now also movies Life of Pi, The Great Gatsby, Much Ado About Nothing and Anna Karenina, to name a few. Even modern books such as The Hunger Games and Harry Potter have been adapted for the big screen. In discussion with my students, I often hear them say they are not going to read books because movies will come out soon, which makes me wonder what effect movie adaptations have on modern-day students. Will the Common Core State Standards (CCSS) encourage them to read books more carefully or to use movies to improve their understanding of the text? The CCSS requires students to provide text-based evidence when reading and discussing a book. By focusing on such evidence, teachers can pull specific details from a book that may have not made the final cut when the book was adapted for the big screen. For instance, after reading and watching The Hunger Games, there were a number of details from the book that were missing from the film -- many people were disappointed with Rue's meek   movie role. A student who failed to read The Hunger Games would not quite understand Rue's impact on the games in the same way as someone who had read the book and remembered all the details that went into her death. I am not saying the CCSS will stop students from cutting corners, but I believe if teachers use the support the CCSS provides, it can be a great roadway to ensure all students are digging deep into texts and not just hitting the play button.

During lunchtime at school,some girls who were my brother's friends told him about a plan that they had to toilet paper a guy's house. They had already been playing pranks  on this guy,and they were laughing about what his house would look like when they were through with it. My brother told me later that he knew what they were planning on doing was wrong,but he didn't say anything to the girls.  _ .      That night my brother's six friends stayed overnight at one of the girls' houses. In the middle of the night,they sneaked out of the house. They piled into one of the gifts' small blue car and set off to play their little prank. When they got to the guy's house, everything went as planned---until they got caught. The guy that they were playing the prank on came outside and saw them. Laughing,they all ran to the ear and hopped in,hoping to get away. The guy got into his car and chased after them,trying to identify them. He was right on their tail,and it scared the girls really badly, They were not sure what he would do to them if he caught them, so they went faster.     Then,when they were turning on a blind curve in the road,they lost control of the car and hit a tree head-on. Three of the girls were ejected from the car and were killed instantly. The other three girls were seriously injured. One of the girls had just enough strength to get out of the car and go to a nearby house. The people who answered the door were afraid of her and didn't even believe that there had been an accident. They said,\"Yeah, right,you really got into a wreck,\"and they would not call the police.      The three girls that died were all honor roll students and were looking ahead to doing something great with their lives. But all of their dreams were shattered when they hit the tree on that cold night. Only one of my brother's friends was wearing a seat belt,and she was one of the survivors. Now when ever I get into a car, I think about the accident and put on my seat belt.     The guy that chased them went to court. All he got was a ticket for running a stop sign and for speeding.

There are two age sections: Junior: 7 to11 Senior: 12 to 16 This competition is based on the Young First Aid Course from St. John Ambulance Training Officer. Support will be given to make sure everyone has equal chances to win. The winners of this competition will be invited to take part in the Young Grand Prior Competition. This competition improves the practical first aid skills of young people and tests their knowledge and skills with a series of realistic accidents and injuries. Youth teams are aged between 12 and 16 years old and should have three members. Young adults are aged between 17 and 21 and should have two members. All teams may bring a reserve. The Young Grand Prior Competition will be held at the Spa Complex, Scarborough, on November 28, 2012. Those who want to take part in the national schools' first aid competition will have to complete our application form. The passage is written mainly for   _  .", "subject": ""}
{"answer": 3, "choices": ["Plants cells can store more energy than animal cells.", "Plant cells have a nucleus in the center.", "Animal cells are bigger than plant cells.", "Animals cells have a nucleus in the center."], "question": "Cells were discovered in 1665 by Robert Hooke when he took a piece of cork and looked at it under a microscope. Cork is made up of dead cells but you are still able to see the cells which proved to be interesting to him. He described  _ as being made of something, just like a wall is made of bricks. He then called those bricks \"cells\". Due to the size of cells, it is nearly impossible to see them without the aid of a light microscope, but by using an electron microscope you'd be able to see cells in much greater detail. There's a cell theory which is made up of four basic ideas. First, cells are the building blocks of life. Second, cells are derived from other cells by division. Third, cells contain DNA (the blueprint for life). Fourth, the cell is the functioning unit of life, and the chemical reactions of life take place within cells. There are two types of cells, animal cells and plant cells. Plant cells differ from animal cells in many ways. Plant cells have a large central vacuole , with the nucleus  nearer to the side of the cell instead of in the middle like in animal cells. Another big difference is that plant cells can produce and store sugar as starch  while animal cells contain glycogen . It's noteworthy to mention that a cell cannot survive without the nucleus which acts as a type of control center; it runs the cells. The nucleus contains DNA, which in turn contains the cell's genes. These genes tell the cell how to grow. DNA contains the genetic blueprint that tells if you have blonde hair and blue eyes. Which of the following statement is TRUE?", "subject": ""}

This beautifully animated film   is a first class production in every way, and features the familiar voices of Kristin Chenoweth, Anjelica Huston, Jane Horrocks, Lucy Liu, and Raven Symone. The movie offers up an adventure that's easy enough to follow, but complex enough to hold one's attention, and even throws in a nice little moral about friendship. What can I say? I'm pleasantly surprised.                                    The up-and-coming Mae Whitman voices Tinker Bell herself, a far more dynamic character than we met in Peter Pan. Though Tinker still possesses her fiery temper, it doesn't manifest itself immediately, and takes a backseat to this pixie's many good qualities. As it turns out, Tinker Bell is extremely skilled at tinkering , so she is a natural choice to build a special scepter , for Pixie Hollow's Autumn Celebration. The scepter will hold the moonstone through which the light of the Blue Moon will pass, supplying Pixie Hollow with enough pixie dust for the year ahead.      For days, Tinkers works hard on the perfect scepter design while her good friend Terrence does his best to assist. When Terrence accidentally breaks the Moon Stone, Tinker Bell \"explodes\" and sends him away. One of Tinker's more literal friends finds this extremely concerning, as she doesn't quite understand that the outburst was emotional rather than physical ----- very funny indeed.      After hearing the legend of the lost treasure, Tinker Bell strikes out on her own to find a new Moon Stone. She faces many difficulties and meets new friends along the way, but when Terrence comes to the rescue at Tinker's darkest hour, she realizes the value of a truly loyal friend.

Nuclear radiation has a certain mystery about it, partly because it cannot be detected by human senses. It can't be seen or heard, or touched or tasted, even though it may be all around us. There are other things like that. For example, radio waves are all around us but we can't detect them, sense them, without a radio receiver. Similarly, we can't sense radioactivity without a radiation detector. But unlike common radio waves, nuclear radiation is not harmless to human beings and other living things.  At very high levels, radiation can kill an animal or human being immediately by killing masses of cells in vital organs. But even the lowest levels can do serious damage. There is no levels of radiation that is completely safe. If the radiation does not hit anything important, the damage may not be serious. This is the case when only a few cells are hit, and if they are killed immediately. Your body will replace the dead cells with healthy ones. But if the few cells are only damaged, and if they reproduce themselves, you may be in trouble. They can grow into cancer. Sometimes this does not show up for many years.  This is another reason for some of the mystery about nuclear radiation. Serious damage can be done without the victim being aware at the time that damage has occurred. A person can be irradiated and feel fine, then die for cancer five, ten, or twenty years later as a result. Or a child can be born weak as a result of radiation absorbed by its grandparents.

Most people know that states in the United States have different laws about the legal drinking age; this age varies, but in most states no one under twenty-one can buy alcohol, even beer or wine.

Most funny stories are based on comic situations.In spite of national differences, certain funny situations have a worldwide request.No matter where you live, you would find it difficult not to laugh at, say ,Charlie Chaplin's early films.However, a new type of humour, which stems largely from America, has recently come into fashion.It is called \"sick humour\".Comedians base their jokes on tragic situations like violent (cause by force)death or serious accidents.Many people find this sort of joke distasteful.The following example of \"sick humour\" will enable you to judge for yourself. A man who had broken his right leg was taken to hospital a few weeks before Christmas.From the moment he arrived there, he kept on pestering  his doctor tell him when he would be able to go home.He was afraid of having to spend Christmas in hospital .Though the doctor did his best, the patient's recovery was slow.On Christmas day, however, the doctor consoled him by telling him that his chances of being able to leave hospital in time for New Year celebrations were good.The man took heart and, sure enough , on New Year's Eve he was able to hobble  along to a party.To compensate for his unpleasant experiences in hospital , the man drank a little more than what was good for him.In the process, he enjoyed himself and kept telling everybody how much he hated hospitals.He was still mumbling something about hospitals at the end of the party when he slipped on a piece of ice and broke his left leg.

{"answer": 3, "choices": ["their moods", "their feelings", "their interests", "all the above"], "question": "Music comes in many forms; most countries have a style of their own. The US is well known for jazz  , which has gained world-wide popularity. In contrast to classical   music, which follows formal European traditions, jazz is natural and free-form. It is full of energy, expressing the moods, interests, and feelings of the people. It has a modern sound that makes people very excited. In the 1920s jazz sounded like America. And So it does today. The origins of this music are as interesting as the music itself. Jazz was produced by American blacks, who were brought to the Southern States as slaves. They were sold to plantation owners   and forced to work long hours in the cotton and tobacco fields. This work was hard and life was short. When a Negro died, his friends and relatives formed a group to carry the body to the cemetery. A band often went with them. On the way to the cemetery the band played slow and sad music. But on the way home the mood changed. _ Everybody was happy. Death had removed one of their members, but the living were glad to be alive. The band played happy music, which made everyone want to dance. It was an early form of jazz. Music has always been important in their lives.

I managed to spot a policeman and attempted to explain my destination to him in simple English, praying that he would understand. I wasn't sure that he did but I just followed him anyway as I had no choice. He took me on a bus and I didn't know where I was going. Luckily, I met a student who explained to me in English that the policeman was taking me to another bus station where I could take a bus to Xiahe. During this conversation a third man said he was also a policeman and would help me buy tickets. But as he was not in uniform, I was a little doubtful. The uniformed policeman told me it was OK to go with the third man, so I got off the bus with the so-called policeman who at this point, disappeared and I was left in the middle of nowhere. I stood panicking. Around one minute later a police car came and stopped right by me. It was the un-uniformed policeman.

There are several ways of measuring the intelligence of animals. In one test a scientist sets three same cans on a table. While the animal watches, he puts food under one of the cans. Then he leads the animal away. Some time later, he brings it back to see if it remembers which can has the food. No smelling is allowed; the animal must go directly to the correct can or it fails. This is called a delayed-response test. The idea is to find out how long an animal's memory can keep information. The scientists would try showing the cans to the animal one hour later, or two hours later, or even a full day later. They discovered that chimpanzees and elephants have the best memory, and were able to remember the correct can for at least twenty hours. No other animal is close. Dogs came next, but they only remember for nine hours. To settle the matter, the scientists designed a huge maze   and ran the chimps and elephants through it. The maze was very difficult, with many blind paths and dead ends. It took the chimps ten minutes to find their way out. The elephants needed half an hour. Even allowing for the elephants' slower rate of speed, the test shows that chimpanzees are the cleverest animals. From this and other tests, the scientists drew the following conclusion: an animal's intelligence depends on the size of its brain in proportion   to the size of its body. The elephant's brain weighs ten pounds. But this is only 1/600th of its 6,000 pounds body. A chimp's brain weighs about one pound, or 1/120th of its total body weight.

Development experts have debated this question for decades. Some think the act of paying causes people to value something and use it more. Selling necessary health treatments, others argue, may deny them to the people who need them the most. Consider, for example, chemically treated bed nets, which kill mosquitoes anti protect people against malaria while they are sleeping. William Easterly, an economist at New York University, believes this is one example of development having gone wrong. In a recent book, Professor Easterly suggests bed nets given free in Africa are often used for the wrong purpose. Yet, the World Health Organization (WHO) recommends bed nets be given out free and used by whole communities. The success of a large free bed net campaign in Kenya led the WHO to announce this recommendation This debate will likely influence social programs in the developing world. Many non-governmental organizations support the creation of self-supporting programs in poor countries. Goods and services are sold for a price to help these programs survive. According to Rachel Glenerster, who runs a research lab doing development and poverty studies at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology, her several studies have proven that small price changes have a big influence on the number of people who use a product. A price change will reduce the total amount of use of the product as well, she says. She has also found no evidence that the very act of paying for something changes how people use it. As for a particular product among special populations, some development experts argue that pricing is useful. When it comes to bed nets, Miss Glenerster says research shows no evidence of this. People are just as likely to use a bed net whether they paid for it or not. The debate among experts focuses on  _  .", "subject": ""}

{"answer": 0, "choices": ["twins communicate with each other in an unusual way", "twins are more likely to suffer from speaking problems", "most twins have exceptional abilities to invent a new language", "twins won't have an effective communication until they go to school"], "question": "It is well-known that twins are closer to each other than most brothers and sisters ---- after all, they probably spend more time with each other. Parents of twins often notice that they develop special ways of communicating: they invent their own words and one can often finish the other's sentence. In exceptional circumstances, this closeness becomes more extreme: they invent a whole language of their own, as in the case of Grace and Virginia Kennedy from Georgia in the USA, who communicated so successfully in their own special language that they did not speak any English at all until after they started school.  However, these special relationships are the result of lives spent almost entirely in each other's company. What happens when twins do not grow up together, when they are separated at birth for some reason? Are they just like any other strangers, or are there still special similarities between them? Professor Tom Bouchard, of the University of Minnesota, set out to find the answer to this question. He traced sixteen pairs of twins, who were adopted by different families when they were babies, and often brought up in very different circumstances. Each twin was then interviewed about every small detail of their life. The results of this research make a surprising reading. Many of the twins were found to have the same hobbies, many have suffered the same illnesses, and some have even had the same type of accident at the same point in their lives.

It also works to bring back emotional peace as well as physical health. This is why after a Tui Na treatment many people \"feel good\". Many people in China use Tui Na regularly to keep healthy and to deal with some specific illnesses. Tui Na is performed on the clothed body and the patient is either lying on a couch or sitting on a chair. Therapists , by using a variety of movements, will control the intensity  and direction of pressure in an exact way. The unique rolling movement in Tui Na is one of the most difficult movements to learn and students have to practice sometimes for many months on a rice bag before they are allowed to practice on the human body. Stress  Tui Na is of course very useful for treating stress. It spreads the energy around the whole body. It is believed that Tui Na moves the strong energy in the tight muscles to the weaker areas, thus making a more balanced body. When your energy flowing inside your body is balanced, you feel relaxed and comfortable. Tui Na is especially useful for  _ shoulders and tight neck muscles. Emotions  In Traditional Chinese Medicine each major organ  is linked to an emotion. By balancing the energy in the organ, the related emotion will be calmed. When your emotions are out of control, you would usually turn to your doctor or perhaps a psychotherapist  . But perhaps some people would not like to be seeing a psychotherapist or feel nervous about discussing their problems with others. With Tui Na, one does not need to tell the therapist anything one does not want to. The treatment of Tui Na can deal with the problem itself. But if one does need to pour out his/her worries or troubles, an active dialogue between the psychotherapist and the patient will help to get a better effect. Organs & Emotions  Each major organ -- the heart, the stomach, the liver  , the lungs, and etc.--are linked to a relevant emotion. The heart is linked to joy, excitement and sadness. If the heart is out of balance, the patient may dream a lot at night and often forget something important in the day. The stomach is connected with too much thinking or worrying about anxiety. When the stomach is out of balance there is often a lack of energy. The patient often feels very tired and has no interest in doing anything at all. The liver is linked to anger. In Chinese medicine, the eyes are connected with the liver, and many people who suffer from anger often suffer from eye problems. The lung rules decision-making and too much energy here can lead to rashness  , while if there is too little, it can bring about indecision. When there is a history of depression with a patient, it may have effect on the liver. ks5u Tui Na can help release most of the discomfort and it is used in almost all the hospitals in China and very popular among Chinese people. It is a useful and valuable method for the balance of your energy flowing, when emotional and physical health is out of balance. Tui Na is one of the remaining secrets of Chinese medicine.

During this time, the body recovers from the activities of the previous day. The rest that you get while sleeping enables your body to prepare itself for the next day.

Lang, the leading researcher of the University of Erlangen-Nuremberg in Germany.\" Pessimism  about the future may encourage people to live more carefully, taking health and safety measures.\" Lang and colleagues examined data collected from 1993 to 2003 for the national German Socio-Economic Panel, an annual survey on approximately 40,000 people from 18 to 96 years old. The researchers divided the data according to age groups: 18 to 39 years old, 40 to 64 years old and 65 years old and above. Through mostly in-person interviews, the participants were asked to rate how satisfied they were with their lives and how satisfied they thought they would be in five years. Five years after the first interview, 43 percent of the oldest group had underestimated  their future life satisfaction, 25 percent had predicted accurately and 32 percent had overestimated  , according to the study. The researchers calculated that each increase in overestimating future life satisfaction was related to a 9.5 -percent increase in reporting disabilities and a 10- percent increase in risk of death.  Because a darker outlook on the future is often more realistic, older adults' predictions of their future satisfaction may be more accurate, according to the study. In contrast, the youngest group had the sunniest outlook.  \"We argue, though, that the analysis may depend on age and available resources. These findings shed new light on how our perspectives can either help us take action or prevent us from taking action that can help improve our chances of a long, healthy life,\" Lang said.

Zachary's attitude to the Internet is in line with the study's findings, confirming that teens, who have never known a world without online access, generally have a more positive view of the Internet than their parents.
