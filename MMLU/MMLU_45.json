The book tells the story of a man who is shipwrecked  . He spends 28 years on an island near Venezuela. The book tells the story of everything that happens to Robinson Crusoe. He hopes someone will rescue him, but he has been there for so long on his own that he also begins to fear being rescued. Robinson Crusoe was published in 1719. Most experts believe the story is based on the life of Alexander Selkirk, who was a Scottish sailor. On an expedition   in 1704, Selkirk had an argument with his ship's captain. Selkirk thought the ship was not safe and was about to fall apart. When the ship stopped at a remote island to get fresh water, Selkirk got off. He tried to get the other crew members to leave with him, but nobody would. The shop then sailed away without him. Selkirk spent four years and four months on his own on the island, known as Aguas Buenas. Selkirk was finally rescued by a ship that visited the island in 1709. The ship's captain was grateful to Selkirk because he provided food for the crew when they arrived. Now archaeologists think they have found the remains of Selkirk's camp on Aguas Buenas. They found two deep holes that would have held wooden posts. The archaeologists say this is evidence that Selkirk built a shelter there. The post holes are near a fresh water stream. They are located quite high up, which would have meant that Selkirk was able to watch out for the ships coming close to the island. The most interesting evidence, the archaeologists say, is part of a piece of equipment used by sailors to navigate  . Historians believe Selkirk was a navigator, so the instrument could have belonged to him. Robinson Crusoe was published ten years after Selkirk was rescued. Most experts think Daniel Defoe heard and read stories about Selkirk, which inspired him to write the book. Why did Selkirk choose to land on the remote island?", "subject": ""}

In modern usage, it is often stated as an indirect way of asking what someone is thinking about. This phrase is basically a proposal  , and the speaker is offering to pay to hear the listener's thoughts. It is an idiom, of course, and not meant literally   so no real payment generally takes place. When the saying originated, a penny was worth a lot more than it is in the 21st century. Therefore, \"a penny for your thoughts\" likely indicated the thoughts were more valuable to those asking the listener for them than they are by today's standards. This loss of value can be used ironically , however, through tone  of voice; it can be used to indicate that someone's idea is bad or worth a penny in modern value. The phrase is generally credited to a man by the name of John Heywood, who was born sometime just before the 16th century. During his life, he was a writer who penned many plays and a book in 1546, later known as The Proverbs of John Heywood. It is likely Heywood did not actually come up with the phrase \"a penny for your thoughts\". Rather, he was simply the first person to have set the phrase down in written form. The actual origins of the term are unknown, and since his book was simply a collection of common idioms and expressions, it was probably familiar to people in the mid 1500s. Another phrase similar to \"a penny for your thoughts\" is offering \"your two cents\" after making a statement. Someone might give his or her opinion and then say, \"that's my two cents,\" to indicate the value of his or her idea.

Here is a list of colors, which can change your life. Blue/Purple Blue is considered to be peaceful and calming and it has the same effect on our health. The blue / purple color in food is due primarily to their anthocyanins which are antioxidants   that are particularly heart healthy and may help support healthy blood pressure. Out of all the blue and purple foods available, blueberries are considered to have the highest antioxidant level. An analysis of the latest data from the National Health and Nutrition Examination Study found that people who eat purple and blue fruits and vegetables are at a reduced risk for high blood pressure and are less likely to be overweight.

Opportunities are all around us but when you're networking, only focus on one. 4. Change positions too often.

They call people during dinner or on the weekends without thinking whether the occasion is suitable. 6. Distribute too many cards and sales literature. They come while loading with brochures, flyers  , catalogues and samples. 7. Focus on themselves. Too much self promotion can leave the other person to feel unappreciated. Every sentence begins with \"I\" and is all about their business. 8. \"Talking\" instead of \"giving\". They don't realize what other people sense when they are being very selfish. Others may think that they are being taken advantage of. 9. Lack authenticity   and personal values. They may create unrealistic expectations and not deliver on their promises.

But for Laura Dekker, sailing around the globe seems less a price to be paid than a prize to be treasured. As the 19-year-old Dutch sailor said in Maidentrip, a documentary released last year about her experience of becoming the youngest person to sail around the world alone in 2012, \"I was born on a boat. I lived my first five years at sea. And ever since, all I have wanted is to return to that life.\" With her yacht Guppy, Dekker began her journey at 14 and sailed 50,004 kilometers in 519 days. The flying fish keeping her company, the dolphins following in her wake and the warm days spent on deck playing the flute as she watched another unforgettable sunset were enough to make others jealous. But these didn't always go well. There were terrible moments in which Dekker feared death. On one occasion, a whale almost turned Guppy over. Another time, she battled extreme winds and Guppy surfed down 8-meter-high waves. Out on the open sea alone, she also got used to living without a fridge, a flushing toilet, and a hot shower. \"As a human being you don't need much,\" she told Stuff.co.nz. \" They might make life more comfortable, but you really don't need them to be happy.\" In fact, her outlook on life was shaped by the trip. \"I wanted the storms. I wanted the calms. I wanted to feel loneliness,\" she told The New York Times. \"And now I know all these things.

{"answer": 1, "choices": ["encourage us to try to concentrate", "teach us how to concentrate while studying", "give us the reasons for a lack of concentration", "list the benefits we can get from concentration"], "question": "\"I can't concentrate.\" \"My mind wanders when I try to study.\" Lack of concentration is one of the most common complaints heard at school. We all have the ability to concentrate. Think of the times when you were attracted to a super novel or the times when you were playing your guitar or piano. But at other times your mind races from one thing to another. Here are some tips. Rest from time to time. Remember to take short breaks. Lectures are usually 50 minutes long, and that's about the length of time most people can direct their attention to one task. But that's just an average. Your concentration time might be shorter (20-35 minutes) or longer (perhaps 90 minutes).When you take a break, you get more oxygen to your brain! When we sit for long periods, blood tends to be pooled in our lower body and legs. Get up and walk around the room for a couple of minutes. As a result, more oxygen is carried to the brain and you can concentrate better.  _ If you study one subject for a long time, you may find it hard to concentrate. Many students improve their concentration by changing one subject to another every one to two hours. In this way you can pay more attention to something that's different. Reward yourself. Give yourself a reward when you've completed a task. The task might be small, such as staying with a difficult paper until you've finished. But giving yourself a reward can help you be more interested in doing other tasks. Increase your activity level. Your concentration wanders more easily if you just read an article straight through. Instead, take the heading for each part and turn it into a question. For this part, that would be, \"How can I increase my activity level while studying?\" Then study that part to answer that question. Do this routinely. The questions give us a focus for each part and increase our involvement . The writer wrote the passage to  _  .", "subject": ""}

I tried to convey my understanding and appreciation without complimenting or talking down to him. I was really amazed by how that turned out. We hadn't had a conversation like that for over a year!

It could go on sale to the public from Friday, September 19. Apple has launched a new iPhone every year since it unveiled the range in 2007, selling more than 500 million units since then, and has traditionally launched key products in September. The iPhone 6, Apple's ninth iPhone model, is expected to be released in two different sizes:4.7-inches and 5.5-inches. The smaller of the two will be available first. Like iPhone5, the new model will come in silver , gold and space grey. The iPhone 6 will be powered by new operating system iOS 8. Through iOS8, users will be able to monitor  their health and fitness via HealthKit. HealthKit puts together numerous healthcare and fitness apps, such as blood pressure and heart rate monitors through partners including Nike, and allows them to communicate with each other. Users will be able to control home appliances and other connected devices through HomeKit, Apple's connected home framework. Similar to HealthKit, this app will organize your smart devices to control them in one place. One method of control will be via Siri-for example, you could tell Siri you were \"going to bed\", and it could dim the lights, lock your doors, close the garage door and set the room temperature. With the introduction of both of these key features, it's likely the iPhone 6 will take on even more of a lifestyle device role. It is designed to organize our lives and make everyday tasks easier and more efficiently completed. Suppliers are believed to be preparing to produce up to 80m of the new handsets by the end of December, according to the Wall Street Journal. In July, Apple announced strong financial results for its third quarter, with significant sales growth in China and profits ahead of expectations at $7.7bn.

The researchers said they don't know for sure what exactly may explain the relationship between early exposure to animals and a reduced risk of asthma.\"It might be due to a single factor, or more likely, a combination of several factors related to a dog ownership lifestyle or dog owners' attitudes, such as kids' exposure to household dirt and pet dust, time spent outdoors or being physically active,\"Fall told LiveScience.\"As a parent in a dog-and-baby household, it is nearly impossible to keep everything clean, and maybe this is a good thing for your baby's future health.\" Currently, one of the main hypotheses that aim to explain the link between a lower risk of asthma and early exposure to pets is that\"kids in animal environments breathe air that contains more bacteria and bacterial fragments, which actually could lower their risk of asthma,\"she said. Previous research on having pets and the risk of asthma in kids has mixed results. For example, the results of a 2001 review of previous studies suggested that exposure to pets was linked to an increased risk of asthma in children. But a 2012 review suggested that exposure to pets, especially dogs, was tied to a decreased risk of asthma and allergies  in childhood. \"My take-home message from this study is that parents at this point do not need to worry about keeping their dog when expecting a baby for fear of asthmatic disease,\"Fall said.\"I do want to be clear that this recommendation is valid only for families without a child already having allergies.

Dear editor, I'd like to express my opinion about grades. Students should be allowed to study without worrying about grades. Fortunately, most educators are becoming aware of the fact that students have different interests and abilities. I understand that grades are useful, but grades often limit creativity. Competing for better grades causes many students to turn down opportunities to pursue music, dramatics and sports. Grades force an arbitrary  standard of success on everyone. I do not demand as some extremists do, that grades be removed immediately. However, I do believe that less emphasis should be placed on grades. I hope that someday grades will become optional at Village High School.  Magdalena Smith Drama Club    Dear editor, I'd like to say something about grades. Let's face the facts about grades. Grades perform three basic functions. First, grades motivate  students to work at their highest level of competence . Second, they act as a reward for hardworking students and as a punishment to students who do not work hard. Finally, grades are used as an effective standard by which to measure students' achievement. Good grades help students to get jobs and to get into university. I've spoken with a number of students who have jobs, and most of them say that they were hired primarily on the basis of their grades.

Because of the bad weather they stayed indoors reading horror stories. On night, Byron asked everyone to write their own story. Mary thought of her dream and wrote the story ofFrankenstein Frankensteinwas published when Mary was 21, and became a huge success. Many people didn't think a 19-year-old woman could write so well and believed her husband was the real writer. Although famous, Shelley's life was full of sadness. Only one of her four children lived and in 1822 her husband died in a swimming accident. Mary was broken-hearted and decided not to marry again. She devoted herself to her child and continued to write until her death in 1851. How old was Mary Shelley when she died?", "subject": ""}

The shops are very crowded as the sales reached the boiling-point, with more than half a million people gathering on London's West End. Famous sales include the biggest, most popular shops such as Harrods, Selfridges, Liberty and John Lewis. Department stores are always a good bet -- you're likely to find everything you need under one roof, including much-needed food and drinks! It's a good time to stock up on cheap small tools, and there's no better time to invest in some designer clothes. Some people are taking their partners shopping with them, and buying their Christmas presents in the sale----a practical but unromantic way of making sure you get the gift you really want. For a less exciting but less stressful shopping experience, online sellers are also getting in on the act with January sales of their own. The most organized of all are those who are already doing their present shopping for next Christmas, in the January sales! What is the best title for this passage?", "subject": ""}

My heart felt peaceful, my mind was clear, and my soul was full of love. Even with all its problem: life seemed good. Then the music stopped and the news came on. There was talk of another famous millionaire in drug rehab   after an incident with the police. There was news on the murder of a poor man whose life was supposed to be changed after winning the lottery. There was even a discussion on how much greed and excess   had damaged our world. Every story seemed to point once again to the old saying that money can't buy happiness. Hearing them made me think of a movie I saw many years ago on Mother Teresa's home for the dying in India. What struck me most when I watched it wasn't the unbearable poverty there. It wasn't the sickness and suffering that the people there were going through. It was rather the peaceful smiles of love, kindness, and happiness that they shared with the Sisters and with each other.. These people had nothing. Many were struggling at the end of death. Yet, they knew the simple truth that so many of us here are still learning: Joy is Free. We can have joy and spread joy everyday of our life here. Don't love or admire dollar signs and think that money will bring you happiness then. Joy can't be purchased. It can't be owned. It can only be chosen and then given freely to others.

{"answer": 2, "choices": ["Business.", "Culture.", "Life.", "Entertainment."], "question": "I was driving down the road the other day, listening to sweet music coming out of my car radio. My heart felt peaceful, my mind was clear, and my soul was full of love. Even with all its problem: life seemed good. Then the music stopped and the news came on. There was talk of another famous millionaire in drug rehab   after an incident with the police. There was news on the murder of a poor man whose life was supposed to be changed after winning the lottery. There was even a discussion on how much greed and excess   had damaged our world. Every story seemed to point once again to the old saying that money can't buy happiness. Hearing them made me think of a movie I saw many years ago on Mother Teresa's home for the dying in India. What struck me most when I watched it wasn't the unbearable poverty there. It wasn't the sickness and suffering that the people there were going through. It was rather the peaceful smiles of love, kindness, and happiness that they shared with the Sisters and with each other.. These people had nothing. Many were struggling at the end of death. Yet, they knew the simple truth that so many of us here are still learning: Joy is Free. We can have joy and spread joy everyday of our life here. Don't love or admire dollar signs and think that money will bring you happiness then. Joy can't be purchased. It can't be owned. It can only be chosen and then given freely to others. In the eyes of eternity   money is only worthless paper. The only thing that matters is the love within you and the love that you give to the world. Make that your legacy   and your life will forever be rich in joy. Which section of a newspaper is this passage most probably taken from?", "subject": ""}

I exercise all the time, but I still have gut fat that hangs over my belt when I sit. Why isn't all the exercise getting rid of it? It's a question many of us could ask. More than 45 million Americans now belong to a health club, up from 23 million in 1993. We spend some $19 billion a year on gym memberships. Of course, some people join and never go. Still, as one major study -- the Minnesota Heart Survey -- found, more of us at least say we exercise regularly. And yet obesity   figures have risen sharply in the same period: a third of Americans are obese, and another third count as overweight by the Federal Government's definition. Yes, it's entirely possible that those of us who regularly go to the gym would weigh even more if we exercised less. But like many other people, I get hungry after I exercise, so I often eat more on the days I work out than on the days I don't. Could exercise actually be keeping me from losing weight? The popular belief that exercise is essential for weight control is actually fairly new. As recently as the 1960s, doctors routinely advised against too much exercise, particularly for older adults who could injure themselves.

The basic problem is that while it's true that exercise burns calories and that you must burn calories to lose weight, exercise has another effect: it can make one hungry.

EQ (Emotional Quotient) tells you how well you use your smartness. Professor Salovery, the psychologist who created the term, EQ, says that it is IQ that gets you hired but it is EQ that gets you promoted. Supported by his research, he suggested that when predicting future successes, a person's brainpower, as measured by IQ tests, might actually matter less than a person's character, or EQ. Professor Salovery may be correct. For example, have you ever wondered why some of the best and smartest students in your class end up failing exams? Perhaps it is because of their EQ. People often make the mistake of thinking that EQ is the opposite of IQ. It is not. Although it is hoped that people have both high EQs and IQs, there is little doubt that those with low EQs have a hard time surviving in life. For a long time, researchers discussed if a person's IQ could be raised. The geneticists said no, while the social scientists said yes. Furthermore, the social scientists said that it was possible to improve a person's EQ, particularly in terms of \"people skills\", such as understanding and communication. Recently, a professor released the findings of a study on senior high school students. When some normal students were introduced to some disabled students, they found that afterwards they were more willing to help people in difficulties. At the same time, there was a marked change in the disabled students' attitudes. They became more positive about their disabilities and were more eager to try new things. People with high EQs often have positive attitudes towards life and are open to different ideas, so they tend to be more creative in their thinking.

They help to build America's first transcontinental railroad between 1863 and 1869, connecting the East Coast with the West. People know little about the Chinese railroad workers and what happened to them after the project was finished. Stanford University in California wants to learn more about the lives of these men by reaching out to their families. Bill Yee's ancestors came from southern China. He said, \"My great-great-grandfather came to America during the'gold rush'days and he returned to China as a wealthy man. And then my great-grandfather came to work on the railroad and died there.\" But that did not stop his grandfather from coming to the US on false papers. He operated a laundry. Bill Yee's father continued to run the business and has never returned to China. \"Things were pretty bad in some parts of China in the 1860's. They came to America at all costs in order that they no longer had to bear hunger,\" Bill Yee said.

Within the space of a month, two of the greatest were born: Johann Sebastian Bach and George Frideric Handel. Handel's father was a barber and surgeon, which sounds like a strange combination today, but back then those occupations went hand in hand. Even though Handel was very interested in music, his father didn't think that was a good way to earn a living, so he wanted his son to be a lawyer. The story goes that Handel _ a quiet piano into the house so that he could practice in secret. One day, Handel went along when his father went to shave a duke. While his father was working, Handel sat down and played the duke's organ. The duke was so impressed that he convinced Handel's father to let his son study music, and Handel finally got to learn how to compose. Handel soon discovered that what he liked most was opera. In fact, he was so passionate about opera that he even fought a duel   over it with one of his friends. Since Italy was the place to learn about opera composing, Handel went off to Italy to study. When he got home, he got a job as court composer for a German prince. Having landed such a wonderful job, Handel immediately asked his boss for time off. He wanted to go to England, where he'd heard that there weren't nearly enough composers to satisfy the British taste for Italian opera. After great success writing opera in London, Handel came back to Germany. Then fate played a funny trick on Handel and his boss. The Queen of England died, and it just so happened that the prince Handel worked for was next in line to the British throne. When he arrived in London as King George, followed Handel, his court composer in Germany. In addition to serving the King, Handel became one of the most successful opera composers of his time. And he also produced them and traveled all over Europe to hire the best singers. There are stories of battles with rival opera producers and of fights between rival singers.

The birds moved rapidly on long skinny legs. Their feathers were brown and black. Their tails were seven inches long. Roadrunners use the tail for balance when running. That day, the roadrunners performed a courtship dance. They ran in wild circles. Suddenly, one stopped and stood still, its round eyes full of light. The second bird took hold of a small stick off the ground and presented it to the first, a gift serving as a symbol of their partnership. I returned to the spot each day, leaving bits of boiled chicken hoping they would return. Roadrunners eat snakes, lizards, mice, beetles, and spiders. Food is in short supply in the desert, so my offerings were welcome. The pair grew used to me. Soon after the pair finished building their nest six white eggs appeared in the nest bowl. In about three weeks, six roadrunner chicks, skin as black as coal, cried for food. Their parents brought food such as fence lizards and stink bugs. They fed their young until they were a month and a half old. Early one morning, a coyote came around, nose to the ground, for fresh bird meat.

The birds moved rapidly on long skinny legs. Their feathers were brown and black. Their tails were seven inches long. Roadrunners use the tail for balance when running. That day, the roadrunners performed a courtship dance. They ran in wild circles. Suddenly, one stopped and stood still, its round eyes full of light. The second bird took hold of a small stick off the ground and presented it to the first, a gift serving as a symbol of their partnership. I returned to the spot each day, leaving bits of boiled chicken hoping they would return. Roadrunners eat snakes, lizards, mice, beetles, and spiders. Food is in short supply in the desert, so my offerings were welcome. The pair grew used to me. Soon after the pair finished building their nest six white eggs appeared in the nest bowl. In about three weeks, six roadrunner chicks, skin as black as coal, cried for food. Their parents brought food such as fence lizards and stink bugs. They fed their young until they were a month and a half old. Early one morning, a coyote came around, nose to the ground, for fresh bird meat. The roadrunners fearlessly drove the coyote away, but it was soon back. After three attacks the coyote went away for good, tail between its legs. I stopped watching the nest when the little roadrunners, at two months of age, were ready to live on their own. It was hard to break away from \"my roadrunner family.\" Whenever I see a roadrunner now, rushing over the ground, I say hello to it as an old friend.

What was really exciting about the flight was the fact that the engine did not have to be altered in any way for the biofuel to work While this is a great initial step in trying to reduce CO2(carbon-dioxide)emissions from airplanes. there are a lot of hurdles  that still need to be overcome. First and foremost, unlike the normal fuel used to run airplanes (known as Jet A),biofuel freezes at high altitudes. Also, Jet'A'fuel burns consistently (at the same pace),which means it provides a safe and reliable fuel for long flights--engineers are not sure if biofuel will be able to do the same. The biggest hurdle to a full biofuel switch is our ability to be able to grow enough crops that can be converted to biofuel. There are two concerns that scientists have in this matter - the first is that the land to grow the extra crops will come from clearing more of our forests and the second is that since it competes with what we eat, the price of food will go up. However, Richard Branson of Virgin Airlines, envisions that if biofuel starts to replace oil on a greater basis, it will be manufactured from algae produced in sewage treatment plants, not from food sources.

But some Berliners are beginning a campaign, collecting petition   signatures and arguing that he's a tourist draw and a symbol as important as the Brandenburg Gate. \"He means a lot to many people. When you're with him you forget your problems,\" Hartmut Wiedenroth, co-founder of the campaign, told Spiegel Online. Knut became an international celebrity in 2007, drawing huge crowds to his cage and _ sales of thousands of Knut toys and Knut-shaped candies. The Vancouver-based Canadian Tourism Commission made Knut a major part of its \"Canada--Keep Exploring\" campaign to draw tourists to the country-- and especially to polar bear country in northern Manitoba to see them in their natural habitat. Environmentalists also used the bear to promote the fight against global warming. But Knut's popularity diminished as his size increased to 210 kilograms, He was photographed at one point snapping   at a child near his cage. In September his keeper, Thomas Doerflein, died of a heart attack. Doerflein, who became a celebrity himself after nursing the tiny ball of white fur when Knut's mother rejected him, had been re-assigned shortly after Knut's first birthday. Some animal rights critics said Knut has been showing unusually aggressive behavior because of his unnatural upbringing. What would be the best title for the passage?", "subject": ""}

One January, I officiated  at two funerals for two elderly women. Both died a natural death. At the first home, the son of the deceased  woman said, \"If only I had sent my mother to Florida and gotten her out of this cold and snow, she would be alive today. It's my fault that she died.\" At the second home, the son said, \"If only I had not insisted her going to Florida, she would be alive today. That long airplane ride was more than she could take. It is my fault.\" When things don't turn out as we would like them to, we tend to assume that had we done things differently, the story would have had a happier ending. Any time there is a death, the survivors will feel guilty. Because the course of action they took turned out bad, they believe that the opposite course, for example, keeping mother at home, would have turned out better. After all, how could it have turned out any worse? There seem to be elements involved in our readiness to feel guilty. The first lies in our belief that the world makes sense----there is a reason for everything that happens. The second is the thought that we are the cause of what happens, especially the bad things that happen. The roots of this feeling may lie in our childhood. A baby comes to think that the world exists to meet his needs, and that he makes everything happen in it. He wakes up in the morning and calls the rest of the world to its tasks. He cries, and someone comes to attend to him. When he is hungry, people feed him, and when he is wet, people change him.

Among the world's most widely watched sporting events, the World Cup makes the world turn around a moving ball. Many businesses, including banks and shops in some countries, change their hours according to the games so that people don't miss any of the action. But why is this sporting event so popular? Soccer can be played by anybody almost anywhere, without too much and expensive equipment. The universal attraction of the sport is down to being simple, according to Kevin Alavy from a sports research organization. FIFA , which has organized the World Cup since 1930, has helped make the event more popular. FIFA makes a habit of taking the World Cup to many new markets, such as South Korea and Japan in 2002 and South Africa in 2010. This has expanded the sport's reach beyond Europe and South America, according to CNN. Brazil is seen by many as the home of soccer, so it is a bit surprising that this is just the second time that the World Cup is held in the country after the fourth one was held there back in 1950. Soccer writer Jonsthan Wilson believes that the challenge of achieving success at the World Cup has also increased its magical attraction. Although FIFA has more than 200 member states --- it's an organization with more members than the United Nations --- only eight countries have ever won the competition. These countries are Brazil (five wins), Italy and Germany (four each); Uruguay and Argentina (twice each); and England, France and Spain (once each). The 2014 World Cup has seen different teams compete in 12 different cities, more than any other Cup on record. Spreading from south to north, some cities have different scenes, which surely make the World Cup more inspiring. We can learn from the passage that FIFA   _  .", "subject": ""}

Many businesses, including banks and shops in some countries, change their hours according to the games so that people don't miss any of the action. But why is this sporting event so popular? Soccer can be played by anybody almost anywhere, without too much and expensive equipment. The universal attraction of the sport is down to being simple, according to Kevin Alavy from a sports research organization. FIFA , which has organized the World Cup since 1930, has helped make the event more popular. FIFA makes a habit of taking the World Cup to many new markets, such as South Korea and Japan in 2002 and South Africa in 2010. This has expanded the sport's reach beyond Europe and South America, according to CNN. Brazil is seen by many as the home of soccer, so it is a bit surprising that this is just the second time that the World Cup is held in the country after the fourth one was held there back in 1950. Soccer writer Jonsthan Wilson believes that the challenge of achieving success at the World Cup has also increased its magical attraction. Although FIFA has more than 200 member states --- it's an organization with more members than the United Nations --- only eight countries have ever won the competition. These countries are Brazil (five wins), Italy and Germany (four each); Uruguay and Argentina (twice each); and England, France and Spain (once each). The 2014 World Cup has seen different teams compete in 12 different cities, more than any other Cup on record. Spreading from south to north, some cities have different scenes, which surely make the World Cup more inspiring. In which year did Brazil host the World Cup for the first time?", "subject": ""}

{"answer": 3, "choices": ["most people in society", "some people in society", "few people in society", "everyone in society"], "question": "We often use the words \"growth\" and \"development\" as if they meant basically the same thing. But this may not always be the case. One can easily imagine instances in which a country has achieved higher levels of income (growth) with little or no benefit coming to most of its citizens (development). In the past, most development policies were aimed at increasing the growth rate of income per capita . Many are still based on the theory that benefit of economic growth will come to all members of society. If this theory is correct, growth should encourage development. By the early 1970s, however, the relationship between growth and development was being questioned. A major study by the World Bank in 1974 concluded that it is now clear that more than decades of rapid growth in developing countries has been of little benefit to a third of their population. The World Bank study showed that increase in GNP per capita did not promise important improvements in such development indicators as nutrition, health, and education. Although GNP per capita did indeed rise, its benefit came down to only a small part of the population. This realization gives rise to a call for new development policies. These new policies favor agriculture over industry, call for national redistribution of income and wealth, and encourage programs to satisfy such basic needs as food and shelter. In the late 1970s and early 1980s the international macroeconomic crises of high oil prices, worldwide recession and the third world debt, forced attention away from programs designed to get rid of poverty. However, the lesson remains: economic growth does not promise economic development. Efforts may be required to change growing output capacity into economic benefit that reaches most of a nation's people.

A major study by the World Bank in 1974 concluded that it is now clear that more than decades of rapid growth in developing countries has been of little benefit to a third of their population. The World Bank study showed that increase in GNP per capita did not promise important improvements in such development indicators as nutrition, health, and education. Although GNP per capita did indeed rise, its benefit came down to only a small part of the population. This realization gives rise to a call for new development policies. These new policies favor agriculture over industry, call for national redistribution of income and wealth, and encourage programs to satisfy such basic needs as food and shelter. In the late 1970s and early 1980s the international macroeconomic crises of high oil prices, worldwide recession and the third world debt, forced attention away from programs designed to get rid of poverty. However, the lesson remains: economic growth does not promise economic development. Efforts may be required to change growing output capacity into economic benefit that reaches most of a nation's people. According tothe study by the World Bank in 1974, economic growth in some backward countries brought   _  .", "subject": ""}

Mountain air contains less oxygen than air at lower altitudes, so breathing it causes the heart to beat faster and the body to burn more energy. A handful of studies have found that athletes training at high altitudes tend to lose weight. Doctor Florian Lippl of the University Hospital Of Ludwig-Maximilians-university Munich wondered how the mountain air would affect overweight individuals if they weren't doing any more physical activity than usual. Lippl and his colleagues invited 20 overweight men to an environmental research station about 300 meters below the summit of Zugspitze, a mountain around 2,970 meters near the Austrian border. They were allowed to eat as much as they liked. The men also gave blood so that researchers could test for hormones linked to appetite and fatness. At the end of the week, the men, whose mean weight starting out was 105kg, had lost on average about l.5kg. The men's blood pressure also dropped, which the researchers believed was due to weight lost. Exactly what caused the weight loss is uncertain. Loss of appetite is common at higher altitudes, and indeed the men ate significantly less than usual--about 700 calories fewer per day.

Everyone needs to take time to exercise. There are lots of ways to improve your health without having to join a gym. Here are some tips on how to better make use of your free time while staying healthy.      By keeping physically active, you're making sure that your joints   and body organs   are kept in good working order. Exercise can also help keep your weight at a healthy level and can protect you against catching coughs and colds. Other benefits are an increase in your energy level and brain activity. Knowing that you're looking and feeling good can also increase your self-confidence.     If you're under 18, you should try to do a total of 60 minutes of physical exercise every day. This includes anything from taking the lift at the gym to walking up stairs. If you're over 18, it's at least 30 minutes of exercise at least five days a week.     Getting fit isn't all about gyms - some forms of exercise won't cost you any money, and most forms can easily be used in your busy lifestyle without having to find some special time in your day. For example, riding a bike to school, college or work, and even running on a playground a few times a week can improve your fitness level.

Some of this advice is going to be just wrong. Myth 1: Sleeping late on the weekends will make up for lost sleep during the week. Fact: Getting less than the amount of sleep that you need night after night accumulates over time and starts to create a \"sleep debt\". And like all debts, eventually you need to pay the price. The problem with waiting until the weekend to meet sleep needs is that in the meantime, you are paying the price of being less alert, feeling more moody, thinking slower and having less stimulation. Myth 2: A boring teacher (or warm room, full stomach, etc.) can put teens to sleep. Fact: If you are getting enough sleep on a regular basis, there is no teacher, math book or reading assignment in the world boring enough to make you fall asleep in class. There are basically two things that make people sleepy -- not getting enough sleep and not getting good quality sleep. The environment kids are in, including the room temperature, light level and entertainment value, may unmask underlying sleepiness, but the environment does not cause it! So if you are dozing off in class, don't blame it on bad teaching.  Myth 3: Teenagers can pull an all-nighter to study and still be ready for the big test in the morning. Fact: Teenagers are much better off studying less and getting a good night's sleep. Research clearly shows that the ability to concentrate and learn new information, as well as to work efficiently, declines sharply after being awake for 15-16 hours, and continues to bottom out the longer you stay up.

A nickname can also be a descriptive name for a person, place or thing. Many American cities have nicknames. These can help establish an identity, spread pride among citizens and build unity. Nicknames can also be funny. Los Angeles, California is the second largest city in population, after New York City. Los Angeles has several nicknames. One is simply the city's initials, L.A. It is also called the City of Angels because Los Angeles means \"the angels\" in Spanish. Los Angeles often has warm, sunny weather. So another nickname is City of Flowers and Sunshine. New York is called The Big Apple. So Los Angeles is sometimes called The Big Orange because of the fruit that grows in that city's warm climate. The American motion picture and television industries are based in Los Angeles. So it is not surprising that it is called The Entertainment Capital of the World. Many films are made in the area of Los Angeles called Hollywood. Millions of people visit the area. Many movie stars live in Los Angeles. The city is sometimes called Tinseltown. This nickname comes from the shiny, bright and often unreal nature of Hollywood and the movie industry. Another nickname for Los Angeles is La-La Land, using the first letters of Los and Angeles. This means a place that is fun and not serious, and maybe even out of touch with reality. The city of Los Angeles is part of Los Angeles County. There are many smaller cities in the county. Beverly Hills, with its rich people, is one of them. So is Pasadena, with its Rose Parade each New Year's Day. So are the coastal cities of Santa Monica and Malibu, where people like to ride surfboards on the Pacific Ocean waves.

A research team from UCLA (University of California at Los Angeles) has designed a four-step plan to improve your memory in just 14 days. \"It sounds like another advertisement, but it really works,\" says UCLA psychiatry   professor Gary Small. The team found the four-step plan improved memory function   in teenagers under stress and older people. After a two-week study that included brain-teasers  , exercise and diet changes, test subjects' memories worked more efficiently. Here's the programme: Memory training: Train yourself with brain-teasers, crossword puzzles and memory exercises that train verbal   skills throughout the day. Healthy diet: Eat five rather than three meals a day. The food should be rich in omega-3 fats (omega-3), such as whole grains and vegetables that contain antioxidants  . Having frequent meals helps increase blood glucose  , the primary energy source for the brain. Physical fitness: Have regular physical exercise such as walking, basketball or running, every day. Stress reduction  : Perform stretching and relaxation exercises. Stress causes the body to release a chemical that can shrink   the memory centres in the brain. Before-and-after brain scans showed that test subjects experienced on average a 5 per cent increase in working memory. This suggests they were using their brains more efficiently. They also performed better on a cognitive   test.

The right blanket can warm your bones but the wrong one can affect your sleep. I asked experts for advice on picking the perfect blanket for a good night's sleep. Here's what they told me. When it comes to sleep temperature, experts recommend following the principle: not too cold, not too hot, but just right. \"People seem to sleep best at temperature between 62 and 70 degrees F,\" says Dr. Alice Hoagland. When the surrounding temperature falls too low, it can _ you from sleep. A good blanket helps drive the coldness away. At the other extreme, overheating yourself can affect your sleep as well. \"Core body temperature typically drops during the first four hour's of sleep,\" says Dr. Hoagland. This decline in body temperature helps you fall asleep and stay asleep. \"In medical care, weighted blankets are one of our most powerful tools for helping people who are anxious, upset, and possibly losing control,\" says Dr. Karen Moore. These special blankets are filled with weighted pellets. Weighted blankets are also marketed for general use as an aid to sleep and relaxation. Like a firm hug, weighted blankets help us feel safe.\" This is the reason why many people like to sleep under a blanket even in summer. \"If you want to try this type of blanket, the best weight depends on your body size and personal preference. However, 15 to 30 pounds is typical for adults,\" Moor says. She adds that weighted blankets are not recommended for those recovering from surgery. \"People can also have serious preferences for a particular blanket,\" says Dr. Hoagland. \"Regularly using a favorite blanket for sleep can help to develop a conditioned response so that sleep is quicker.\" In fact, many sleep centers ask patients to bring their own blanket and pillow from home, which helps them fall asleep more easily.

The clergyman, a huge man with a booming  voice, sat the younger boy down and asked him strictly, \"where is God?\" The boy's mouth dropped open but he made no answer, sitting there with his mouth hanging open, wide-eyed. So the clergyman repeated the question in an even stricter tone  \"where is God?\" Again the boy made no attempt to answer. So the clergyman raised his voice even more and shook his finger in the boy's face and shouted \"where is God?\"  The boy screamed and escaped from the room, ran directly home and dove into his closet,  _ the door behind him. When his elder brother found him in the closet, he asked \"what happened?\" The younger brother replied out of breath, \"We are in big trouble this time. God is missing, and they think we did it.\" What do you suppose the boy felt when he was asked by the clergyman?", "subject": ""}

He works every day, but can only buy food, not anything else, even clothes. One day, Suhklal heard about a non-profit   organization called GOONJ. This organization does not give away free clothes or sell clothes for money. Instead, GOONJ asks people to work to help the community. In return, GOONJ supplies people with clothes. Suhklal said the experience made him happy. He felt proud of his work and his new clothes.    In 1998, Anshu Gupta and his wife wanted to help the people affected by a crisis  , so they gathered all the clothes they had not worn. Looking at their gathered clothing, they wanted to start a new clothing organization. But they wanted their organization to be different from others. They wanted to collect clothing all year round -- not just in times of crisis. And more importantly, they wanted to serve people in a way that made them feel proud when receiving clothes.   GOONJ makes sure the clothing is given to people who can use it. For example, people in areas with cooler temperatures receive warmer clothes. And people in villages that wear traditional clothing would receive traditional clothing. GOONJ also reuses clothes that people can't wear. For example, a shirt with holes can be made into a bag or used to make a blanket.   GOONJ helps organize projects that improve the community. People receive clothes in return for their community work. Gupta believes this helps the receivers build self-respect, because they have earned the clothes. It also helps the receivers to be proud of what they have done to help their community.    Since it began, GOONJ has expanded its work. GOONJ also collects more than just clothes. It collects home or school supplies. GOONJ also started a program that helps protect women's health. What may be the best title of the text?", "subject": ""}

With the help of Max Egan, we went to film them near Byron Bay. It was extremely exciting to spot the little puffs of spray on the horizon. When migrating, the whales can be traveling at speeds of about 12km/h and can dive under anywhere between five and forty minutes, but with many years of experience Max usually guided our boat to exactly the right place to provide us with amazing sighting. As the whales break the surface like submarines , the water spills off their broad dark backs and huge tails. Then, with a powerful down stroke, they dive back into the depths of the sea, leaving just a smooth glassy patch of water or \"footprint\" on the surface to show where they had been. One day we had traveled up and down the shore and far out to the sea in search of whales, but the horizon was deserted. There was no report of whales in the area so we decided to test out Max's new, highly sensitive hydrophone and the result was astonishing. As soon as the hydrophone was in the water, we found ourselves listening to the most beautiful  voices. What may have seemed like a vast empty ocean was filled with the singing of whales.

As the whales break the surface like submarines , the water spills off their broad dark backs and huge tails. Then, with a powerful down stroke, they dive back into the depths of the sea, leaving just a smooth glassy patch of water or \"footprint\" on the surface to show where they had been. One day we had traveled up and down the shore and far out to the sea in search of whales, but the horizon was deserted. There was no report of whales in the area so we decided to test out Max's new, highly sensitive hydrophone and the result was astonishing.

But there's a _ to that growth, one that's evident - or sometimes less than evident - in the smoggy, smelly skies above cities like Beijing, New Delhi and Jakarta. Thanks to new cars and power plants, air pollution is bad and getting worse in much of the world, and it's taking a major toll (,) on global health. How big? According to a new analysis published in the Lancet, more than 3.2 million people suffered deaths from air pollution in 2010, the largest number on record. That's up from 800,000 in 2000. And it's a regional problem: 65% of those deaths occurred in Asia, where the air is choked by diesel soot   from cars and trucks, as well as the song from power plants and the dust from endless urban construction. In East Asia and China, 1.2 million people died, as well as another 712,000 in South Asia, including India. For the first time ever, air pollution is on the world's top - 10 list of killers, and it's moving up the ranks faster than any other factor. So how can air pollution be so damaging? It is the very finest soot - so small that it roots deep within the lungs and then enters the bloodstream - that contributes to most of the public - health toll of air pollution including death. Diesel soot, which can also cause cancer, is a major problem because it is concentrated in cities along transportation zones affecting overpopulated areas. It is thought to contribute to half the deaths from air pollution in urban centers. Fro example, 1 in 6 people in the U.S. live near a diesel - pollution hot spot like a rail yard, port terminal or freeway. We also know that air pollution may be linked to other non - deadly diseases. Fortunately in the U.S. and other developed nations, urban air is for the most part cleaner than it was 30 or 40 years ago, thanks to regulations and new technologies like the catalytic converters   that reduce automobile emissions. Govemments are also pushing to make air cleaner - see the White House's move last week to further tighten soot standards. It's not perfect, but we've had much more success dealing with air pollution than climate change. Will developing nations like India eventually catch up? Hopefully - though the problem may get worse before it gets better. The good news is that it doesn't take a major technological advance to improve urban air. Switching from diesel fuel to unleaded   helps, as do newer and cleaner cars which are less likely to send out pollutants. Power plants - even ones that burn mineral fuels like coal - can be fitted with pollution - control equipment that, at a price, will greatly reduce smog and other pollutants. But the best solutions may involve urban design. In the Guardian, John Vidal notes that Delhi now has 200 cars per 1,000 people, far more than much richer Asian cities like Hong Kong and Singapore. Developing cities will almost certainly see an increase in car ownership as residents become wealthier - and that doesn't have to mean deadly air pollution.

The future of hitchhiking most likely lies with car-sharing organized over the Internet, via sites such as hitchhikers. org. But for now, you can still stick your thumb out(actually, I didn't do much of that, preferring just to hold up my destination sign) and people-wonderful, caring, sharing, unafraid people-will stop. In the UK, with its cheap coaches and reasonable rail service, I don't think I'll make a habit of it. But having enjoyed it so much, I'm ready now to do a big trip across Europe and beyond.

Practice after practice, he eagerly gave everything he had. But being half the size of the other boys,he got  ly nowhere. Despite his hard training at all the games, this hopeful athlete sat on the bench and hardly ever played. This teenager lived alone with his father, and the relationship between the two of them was very special. Even though the son was always on the bench, his father was always in the stands cheering. He never missed a game. This young man was still the smallest of the class when he entered high school. But his father continued to encourage him. The young man loved football and was determined to try his best at every practice, and perhaps he'd get to play when he became a senior. All through high school he never missed a practice nor a game but remained a benchwarmer. Besides, his faithful father was always in the stands, always with words of encouragement for him. When the young man went to college, he decided to try out for the football team as a\"walk-on\". Everyone firmly believed that he could never make the cut, but he did. The news that he had survived the cut thrilled him so much that he rushed to the nearest phone and called his father. His father shared his excitement and was sent season tickets for all the college games. This persistent young athlete never missed practice during his four years at college, butactually he never got the real chance to play in a game. It was at the end of his senior football season that the coach met him with a telegram. The young man read the telegram and he became totally silent. Swallowing hard, he mumbled to the coach,\"My father died this morning. Is it all right if I miss practice today?\"The coach put his arm gently around his shoulder and said,\"Take the rest of the week off, son. And don't even plan to come back to the game on Saturday.\" Saturday arrived, and the game was not going well. In the third quarter, when the team was ten points behind, a silent young man quietly slipped into the empty locker room and put on his football gear. As he ran onto the sidelines , the coach and his players were surprised to see their faithful teammate back so soon.\"Coach, please let me play. I've just got to play today,\"said the young man. The coach pretended not to hear him. There was no way he wanted his worst player in this close play-off game. But the young man insisted, and finally feeling sorry for the kid, the coach gave in.\"All right,\"he said.\"You can go in.\"Before long, the coach, the players and everyone in the stands could not believe their eyes. This little unknown, who had never played before, was doing everything right. The opposing team could not stop him. He ran, passed, blocked, and tackled like a star. His team began to succeed. The score was soon tied. In the closing seconds of the game, this kid got a pass and ran all the way for the winning touchdown. Finally, after the stands had emptied, the coach noticed that this young man was sitting quietly in the corner all alone. The coach came to him and said,\"Kid, you were unbelievably fantastic!

If it sounds odd that Angola would be the most expensive, Mercer's Barb Marder explains that\"Despite being one of Africa's major oil producers, Angola is a  ly poor country yet expensive for expatriates   since imported goods can be dear. In addition, finding secure living accommodations that meet the standards of expatriates can be challenging and quite costly.\"The survey found similar supply issues in N'Djamena, Chad, the other top 10 city in Africa.

For example, although Tokyo is Asia's most expensive city for people who live in a foreign country, the weakening of the Japanese yen against the dollar makes it seem cheaper than it was a year ago.

Stand and Deliver (1988) Few people can inspire us more than a good teacher. Jaime Escalante (Edward James Olmos got Oscar nomination for best actor) is a great one. Employed at a high school where kids are expected to fail, Escalante challenges his math students to struggle for better things, like getting good grades in the AP exam. Despite the obstacles in their lives, the classmates accomplish their goals, thanks to Mr. Escalante's support. The real Jaime Escalante, the Best Teacher in America, says that Stand and Deliver is \" 90% truth, 10% drama.\" What do the four movies have in common?", "subject": ""}

It might be because we are stuck in a traffic jam or stuck behind a very slow driver. It might be because we think another driver has done something very stupid and dangerous. Whatever the reason, it seems that getting angry in a car is something which happens more and more often and there is now a special term for it \"road rage\". Some experts even think that road rage is a kind of mental illness! How can we recognize this \"illness\" of road rage? There are two kinds of road rage: aggressive driving and aggressive reactions to the way other people are driving. Aggressive driving can take different forms: *Driving much faster than the speed limit. *Increasing your speed very quickly. *Driving very close behind the car in front and sounding the horn or flashing the headlights. *Changing lanes very suddenly and blocking another car. *Moving into a parking space where another car is trying to park. There are also different reactions to the way other people are driving. These include: *Making rude signs at people. *Shouting at people and threatening them. *Deliberately driving into another person's car. *Hitting somebody. *Using a weapon such as a baseball bat, or even a gun or a knife. Road rage is certainly not a joke. There have been incidents of road rage which have led to serious injuries and even murder. Experts think that one reason for road rage is that films show a lot of examples of fast and aggressive driving such as car chases where this kind of driving seems to be positive. Experts also think that the punishments for dangerous driving are not serious enough. Experience shows that driving problems can be controlled, but it takes a long time. In the UK in the last 30 years, the police have been quite successful in reducing the number of people who drink and drive. They are now working to stop people using mobile phones when they are driving. Let's hope they can have the same success with the road rage.

In the first stage, the newcomers like their new environment. Then, when the fresh experience dies, they begin to hate the city, the country, the people, and everything else. In the last stage, the newcomers adapt to their surroundings and finally enjoy their life there. Culture shock arises from many obvious factors. The weather may be unpleasant. The customs may be different. The public service systems such as the telephone, post office, or transportation may be difficult to work out. Even the simplest things become headaches. Still worse, the language may be difficult. Who feels culture shock? Everyone does in this way or that. But culture shock surprises most people. Very often the people having the worst culture shock are those who never had any difficulties in their home countries and were successful in their community.

Birds give a lot of care to their young, while crocodiles just help their young to the water. The discovered fossils of dinosaurs sitting on their eggs and staying with their young suggest the parents were taking care of their babies, but we still cannot say that all dinosaurs did the same. There is still a long way to go before the above questions could be answered. Dinosaur scientists, will have to find more proof to reach an agreement. Dinosaur scientists can probably know whether dinosaurs were good parents by  _  .", "subject": ""}

The more we try to save time, the less time we seem to have. In every area of our lives we are doing things faster. And many of us live in towns and cities which are getting noisier and more stressful as each day passes. But now a worldwide movement, whose aim is to slow life down, has started. Its supporters are people who believe that a happier and healthier way of life is possible. The Slow Food movement was founded the day that an Italian journalist, Carlo Petrini, saw that McDonald's had opened a restaurant in a beautiful square in Rome. He thought it was sad that many people today live too quickly to sit down for a proper meal and only eat much fast food. He decided that he had to try to do something about it and so he started the Slow Food movement. Slow Food has become a global organization ever since and now has more than 80,000 members in 100 countries. Slow Food also encourages people to eat local and regional food, to use local shops and markets, to eat out in small family restaurants, and to cook with traditional recipes. The idea of Slow Cities was inspired by the Slow Food movement. The aim of Slow Cities is to improve people's quality of life. Towns which want to become a Slow City have to reduce traffic and noise, increase the number of green areas, plant trees, build pedestrian zones, and promote local businesses and traditions. Now it has spread to other countries all over the world, from the UK to Japan and Australia. There are now 135 Slow Cities in 24 countries across the world that have been named since founding of the organization in 1999. Gao Chun County, in east China's Jiangsu Province, is expected to be named the first \"Slow City\" in China next year. \"Slow Cities are about having a community life in the town,\" said a local resident. \"It is not 'slow' as in 'stupid'.

My idea of a university was that it was a center of cultural life, a resource for the entire community. In all my twenty-one years, it had never occurred to me that a school would have a wall around it.

How'd he get that in here? You wonder. Then you remember how much you paid for your snacks. What invites the unwelcome outside food is probably the price. Why pay $ 5 for a bag of M&Ms when you can get them for a dollar at the corner store? Earlier this year, a Michigan man decided to fight for his right to snack. Joshua Thompson is using his local theater after it banned outside food. He argues the ban breaks a Michigan law that prevents businesses from charging extremely high prices. However, most legal experts believe Thompson has little chance of winning his case, though he does have a point: 85 cents out of a dollar of treats a movie theater sells is pure profit . The truth is that movie theaters are more in the snack business than the movie business. A huge part of the ticket income goes to the Hollywood studio. This makes sense, since the studios have to pay the costs of movie production and advertising. But that often doesn't leave much cash for the theater, which also has its own running costs. If customers stopped buying food, owners would have to raise ticket prices even higher. Of course, there's another reason to think twice before bringing food into the movies: It's against the rules.

In response to the spread of English and the increased multi-language trends arising from immigration, many countries have introduced language laws in the laws in the last decade. In some, the use of languages other than the national language is banned in public spaces such as advertising posters. One of the first such legal provisions was the 1994 \"Toubon law\" in France, but the idea has been copied in many countries since then. Such efforts to govern language use are often dismissed as _ by language experts, who are well aware of the difficulty in controlling fashions in speech and know from research that language switching among bilinguals is a natural process. It is especially difficult for native speakers of English to understand the desire to maintain the \"purity\" of a language by law. Since the time of Shakespeare, English has continually absorbed foreign words into its own language. English is one of the most mixed and rapidly changing languages in the world, but there has not been a barrier to acquiring prestige and power. Another reason for the failure of many native English speakers to understand the role of state regulation is that it has never been the Anglo-Saxon way of doing things. English has never had a state-controlled authority for the language, similar, for example, to the Academic Francaise in France.

Called the City of Water, Venice was built about 1,500 years ago. It's made up of 118 tiny islands in the Adriatic Sea. The area, however, may be in over its head. But now scientists have a new plan to save the city. Because the city was built on soft soil, it has been sinking under the pressure of its own weight. Scientists estimate that Venice sinks at a rate of nearly 2 inches every 100 years. Rising sea levels could make Venice go under even faster, some experts say. Earth's temperature is slowly increasing. That is causing sea ice to melt, which makes the world's waters rise, they say. To keep the city afloat, experts want to pump about 40 billion gallons of sea water beneath Venice. The liquid would expand the sand under the city, which would help support the islands, explains lead scientist Giuseppe Gambolati. Experts are rushing to save Venice because of its rich history. The city was once a strong sea power. \"Many famous artists and opera singers have come from Venice.

He proposed that pain is a purely physical phenomenon - that tissue injury makes specific nerves send a signal to the brain, causing the mind to notice pain. The phenomenon, he said, is like pulling on a rope to ring a bell in the brain. It is hard to overstate how deeply fixed this account has become. In medicine, doctors see pain in Descartes' terms-- as a physical process, a sign of tissue injury. The limitations of this explanation, however, have been apparent for some time, since people with obvious injuries sometimes report feeling no pain at all. Later, researchers proposed that Descartes' model be replaced with what they called the gate control theory of pain. They argued that before pain signals reach the brain, they must first go through a gating mechanism in the spinal cord . In some cases, this imaginary gate could simply stop pain signals from getting to the brain. Their most _ suggestion was that what controlled the gate was not just signals from sensory nerves but also emotions and other \"output\" from the brain. They were saying that pulling on the rope need not make the bell ring. The bell itself--the mind-- could stop it. This theory led to a great deal of research into how such factors as mood, gender, and beliefs influence the experience of pain. In a British study, for example, researchers measured pain threshold and tolerance levels in 53 ballet dancers and 53 university students by using a common measurement: after immersing your hand in body-temperature water for two minutes to establish a baseline condition, you put your hand in a bowl of ice water and start a clock running. You mark the time when it begins to hurt: that is your pain threshold. Then you mark the time when it hurts too much to keep your hand in the water: that is your pain tolerance. The test is always stopped at 120 seconds, to prevent injury. The results were striking. On average female students reported pain at 16 seconds and pulled their hands out of the ice water at 37 seconds. Female dancers were almost three times as long on both counts. Men in both groups had a higher threshold and tolerance for pain, but the difference between male dancers and male nondancers was nearly as large. What explains that difference? Probably it has something to do with the psychology of ballet dancers--a group known for self-discipline, physical fitness, and competitiveness, as well as by a high rate of chronic  injury. Their driven personalities and competitive culture evidently accustom them to pain. Other studies along these lines have shown that outgoing people have greater pain tolerance and that, with training, one can reduce one's sensitivity to pain. There is also striking evidence that very simple kinds of mental suggestion can have powerful effects on pain. In one study of 500 patients undergoing dental procedures, those who were given a placebo  injection and promised that it would relieve their pain had the least discomfort-- not only less than the patients who got a placebo and were told nothing but also less than the patients who got actual drug without any promise that it would work. Today it is abundantly evident that the brain is actively involved in the experience of pain and is no more bell on a string. Today every medical textbook teaches the gate control theory as fact. There's a problem with it, though. It explains people who have injuries but feel no pain, but it doesn't explain the reverse, which is far more common-- the millions of people who experience chronic pain, such as back pain, with no signs of injury whatsoever.

On those rainy summer days, I had nothing fun to do and could only sit inside, staring out at the rain like a bird in a cage. I was an only child, so there was no one else to play with. My father worked from home, so I was not truly alone, but he could not actively play with me since he was at work. It was those days that I would watch whatever was on television or read any books that I could find lying around. I'd drag through the day and pray each night that the rain would not be there the next day. As an adult, though, my opinion of summer rain has changed. When you have to work every day, summer is not as exciting. Everything seems dull. Such a mindset makes you cheer for anything new or different. I spend the winter dreaming of summer and the summer dreaming of winter. When summer comes, I hate how hot it is. And then I look forward to the rain, because the rain brings with it a cold front, which makes me comfortable. Rainy days are still the worst days of the summer, but summer rain today means positively beautiful -- and considerably cooler -- weather tomorrow. As an adult, the author views summer rain differently because   _  .", "subject": ""}

When I talked to my neighbor later, she said that the damage had been too much and that the entire tree would have to be cut down. Thankfully she had saved a few saplings  from it that she hoped to replant in the future. Still, it was a shock to drive by her house the other day and see nothing but a stump in her front yard. I missed that tree. I missed its beauty, its leaves shinning in the afternoon sun. I missed seeing its limbs reach towards the heavens. I thought that the stump would be a sad reminder of its loss for a long time to come. My wonderful neighbor, though, had another plan.

Tyler was believed to have been texting a friend when he stepped onto a high-traffic road against the green light and was struck by the truck. Then he was sent to a Hamilton hospital. Surgery was performed to ease the pressure in his brain, but .the family was told he would not recover. \"With all of his injuries, I just prayed all night for a miracle. And I was granted a miracle, but not in the way I'd expected,\" says LeBlanc, her voice choked by emotion. The family decided to donate Tyler's organs, a choice she believes her kind and considerate son would have made on his own. It's also a choice that transplant programs wish would be made more often, because the need for donor organs is far more than the supply worldwide. More than 1,500 people in Ontario are on the waiting list for life-saving organs, and one dies every day because an organ has not become available in time. Across Canada, the gap between donations and the need for organs continues to widen. At the end of 2010, more than 4,400 Canadians were on the waiting list for donor organs, including 3,362 needing a kidney. That year, 229 died before the organs they needed became available. LeBlanc recalls the morning when her son was taken off life support and his organs were removed. Despite living what she calls a parent's absolute worst nightmare, LeBlanc says she has got the strength to bear such an unbearable loss. \"He's still there. He's still living.

In the late 1940s the World Health Organization challenged this physically and medically oriented   view of health. They stated that health is a complete state of physical, mental and social well-being and is not merely the absence of disease (WHO, 1946). Health and the person were seen more holistically (mind / body / spirit) and not just in physical terms.

Creating health meant providing not only medical health care, but also health promotion programs and policies which would help people maintain healthy behaviours and lifestyles.

{"answer": 1, "choices": ["a white day", "a black day", "a red day", "a green day"], "question": "Every people has its own way of saying things, its own special expressions. Many everyday American expressions are on colors. Red is a hot color. Americans often use it to express heat. They may say they are red hot about something unfair. When they are red hot they are very angry about something. The small hot tasting peppers found in many Mexican foods are called red hots for their color and their fiery taste. Fast loud music is popular with many people. They may say the music is red hot, especially the kind called Dixieland jazz. Pink is a lighter kind of red. People sometimes say they are in the pick when they are in good health. The expression was first used in America at the beginning of the twentieth century. It probably comes from the fact that many babies are born with a nice pink color that shows that they are in good health. Blue is a cool color. The traditional blues music in the United States is the opposite of red hot music. Blues is slow, sad and soulful. Duke Ellington and his orchestra recorded a famous song - Mood Indigo - about the deep blue color, indigo. In the words of the song: \"You ain't been blue till you've had that Mood Indigo.\" Someone who is blue is very sad. The color green is natural for trees and grass. But it is an unnatural color for humans. A person who has a sick feeling stomach may say she feels a little green. A passenger on a boat who is feeling very sick from high waves may look very green. Sometimes a person may be upset because he does not have something as nice as a friend has, like a fast new car. That person may say he is green with envy. Some people are green with envy because a friend has more dollars or greenbacks. Dollars are called greenbacks because that is the color of the back side of the paper money. The color black is used often in expressions. People describe a day in which everything goes wrong as a black day. The date of a major tragedy is remembered as a black day.

Fast loud music is popular with many people. They may say the music is red hot, especially the kind called Dixieland jazz. Pink is a lighter kind of red. People sometimes say they are in the pick when they are in good health. The expression was first used in America at the beginning of the twentieth century. It probably comes from the fact that many babies are born with a nice pink color that shows that they are in good health. Blue is a cool color. The traditional blues music in the United States is the opposite of red hot music. Blues is slow, sad and soulful. Duke Ellington and his orchestra recorded a famous song - Mood Indigo - about the deep blue color, indigo. In the words of the song: \"You ain't been blue till you've had that Mood Indigo.\" Someone who is blue is very sad. The color green is natural for trees and grass. But it is an unnatural color for humans. A person who has a sick feeling stomach may say she feels a little green. A passenger on a boat who is feeling very sick from high waves may look very green. Sometimes a person may be upset because he does not have something as nice as a friend has, like a fast new car. That person may say he is green with envy. Some people are green with envy because a friend has more dollars or greenbacks. Dollars are called greenbacks because that is the color of the back side of the paper money. The color black is used often in expressions. People describe a day in which everything goes wrong as a black day. The date of a major tragedy is remembered as a black day. A blacklist is illegal now. But at one time, some businesses refused to employ people who were on a blacklist for belonging to unpopular organizations.

The answer is simple: when in a boarding school you stay there instead of going home. This is something everyone knows. But what not everyone knows is that when you are in a boarding school, you make a lot of friends. You live together with your friends for a few years, which makes the friendship even more _ . You are a lot closer to your teachers and other workers in your school. It most feels like you are in one big happy family. If boarding students have any problems, they can always go to one of the teachers or one of the workers, and they will be glad to be able to help. Life in a girl boarding school or a boy boarding school differs a lot from life in a mixed one. Studies have shown that the social life and academic  results from students in a single sex boarding school are much better than those of a mixed one. One of the reasons for this is that with less pressure in the classes, the children can concentrate  much better when they are in separated classes. Life in boarding schools for troubled teens differs from that of all the other boarding schools. Life in these schools is often much stricter because of the rules the students have to obey. These schools have strict rules to teach troubled teens respect. Although some boarding schools have some different rules and different ways of teaching, life in schools is almost the same. Students attend classes, eat together, and sleep in dorms where they normally have to share their room with some other students.

Tayka Hotel de Sal Where: Tahua, Bolivia How much: About $95 a night Zxxk Why it's cool: You've stayed at hotels made of brick or wood, but salt? That's something few can claim. Tayka Hotel de Sal is made totally of salt - including the beds (though you'll sleep on regular mattresses and blankets). The hotel sits on the Salar de Uyuni, a prehistoric dried-up lake, which is the world's biggest salt flat. Builders use the salt from the 4,633-square-mile flat to make the bricks, and glue them together with a paste of wet salt that hardens when it dries. When there is big rain, the owners just mix up more salt paste to strengthen the bricks. Green Magic Nature Resort Where: Vythiri, India How much: About $240 a night Why it's cool: Taking a pulley -operated lift 86 feet to your treetop room is just the start of your adventure.

Later you might test your fear of heights by crossing the handmade rope bridge to the main part of the hotel, or just sit on your bamboo bed and read. You don't even have to come down for breakfast - the hotel will send it up on the pulley-drawn \"elevator\".

Although you have a full private bathroom in your quarters, there is also a toilet in the 12-foot-tall fire hydrant outside. Gamirasu Cave Hotel Where: Ayvali, Turkey How much: Between $130 and $475 a night Why it's cool: This is caveman cool! Experience what it was like 5,000 years ago, when people lived in these mountain caves formed by volcanic ash. But your stay will be much more modern.

Dalla-Camina had a sense that she wasn't alone. Her new study now proves it. The Australian native polled 1,000 American working women aged 18 to 55 and the results are discouraging.

After graduating from college with degrees in chemistry and microbiology, she went to work at Gulf South Research Institute in Louisiana. As part of her job, she conducted field research on toxic (poisonous) substances in the environment, often in minority communities located near large industrial polluters. She found many families were being exposed to high, sometimes deadly levels of chemicals and other toxic substances. But she was not allowed to make her information public. Frustrated by these restrictions, Subra left her job in 1981, created her own company and has devoted the past two decades to helping people fight back against giant industrial polluters. She works with families and community groups to conduct environmental tests, interpret test results, and organize for change. Because of her efforts, dozens of toxic sites across the country have been cleaned up. And one chemical industry spokesperson calls her \"a _ top _ gun\" for the environmental movement. How has Subra achieved all this? Partly through her scientific training.Partly through her commitment to environmental justice. But just as important is her ability to communicate with people through public speaking. \"Public speaking,\" she says, \"is the primary vehicle I use for reaching people.\" If you had asked Subra before 1981 \"Do you see yourself as a major public speaker?\", she would have laughed at the idea. Yet today she gives more than one hundred presentations a year.

The experiment would be done by astronauts on the space shuttle. Ted had always been interested in space and flight. Insect flight especially interested him. Ted noticed that insects need gravity to take off and land. They need gravity to fly in a straight line. But in space, there is no gravity. Could insects fly in zero gravity? That is what Ted wanted to find out. Ted made an experiment called \"Insect in Flight Motion Study\". He entered his experiment and soon news came that _ . A large team of scientists and engineers helped Ted get his experiment ready to fly. There were many questions to be answered first. What kind of insects would Ted use in his experiment? The insects would have to be strong enough to live on the shuttle for nine days without much food. What kind of container would hold the insects? Would the insects die during the shuttle flight? After months of hard work, the \"insectronauts\" were chosen. A group of moths, flies, and honeybees were put into a special box and put onto the space shuttle. When Columbia flew into space, it was carrying insect passengers. On March 24, astronauts Gordon Fullerton and Jack Lousma took out the box that held the insects. They began filming the insects with a special video camera. When the space shuttle landed Ted was able to watch the video film of insects. Just as he thought, most of the insects did have trouble flying in zero gravity. The flies did well. But the moths' flight seemed \"uncontrolled\". They would often just hang in the air.

{"answer": 1, "choices": ["How Does the Brain work?", "Why Can't I Tickle Myself?", "The importance of Prediction", "The Importance of Our Brains"], "question": "It's puzzling, isn't it? No matter where you try to tickle yourself, even on the soles  of your feet or under your arms, you just can't. To understand why, you need to know more about how your brain works. One of its main tasks is to try to make good guesses about what's going to happen next. While you're busy getting on with your life, walking downstairs or eating your breakfast, parts of your brain are always trying to predict the future. Remember when you first learned how to ride a bicycle? At first, it took a lot of concentration to keep the handlebars steady and push the pedals . But after a while, cycling became easy. Now you're not aware of the movements you make to keep the bike going. From experience, your brain knows exactly what to expect so your body rides the bike automatically. Your brain is predicting all the movements you need to make. You only have to think consciously about cycling if something changes---like if there's a strong wind or you get a flat tyre. When something unexpected happens like this, your brain is forced to change its predictions about what will happen next. If it does its job well, you'll adjust to the strong wind, leaning your body so you don't fall. Why is it so important for our brains to predict what will happen next? It helps us make fewer mistakes and can even save our lives. For example, when a chief fireman sees a fire, he immediately makes decisions about how best to position his men. His past experiences help him foresee what might happen and choose the best plan for fighting the fire. His brain can instantly predict how different plans would work out, and he can _ any bad or dangerous plans without putting his men at risk in real life. So how does all this answer your question about tickling? Because your brain is always predicting your own actions, and how your body will feel as a result, you cannot tickle yourself. Other people can tickle you because they can surprise you. You can't predict what their tickling actions will be. What is the best title for this passage?", "subject": ""}

This is suggested by the results of new research on mice. While other studies have shown the harmful effects of polluted air in the lungs and heart, this is the first to show the negative effect on the brain. The team of Laura Fonken, Randy Nelson , from the Ohio State University, the USA, has spread to the brain a previous line of research which found that fine particulate  matter floating in the air mainly because of air pollution caused by humans, causes swelling in much of the body, and may be related to high blood pressure problems, and some other diseases. In the research Fonken and his colleagues exposed mice to polluted air for six hours each day, five days a week, over a period of 10 months, almost half the average life length of mice. Polluted air contains fine particles created by cars, factories and natural dust. Fine particles of this kind are tiny, about 2.5 micrometers in diameter , or about one-thirtieth the width of a human hair. These particles can go deep into lungs and other organs. The concentration of this particulate material to which they exposed mice is equal to the concentration at which people can be exposed in some polluted urban areas. After a period of 10 months, the researchers got the animals to have a series of behavioral tests. Both the behavior of mice and the results of neurological   tests done to them show that those within the polluted air had more problems in learning and memory, and higher levels of anxiety.

This is a good idea since it is useful for so many different things. When you consider its speed and convenience, you will understand that there isn't any reason to use any other means to complete everyday jobs.     Just consider the convenience factor when you need quick simple information. Looking for a movie can take just minutes by jumping online as opposed to going and getting a newspaper and then hoping it has the theater that interests you. It is also a great way to find a restaurant for the evening. From the online yellow pages to the various websites of different eateries , there are many different choices of spots to gather information. Find old friends from school by joining in one of the endless groups that have been created to put people together.     Information is just so easy to get when you are using the Web. Find out how to build a pond yourself in your own backyard or garden by a quick search. Then shop for materials and fish as well. Shopping on the Internet also saves time and we can select a better product without having to travel a long distance. Using the Internet, shoppers can go through the product's prices from various stores while sitting in one place.     Studying for school of any kind is easier when you can use the Web to find information. Now you can search an online dictionary that anyone can use at no cost. Doing research is easy, since there are lots of sites devoted to helping students of any type get their work completed.     Businesses also have a huge existence on the Web. A company might only have a simple website to give directions and its location. There are many of us who now depend on the Web. If a business does not have some type of website, then it will not be found by those who search the Web for local businesses. What is the main idea of the passage?", "subject": ""}

It is an electronic revolution, made possible by the marriage of television and computer technologies. The word 'television', coming from its Greek ( tele: distant) and Latin ( vision: sight) roots, can literally be interpreted as sight from a distance. , it works in this way: through an advanced system of electronics, television provides the capability of changing an image ( focused on a special photoconductive plate within a camera ) into electronic impulses, which can be sent through a wire or cable. These impulses, when fed into a receiver (television set), can then be electronically reorganized into that same image. Television is more than just an electronics system, however. It is a means of expression, as well as a tool for communication, and as such becomes a powerful tool for reaching other human beings. The field of television can be divided into two categories determined by its means of transmission(,). First, there is broadcast television, which reaches the masses through airwave transmission of television signals. Second, there is nonbroadcast television, which provides for the needs of individuals or specific interest groups through controlled transmission techniques.

In fact, they move much more quickly than they should according to their size and the laws of physics. Scientists do not completely understand why the speed of these stars is so high.

Neither albino   nor polar bear, the spirit bear is a white variant   of the North American black bear, and it's found almost exclusively here in the Great Bear Rainforest. At 25,000 square miles ---- one and a half times as big as Switzerland--the region is a spooky , wild, mysterious place: there are wolves here that fish. Deer that swim. Western red cedar trees that have stood a thousand years. And a black bear that is white. Scientists know how black bears are born white. They're just not sure why. The phenomenon, known as Kermodism, is caused by a recessive mutation   at the MC1R gene, the same gene associated with red hair and fair skin in humans. To be born white, a bear must inherit the mutation from both parents. The parents themselves don't have to be white. They just need to carry the recessive mutation. So it's not uncommon for white bears to be born to black parents. White fur happens in only one of every 40 to 100 black bears on the British Columbia mainland coast, but the feature is especially distinct on certain islands in the Great Bear Rainforest. For example, on Princess Royal Island, one in ten black bears is white, and on Gribbell Island, directly north of Princess Royal, it's one in three. It's unclear how the feature arose. One theory was the \"glacial bear\" hypothesis   that the spirit bear represented a remaining adaptation from the last great ice age, which ended here 11,000 years ago.

The original hamburger can be traded back to the Middle Ages, when Russians ate raw meat that was scraped   and shredded  with a dull knife and formed into patties  , It was called Tartar steak. This was the first step in a long series of developments that eventually resulted in hamburger as we know it today.    German sailors picked up the raw meat delicacy   in their contacts with Russians and brought it back to their home port of Hamburg. But the people there were unused to eating raw meat , so they broiled   the outside of the Russian steak; thus the hamburger steak was born.    The hamburger steak was brought ot America in the nineteenth century immigrants. Louis Lasssen, a cook in New Haven, Connecticut, modified  the hamburger steak by sandwiching it between two pieces of  bread. But the true American hamburger came into existence in St. Louis at the Louisiana Purchase Exposition in 1904. A harried cook at the fair quickly slapped broiled beef patties between buns and served them to a demanding crowd, which gulped them down joyously.  At first this new food creation was made from scraps of poorer cuts of meat that were not used for anything else, but before scrapes were not enough.

Initially as the Chinese e-co mmerce group as a platform for its users to manage extra funds in their online payment accounts, Yu'E Bao is becoming something far more powerful: a straight-up substitute for traditional bank deposits  .\"There's no point in keeping money in the bank any more. This is just as reliable, more flexible and you can earn a lot more from it,\" Mr Li says. A quick hit of the Yu'E Bao application on his phone shows the Shanghai-based editor has earned more interest on his account over the past  day than 94 per cent of other local users .\"This is fun, almost like a computer game,\" he says with a laugh. For every Rmb12 that companies and individuals have deposited in Chinese banks since June, they placed roughly Rmb1 in their Yu'E Bao accounts, according to Financial Times calculations based on official data. While it remains tiny compared with total deposits in the Chinese banking system, this transfer of cash from banks to the Alibaba platform is only speeding up. In the process, it threatens to upend( ) the rules of China's state-protected financial department, break banks' profit model and shifting power to savers in a way that was scarcely imaginable at the start of this year. Other Chinese tech companies are getting in on the act. Tencent, developer of the hugely popular messaging app WeChat, is said to be designing a fund platform similar to Yu'E Bao. Baidu, the search engine company, began marketing investment products in October. \"Internet companies, with their ability to instantly reach millions of consumers, have already started to change the competitive dynamic in finance,\" says Ernan Cui, an analyst with GK Dragonomics, a Beijing-based research firm. What's the writer's attitude towards the e-commerce gr oup as a platform for its users to manage payment accounts?", "subject": ""}

Well, did you ever stop to consider what a red light is?

It's only an automatic  stop signal. And it does not mean that there is cross traffic. Did you see any cross traffic during our trip? Of course not. I slowed down at the light, looked carefully to the right and to the left. Not another car on the street at this hour. Well, then! What would you have me do?

In the 1950s women contributed just 20 percent of household income. That rose to about 40 percent in the 1990s and then reached 50 percent last year. In a recent study of Chinese consumer behavior, McKinsey found that women tend to shop more frequently than men, and spend more on personal-care products and food.

It was about the same price and I figured I would plant it in my yard and maybe get a few meals worth out of it before it died. Little did I know that the little $4 basil plant would survive for almost 3 years and provide enough fresh basil for at least 2-3 meals per month (that's about 60 basil-filled meals)! What I learned was that the plant likes quite a bit of sun and warm temperatures (it went nearly into rest in the winter when temperatures in Arizona drop to below zero overnight). My husband and I had enjoyed so many meals with fresh basil that after the original one died, we immediately got another basil plant to replace it. If you like to cook, you know that basil fresh off the plant transforms a good meal into an amazing one. To make the case for always keeping a basil plant in our yard even stronger, I just opened the latest issue of All You magazine and saw this picture of a beautiful basil plant. Then I read the first sentence of the accompanying article, \"Did you know a basil plant can produce nearly $80 worth of leaves each year?\" I knew that I had gotten my money's worth from the little plant, but I had no idea that I saved about $200 in the time I had that plant. $4 to produce $200?

The report said the company was still in the red, but was able to cut its loss from the year before.    A profit by a business is written in black numbers. So a company that is \"in the black\" is making money.      Another financial expression is \"run on the bank.\" That is what happens when many people try to withdraw all their money from a bank. A \"run on the bank\" usually happens when people believe there is danger a bank may fail or close.    Newspaper reports about a banking crisis in Russia used that expression. They said the government acted because of fears that the crisis would cause a run on the banks.      \"Day trading\" is a system that lets investors trade directly on an electronic market system.
