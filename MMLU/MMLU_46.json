{"answer": 1, "choices": ["3.", "4.", "5.", "6."], "question": "I'm Rich Kleinfeldt with some financial expressions used in business and the stock market. Our first expression is \"in the red.\"  It is another way of saying that a business is losing money. In the past, numbers in the financial records of a company were written in red ink to show a loss.    A business magazine recently published a report about a television company. The report said the company was still in the red, but was able to cut its loss from the year before.    A profit by a business is written in black numbers. So a company that is \"in the black\" is making money.      Another financial expression is \"run on the bank.\" That is what happens when many people try to withdraw all their money from a bank. A \"run on the bank\" usually happens when people believe there is danger a bank may fail or close.    Newspaper reports about a banking crisis in Russia used that expression. They said the government acted because of fears that the crisis would cause a run on the banks.      \"Day trading\" is a system that lets investors trade directly on an electronic market system. It was the first completely computerized stock market. It sells stocks of companies not listed on any stock exchange. Many high technology companies are listed on it.    Day trading companies provide a desk and a computer system to an investor who wants to trade. Individuals must provide fifty thousand dollars or more to the trading company to pay for the stocks they buy. Thousands of other investors do day trading from computers in their homes. A day trader watches stock prices carefully. When he sees a stock rise in price, he uses the computer to buy shares of the stock. If the stock continues to rise in price in the next few minutes, the day trader sells the shares quickly to make a small profit. Then he looks for another stock to buy. If a stock goes down instead of up, he sells it and accepts the loss.    The idea is to make a small profit many times during the day. Day traders may buy and sell stocks hundreds of times each day. How many financial expressions are explained in the passage?", "subject": ""}

When I started reading your novel, I saw how Melody was a smart and talented girl.

To better understand the reasons, the PISA team, starting with four countries in 2006, and then adding 14 more in 2009, went to the parents of 5,000 students. They interviewed them about how they raised their kids and then compared it with the test results for each of those years.

Although the benefits of computers are real, they have disadvantages, too. Kids can lose their way, wasting hours on mindless software of violent games. Just as parents have always helped children make good choices about everything from friends to food, books to TV, now we must make sure they get the best out of computers. What effects do computers have on family life?", "subject": ""}

It will not be easy for you to make a mark, unless you are different. Reading the works of great travel writers and getting inspired by them are not a bad thing, but you should not copy their style and their approach. The world needs something new. Greatness is not achieved through following, it is achieved through leading, and to lead you need to choose your own approach! Being a travel writer can be exacting. You must realize that you will not be the first one in a long line. Flights will not arrive on time for you, every hotel will not have a room for you, and you may not be able to make a living out of your work. So, you should be prepared mentally and physically before you begin your quest  to explore the world.  When you write a travel guide, you should remember that you are not the subject in your guide! You should always focus on the place that you are exploring. What is the difference between visiting a place and exploring it? The answer is very simple, when you visit a place you ask the question 'where to go?' and when you explore, you ask 'why to go there?' Your work should not turn out to be just a map which shows directions. It should explain why you chose a specific direction. If you are not curious while traveling, you will never have something new for your readers. I believe that every individual has a unique style of writing. You should dare to have a different approach. Avoid long personal stories and do not neglect grammar and punctuation.  You should also take efforts to promote your work. You should make use of blogs, and popular social networking sites to promote your work. Try to establish contact with major publications. Once your work gets published in a big magazine, there is no stopping. There are many travel writers who say that this is the best job in the world. If you love traveling, you will love this job!

Someone --- specifically the father-daughter team of Larry and Meagan Johnson --- has figured out that on some American job sites, five generations are working side by side. In their new book about generations in the workplace the pair argue that while such an age difference adds a lot of texture and a variety of life experiences, it can also bring tensions and conflicts. The Johnsons are human-resource trainers and public speakers. Dad Larry is a former health-care executive; daughter Meagan is a onetime high-level sales manager. Here are the oldest and youngest of the five generations they identify: They call the oldest group Traditionals, born before 1945. They were heavily influenced by the lessons of the Great Depression and World War Two. They respect authority, set a high standard of workmanship, and communicate easily and confidently. But they're also stubbornly independent. They want their opinions heard. At the other extreme are what the Johnsons call Linksters, born after 1995 into today's more complicated, multi-media world. They live and breathe technology and are often social activists. You won't find many 15-year olds in the offices of large companies, except as volunteers, of course, but quite old and quite young workers do come together in sales environments like bike shops and ice-cream stores. The Johnsons, Larry and Meagan, represent a generation gap themselves in their work with jobsite issues. The Johnsons' point is that as the average lifespan continues to rise and retirement dates get delayed because of the tight economy, people of different generations are working side by side, more often bringing with them very different ideas about company loyalty and work values. The five generations are heavily influenced by quite different events, social trends, and the cultural phenomena of their times. Their experiences shape their behavior and make it difficult, sometimes, for managers to achieve a strong and efficient workplace.

At that time, the dancers were looked down on. So Martha's parents didn't approve of her desire to dance at the beginning. Until 1916, she began her studies at the newly created Denishawn School of Dancing and Related Arts, founded by Ruth St. Denis and Ted Shawn, where Graham worked very hard to improve her ability to dance because she was considered too old to begin dancing. In 1936, Graham made her defining work, \"Chronicle^, which signaled the beginning of a new era in modern dance. The dance brought serious issues to the stage for the general public in a dramatic manner. Influenced by the Wall Street Crash of 1929, the Great Depression that followed, and the Spanish Civil War, it focused on depression and isolation, reflected in the dark nature of both the set and costumes. Graham continued to dance past the age of seventy. Once again, she was met with criticism from people who came to watch her shows. But she didn't give up.

At church, I met my second husband, Dean. For more than 25 years, I bloomed in Foxboro, and I had another two children. Then, when Darcy was a few years out of college, she moved to Alameda, California, to be near friends. I missed her badly. A year later my beloved husband Dean had deadly cancer. He only made it eight months. My heart was broken. Later I moved to Alameda with my children. It was a beautiful Victorian island, and I was grateful to spend more time with Darcy.

While such tracking of cancer is a good thing in general, researchers are increasingly questioning whether all of this testing is necessary for the elderly. With the percentage of people over age 65 expected to nearly double by 2050, it s important to weigh the health benefits of screening against the risks and costs of routine testing. In many cases, screening can lead to additional examinations and operations to remove cancer, which can cause side effects, while the cancers themselves may be slow-growing and may not cause serious health problems in patients' remaining years. But the message that everyone must screen for cancer has become so ingrained   that when health care experts recommended that women under 50 and over 74 stop screening for breast cancer, it caused a noisy reaction among doctors, patients and social groups.

The 1st wife is in fact our soul, often neglected in our pursuit of material, wealth and sensual pleasure.  Guess what? It is actually the only thing that follows us wherever we go. Perhaps it's a good idea to cultivate and strengthen it now rather than to wait until we're on our deathbed to lament. What would serve as the best title for the passage?", "subject": ""}

{"answer": 3, "choices": ["The survival instinct.", "The civilized behavior.", "The leadership of the captain.", "The length of time."], "question": "Whether it is \"women and children first\" or \"every man for himself\" in a shipwreck  may depend on how long it takes the ship to sink, researchers said recently.    When the Lusitania was torpedoed  by a German ship in 1915, it sank in 18 minutes and the majority of the survivors were young men and women who responded immediately to their powerful survival instincts .    But when the Titanic struck an iceberg in 1912, it took \"three hours to go down, allowing time for more civilize  behavior to take control--and the majority of the survivors were women, children and people with young children.    Economist Benno Torgler of the Queensland University of Technology in Australia and his colleagues studied the two sinkings in order to explore the economic theory that people generally behave in a \"rational\"  and selfish manner. The two tragedies provided a \"natural experiment\" for testing the idea, because the passengers on the two ships were quite similar in terms of gender   and wealth.    The major difference was how long it took the ships to sink. They suggested that when people have little time to react, instincts may rule.

{"answer": 2, "choices": ["Chinese proverbs", "Chinese humour", "Chinese manners", "Chinese languages"], "question": "China is known as a state of manners and ceremony  . Many proverbs  have been passed down from generation to generation such as \"Polite behavior costs nothing\" or \"Showing respect demands reciprocity  \" and so on. For instance, there is an interesting short story. Once upon a time, a man went on a long tour to visit his friend with a swan  as a gift. But it escaped from the cage  on the way. Though he tried hard, he got hold of nothing but a feather . Instead of returning home, he continued his journey with the swan feather. When his friend received this unexpected gift, he was deeply moved. And the saying \"The gift is nothing much, but it's the thought that counts.\" was spread far and wide.         Chinese used to cup one hand in the other before the chest as a greeting. This tradition has a history of more than 2, 000 years and nowadays it is seldom used except in the Spring Festival. And shaking hands is more popular on some formal occasions. Bowing, as to show respect to the higher level, is often used by the lower like subordinates  , students, and attendants . But at present Chinese youngsters prefer to simply nod as a greeting. In a way, this development shows the ever-increasing pace of modern life.         It is common social practice to introduce the junior to the senior, or the familiar to the unfamiliar. When you start a talk with a stranger, the topics such as weather, food, or hobbies may be good choices to break the ice. For a man, a chat about current affairs , sports, stock market  or his job can usually go on smoothly. Similar to Western customs, you should be careful to ask a woman private questions. However, relaxing talks about her job or family life will never put you into danger. She is usually glad to offer you some advice on how to cook Chinese food or get used to local life. Things will be quite different when you've gotten to know them. Though Chinese are said to be implicit  , they are actually humorous enough to be pleased about the jokes of Americans.

This went on all day. Step, stab, scream. Over the next few days, I started limping  . My whole body hurt. Even my hair. I kept thinking that the little man would get tired of stabbing me and go pick on somebody else.We often take things for granted until we lose them or they start to hurt. My brother deals with pain every day. He's also blind and suffers from cerebral palsy  , needs a walker to walk, doesn't take much for granted. I had to wonder: What would he think about my foot? Finally, after a week of pain, I went to see a very nice foot doctor. The doctor studied my foot, took X-rays, shook his head, and said the little man's name: Arthur Itis, or Arthritis  . I knew it well. I'd often heard it hissed angrily by my grandparents and parents, all attacked by Arthur's ice pick when they got older. \"Wait,\" I said. \"Doesn't Arthur usually just pick on old people?\" The doctor smiled, looking at my chart. \"How old are you?\" I gave him a look. \"Never mind,\" I said. \"Can you fix it?\" \"Well,\" he said, \"we can try.\" He listed several options and I chose the injection  . It didn't hurt much. Not half as much as the ice pick. That was yesterday. This morning, I awoke, took a few careful steps and ... hallelujah!It hurt just a bit, but no ice pick. I looked under the bed. No sign of Arthur. Maybe he was hiding in the closet, waiting for another day.But for now, he was gone, and I was grateful.My mind began to race with plans to do all the things I'd been putting off for days:unpack, clean the house, wash my hair ... Then it hit me. Another stab. Not in my foot. In my heart. I remembered that I hadn't called my brother in a long time. It's easy to take some things for granted.

Just as a map of your town gives you a picture of where things are located, Gaia's map of the galaxy will tell astronomers where the stars are. Over five years, Gaia will observe   about a billion stars and other objects in our galaxy. Each object will be observed about 70 times. Gaia will be sent into space connected to a rocket. It contains two telescopes, each focused at a different angle  . These two telescopes act like Gaia's \"eyes\". The reason why humans can see things in 3D is that we have two eyes focused on the same object, at slightly different angles. By using two telescopes like eyes, Gaia can produce the first 3D map of the positions of the stars it views. Gaia, which is to be sent into space in 2011, will be a powerful telescope. If you were to use it on Earth, for example, you could stand 600 miles away from your best friends and still get a clear picture of their hair.

So one year I searched for something special to give Mike. The inspiration came in an unusual way. Our son Kevin was 12 and was on the school wrestling team. Shortly before Christmas, there was a non-league match against a team of poor kids. They were dressed in ragged sneakers, and presented a sharp contrast   to our boys in their golden uniforms and sparkling   new wrestling shoes. As the match began, I was alarmed to see that the other team was wrestling without helmets . Their team obviously could not afford them. We beat them hands down  . Mike shook his head sadly. \"I wish just one of them could have won,\" he said. Mike loved kids and enjoyed coaching football and baseball. That's when the idea for his present came. That afternoon, I went to a sports store and bought a load of wrestling headgear and shoes. I sent them anonymously   to the poor team. On Christmas Eve, I placed a small, white envelope on the tree, the note inside telling Mike what I had done and that this was his gift from me. Mike's smile was the brightest thing about Christmas that year. In the years that followed, I sent a group of mentally handicapped   youngsters to a hockey game, and a check to a pair of elderly brothers whose home had burned to the ground the week before Christmas.

Family Meals Family meals are comforting for both parents and kids. Children like to guess what they are going to have and parents get the chance to introduce new food to children and to find out which food they like and which ones they don't. Teens may turn up their noses at your plan of a family meal. It is not surprising because they're trying to establish independence. Yet studies find that teens still want their parents' advice, so use the mealtime as a chance to reconnect. Stocking up   on healthy food Kids, especially younger ones, will eat mostly what they can get at home. That's why it's important to control the supply lines -- the food which you serve for meals and have on hand for snacks. You should have enough fruits, vegetables, lean meat and other good sources of protein, such as eggs and nuts, and healthy snacks, such as yogurt, peanut butter and whole-grain biscuits. Being a good example The best way for you to encourage healthy eating is to eat well yourself. Kids will follow the lead of the adults they see every day. By eating fruits and vegetables and avoiding fast food and sugary drinks, you'll be sending the right message. No conflicts over food Parents might find themselves shouting at children to get them to have healthy food in front of them. This in fact can make children dislike what they are aske d to eat.

While there, it would be tested to see how it handles  the _ of space - the radiation, the station's movement and even how it stands up to the debris   flying around in orbit. The private Las Vegas company, founded by millionaire real estate mogul  Robert Bigelow, won a $17.8 million contract from NASA to provide the module to the space station. \"Today is the first step, but it's a big step,\" said Bigelow's George Zamka. Replace the space station or make it larger. It also hopes to build the habitats on the moon. Its B330 module would be even bigger, with 330 cubic meters of internal ( ) space. The modules could be connected. Creating research facilities, the company says, or even space hotels.

Lee Se-dol, one of the greatest Go players, has won 18 world championships for 21 years of his professional career. AlphaGo, a computer program developed by Google's DeepMind, beat the European Go champion, an achievement that was not expected for years in October, 2015. The match between Lee and AlphaGo was seen as a representative game between humans and Artificial Intelligence (AI). The match of the century drew great attention from news organizations, Go fans and the general public across the world as well as in South Korea. Go originated from China more than 2,500 years ago. It involves two players who take turns putting markers on a net-shaped board to gain more areas on it. One can occupy the markers of the rival   by surrounding the pieces of the other. Go is considered to be a lot more complex than chess where artificial intelligence scored its most famous victory to date when IBM's Deep Blue beat grandmaster Gary Kasparov in 1997. But experts say Go presents an entirely different challenge because of the game's incomputable number of move options. In other words, the computer must be capable of human-like \"intuition\"   to win. \"I was very surprised because I did not think that I would lose the game,\" said Mr. Lee.He said AlphaGo's early strategy was \"excellent\" and that he was shocked by one unconventional move it had made that a human never would have played, which he believed directly resulted in his loss. AlphaGo is proud of a deep learning capability to learn for itself and discover new strategies by playing games against itself and adjusting neural networks   based on a trial-and-error process known as reinforcement   learning. In spite of his loss, he did not regret accepting the challenge. \"I had a lot of fun playing Go and I'm looking forward to the future games,\" he said after AlphaGo won 3-0 in a five-game match. \"Playing against a machine is very different from an actual human player.

My husband and I had to smile. At least some good was coming out of the economic difficulty. We no longer needed a house. It was good to know that another young family would now be living in what had been a happy, loving home for us. Also, the house needed work that we no longer had the energy to perform. These may be tough times economically, but as for me, I intend to look forward, not back. As Shakespeare said in Macbeth, \"what's done is done and cannot be undone.\" It's the present and future that matter. We can learn from our mistakes and make our lives better.

In much of Africa, elephants are now put in national parks. Elephants suffered a serious and steady decrease in numbers in the 1970s. This was the same time when scientists were beginning to learn a great deal about elephants and their behavior. Studies through the 1980s and into the 1990s showed a lot about their sounds and methods of communication. In Kenya alone, in the 1970s and 1980s, the elephant population decreased from 170,000 to 25,000. The sharp drop in numbers was the result of poachers   illegally killing elephants for their ivory. The price of ivory went from $3 a pound to $50 to $100 a pound. Africa became very attractive to poachers. Bull elephants carried the largest tusks  , so they were more often killed. With males gone and older females killed by poachers as well, there were many young elephants unable to benefit from the wisdom of the older females and matriarchs, who lead the herds. Kenya took a stand, international trade in ivory was officially forbidden, and $3,000,000 worth of confiscated   ivory was burned in Kenya. The following year, only 50 elephants were lost to poachers in Kenya instead of 3,000. But Kenya has the fastest growing human population in the world. People throughout Africa won't tolerate elephants eating their crops and destroying their livelihoods. In South Africa, elephants live behind the fences of national parks.

So instead of spending their whole school day learning, Mathilda and her classmates start their day by spending two hours to the closest river fetching water ---water that is anyway most likely not safe to drink. They do the same thing again in the afternoon, so they often lose around half of their school day fetching water. Mathilda has to do the same thing outside of school hours to get the water her family needs at home, leaving her little time for studying. Because of rising temperatures, water has become harder and harder to find here, and people have to spend more and more time trying to find it. This is just one small example of how climate change is making it harder to realize people's rights to water, education and security.

Back experts in the USA were worried that young students are having back and neck problems because they are carrying too much in their backpacks (schoolbags). \"It hurts my back when I run,\" said Eglin Reyes, a student in Virginia. \"It's hard to get up the stairs with my backpack because it's too heavy.\" Students have to carry heavy backpacks on their backs for a whole week's study. Beeline is one of them. They have regular backpacks with two straps  to carry them, but a number of students with heavy loads have switched to rolling backpacks. The backpacks have wheels and can roll on the ground. Shirley Park's backpack weighs 10 kilos, and she said, \"I'll change to a rolling backpack because I am starting to have back pain.\" How much is too much? Experts say that students should carry no more than 10 to 15 percent of their own body weight. A few students have had a good idea to lighten the load: Less homework. Doctor's suggestions: *Lighten the load. Take home only the books the students need that night. *Wide straps are better. They can send out weight over your shoulders and be sure to wear backpacks with two straps. *The heaviest things should be packed closest to the back. *Bend  both knees when you pick up the pack, don't just bend the waist .

More and more people go online as wireless networks have brought the Internet closer and closer: it's on our mobile phones, in our cars and TV sets, in hospital surgery rooms and in fishing boats that battle the waves of the Atlantic. And this revolution has brought along with it a new way of shopping. Both big and small, e-commerce websites have literally flooded the Internet by the hundreds of thousands. Anything you can buy from a brick and mortar store  you can also buy online: from food and clothes to guns and bombs, no matter what you're looking for, you're bound to find the right online store with just a few clicks of the mouse. This revolution has sent cold trembles down the backbones of brick and mortar business owners. And what was their reaction? They've opened online stores to go hand in hand with their conventional businesses. Nowadays, every \"Mom and Pop's\" cheesecake store also has a website. In a recent survey, 68% of small business owners have stated that they are scared of being put out of business by the powerful flood that e-commerce has become. So it's no wonder many of them have decided to join the revolution and establish some kind of an online presence even though most of them have stated that they dislike the Internet. But do the big players have reasons to be afraid? Are we going to start seeing ghostly, deserted Wal-Marts across the country? Probably not in the near future but the day will come when most people will just stop shopping offline anymore. A trip to Wal-Marts wastes time, burns gas and sometimes adds a few extra dots on the stress counter.

And as \"Time is money\", this practice is lifesaving for people who work two jobs. Technology will continue to advance and e-commerce will follow closely in its footsteps.

Probably not in the near future but the day will come when most people will just stop shopping offline anymore. A trip to Wal-Marts wastes time, burns gas and sometimes adds a few extra dots on the stress counter.

{"answer": 3, "choices": ["A New Way of Shopping.", "The Internet Revolution.", "What is the Reaction to Online Shopping?", "Is Online Shopping the Future of E-commerce?"], "question": "The Internet has revolutionized our lives to such an extent that for most people, the global network has become more than just a tool but rather an indispensable aid in everyday life. More and more people go online as wireless networks have brought the Internet closer and closer: it's on our mobile phones, in our cars and TV sets, in hospital surgery rooms and in fishing boats that battle the waves of the Atlantic. And this revolution has brought along with it a new way of shopping. Both big and small, e-commerce websites have literally flooded the Internet by the hundreds of thousands. Anything you can buy from a brick and mortar store  you can also buy online: from food and clothes to guns and bombs, no matter what you're looking for, you're bound to find the right online store with just a few clicks of the mouse. This revolution has sent cold trembles down the backbones of brick and mortar business owners. And what was their reaction? They've opened online stores to go hand in hand with their conventional businesses. Nowadays, every \"Mom and Pop's\" cheesecake store also has a website. In a recent survey, 68% of small business owners have stated that they are scared of being put out of business by the powerful flood that e-commerce has become. So it's no wonder many of them have decided to join the revolution and establish some kind of an online presence even though most of them have stated that they dislike the Internet.

What's more amazing is that these plants occur naturally (in special environments) in every state. In fact, they're found on every continent except Antarctica. You've probably seen a Venus' flytrap -- a small plant, which grows 6 to 8 inches tall in a container. At the end of its stalks   are leaves that act like traps  . Inside each trap is a lining of tiny hairs. When an insect lands on them, the traps suddenly shut. Over the course of a week or so, the plant feeds on its catch. The Venus' flytrap is just one of more than 500 species of meat-eating plants, says Barry Meyers-Rice, the editor of the International Carnivorous Plant Society's Newsletter.

Barry says a plant is meat-eating, only if it does all four of the following: \"attract, kill, digest, and absorb\" some form of insects. Meat-eating plants look and act like other green plants -- well, most of the time. All green plants make sugar to produce food. What makes meat-eating plants different is their special leaves, which need insects for one reason: nitrogen  . Nitrogen is a nutrient that they can't obtain any other way. Why? Almost all green plants on our planet get nitrogen from the soil. Meat-eating plants can't. They live in places where nutrients are hard to get from the soil because of its acidity.

Perhaps the drink is not so bad after all. The new study, conducted by the National Cancer Institute (NCI), has been published and suggests that coffee does not have a harmful effect on your health. Researchers suggest, based on data examined, older adults who drink a lot of coffee, have a lower risk of death when compared to their non-drinking coffee peers. The team of researchers conducting the study analyzed data on 400,000 U. S. men and women,aged 50 to 71 years; the individuals had participated in the NIH-AARP Diet and Health Study. This study started in 1995-1996 and was tracked until the day a participant passed away, or Dec. 31, 2008. According to a press release on the report, researchers shared that coffee drinkers are \"less likely to die from heart disease, respiratory disease, stroke, injuries and accidents, diabetes, and infections, although the relationship was not seen for cancer.\" Results indicated participants that drank three or more cups of coffee a day reduced their risk of death by 10 percent. Based on the findings that both caffeinated and non-caffeinated coffee found similar results, researchers are thinking caffeine is not the protective ingredient , although which ingredient in coffee might be, they are not sure. Researchers indicate that despite these observational findings, they caution  it is not clear whether or not drinking coffee actually extends life expectancy. \"Coffee is one of the most widely drunk drinks in America, but the relationship between coffee consumption and risk of death has been unclear. We found coffee consumption to be associated with lower risk of death overall, and of death from a number of different causes,\" said Neal Freedman, Ph. D., Division of Cancer Epidemiology and Genetics, NCI. \"Although we cannot infer a relationship between coffee drinking and lower risk of death, we believe these results do provide some comfort that coffee drinking does not adversely  affect health,\" Freedman said.

Perhaps the drink is not so bad after all. The new study, conducted by the National Cancer Institute (NCI), has been published and suggests that coffee does not have a harmful effect on your health. Researchers suggest, based on data examined, older adults who drink a lot of coffee, have a lower risk of death when compared to their non-drinking coffee peers. The team of researchers conducting the study analyzed data on 400,000 U. S. men and women,aged 50 to 71 years; the individuals had participated in the NIH-AARP Diet and Health Study. This study started in 1995-1996 and was tracked until the day a participant passed away, or Dec. 31, 2008. According to a press release on the report, researchers shared that coffee drinkers are \"less likely to die from heart disease, respiratory disease, stroke, injuries and accidents, diabetes, and infections, although the relationship was not seen for cancer.\" Results indicated participants that drank three or more cups of coffee a day reduced their risk of death by 10 percent. Based on the findings that both caffeinated and non-caffeinated coffee found similar results, researchers are thinking caffeine is not the protective ingredient , although which ingredient in coffee might be, they are not sure. Researchers indicate that despite these observational findings, they caution  it is not clear whether or not drinking coffee actually extends life expectancy. \"Coffee is one of the most widely drunk drinks in America, but the relationship between coffee consumption and risk of death has been unclear. We found coffee consumption to be associated with lower risk of death overall, and of death from a number of different causes,\" said Neal Freedman, Ph.

Videos of the accident showed fires lighting up the night sky, raising dust dozens of feet into the air, and people nearby said the explosion had broken windows. Tianjin resident Zhang Siyu, who lives several miles away from the accident site, said, \"I thought it was an earthquake, so I rushed downstairs without my shoes on. Only once I was outside did I realize it was an explosion. There was the huge fireball in the sky with thick clouds.

Whenever she gets the opportunity, she recounts in detail how she used to be told to respect the elders and betters. She was taught to speak only when she was spoken to, and when she went out on her own, she was reminded to say 'please' and 'thank you'. Children in her day, she continues, were expected to be seen and not heard, but these days you are lucky if you ever hear parents telling their children to mind their p's and q's. If you give her the chance, she then takes out of her drawer the old photograph album which she keeps there, and which she never tires of displaying. Of course when you look at pictures of her parents, you feel sure that, with a father as stern-looking as that, you too would have been \"seen and not heard\". He had a lot of neatly cut hair, long side-whiskers and a big moustache. In the photographs, he is always clutching   his coat with one hand, while in the other he holds a thin walking stick. Beside him sits his wife, with their children around her: Granny and her elder brothers. It always occurs to me that perhaps those long, stiff, black clothes were so clumsy to a little girl, that she hadn't enough breath left to be talkative, let alone mischievous  . It must have been a dull and lonely life too, for she stayed mainly at home during her childhood, while her brothers were sent away to school from an early age. Despite their long black shorts and their serious expressions in the photographs, I always suspect that their lives were considerably more enjoyable than hers. One can imagine them telling each other to shut up or mind their own business, as soon as their parents were out of sight. Going to see Granny on Sundays used to be a terrible experience. We would always be warned in advance to be on our best behavior, since my mother made a great effort to show how well brought up we were, in spite of our old, comfortable clothes, our incomprehensible (to Granny) slang, and our noisy games in the garden. We had to change into what Granny described as our \"Sundays best\" for lunch, when we would sit uncomfortably, kicking each other under the table. We were continually being ordered to sit up straight, to take our elbows off the table, to wait till everybody had been served, not to wolf down our food, nor to talk with our mouths full. At length we would be told to ask to be excused from the table and ordered to find quiet occupations for the rest of the day. We were always very bad-tempered by the evening, and would complain angrily all the way home. Yet though we hated the Sunday visit, we never questioned the rules of good manners themselves. I remember being greatly shocked as a child to hear one of my friends telling her father to shut up. I knew I could never have spoken like that to my father and it would never have occurred to me to do so. However, my childhood was much freer than Granny's. I went to school with my brother and I played football with him and his friends. We all spoke a common language, and we got up to the same mischief. I would have died if I had had to stay indoors, wear a tight dress, and sew. But I do sometimes look wistfully   at an old sampler which hangs in the hall, which was embroidered   by an even more distant relative--my great-great-aunt, of whom, regrettably, no photograph remains. It was done as an example of her progress in learning. The alphabet is carefully sewn in large colored childish letters from A to Z, and below it a small verse reads: Mary Saunders is my name, And with my needle I worked the same, That by it you may plainly see What care my parents have for me.

Arjun Makhijani is president of the Institute for Energy and Environmental Research in the United States. He says the disaster in Japan is historic. This week, the chairman of America's nuclear agency said there is little chance that harmful radiation  from Japan could reach the United States. Gregory also said America has a strong program in place to deal with earthquake threats. No new nuclear power centers have been built in the United States since nineteen seventy-nine. That was when America's worst nuclear accident happened at the Three Mile Island center in Pennsylvania. The accident began to turn public opinion against nuclear energy. At present, about twenty percent of electricity in the United States comes from nuclear energy. German Chancellor Angela Merkel said Germany would close seven nuclear power centers while energy policy is reconsidered. The European Union is planning to test all centers in its twenty-seven member nations. Developing nations are less willing to slow nuclear expansion. China said it will continue with plans to build about twenty-five new nuclear reactors . And India, under a cooperation agreement with the United States, plans to spend billions on new centers in the coming years. Nuclear reactors supply fourteen percent of global electricity. Nuclear energy is a clean resource, producing no carbon gases. But radioactive waste is a serious unresolved issue. So is the presence of nuclear power centers in earthquake areas like the one near Bushehr, Iran. The best title of the text is _ . A. Various Opinions on Japan's Nuclear Disaster B.

Feeling a sharp pain in her right shoulder, she changed the angle of stroke  , telling herself to go gently until her hand caught the water. In the 17thhour, she swam over to the boat, and the crew located a pain reliever. Nyad took it. She lay on her back, rolled onto her belly and continued swimming, and then she'd turn on her back again, gasping, unable to fill her lungs. \"I'm trying to make it. I'm barely going forward.

One afternoon, I picked my girls up. It was late when we returned home. I went to unlock the door and found my key wouldn't go in. I kept trying while my daughter went to get a flashlight. When she returned with it we found somehow the lock had been \"stuffed\" with sunflower seed shells. Thinking that one of the neighborhood children had been up to no good, I really didn't give it much consideration. I found all windows were locked up tight. So I returned to the back door. Oh my God, I will never forget the shock of that moment. The house was empty! Other than a few things remaining on the back porch, everything was gone! Then I heard a car pull into the driveway and found two policemen walking up. They inquired why I had broken into the house. They then asked me for proof that I lived at that address, so I asked them to wait a minute while I went to get my rent receipt and identification from inside the house. I explained the matter to them and showed them the door lock. I could tell from their actions and tone of voice that they thought I was breaking into an empty house for somewhere to sleep. I asked a neighbor for the phone number of house owner and the officer made a call. The owner was quite shocked to hear my story. She said that my roommate had been going through an eviction  process with the court when I moved in with her and had lost the case. She had been ordered to move by 10 am on that date. The court order had been issued the same day I had paid her 1/2 of the rent and a deposit of $300,000. The owner was very kind and understanding but there was nothing she could do. The house had been rented already and the people were to move in the following weekend. The officers let me go and I went to gather my girls into the car. They were both exhausted and old. Also very frightened, because they thought their mamma was going to jail. I had to pull over because the tears took control. I couldn't believe it!

However, despite years of competition in overseas markets, Japan's cellphone makers have little presence beyond the country's shores. The only Japanese cellphone maker with any meaningful global share is Sony Ericsson, and that company is a London-based joint venture between a Japanese electronics maker and a Swedish telecommunications firm. And Sony Ericsson has been hit by big losses. Its market share was just 6.3 percent in the first quarter of 2009, behind Nokia of Finland, Samsung Electronics and LG of South Korea, and Motorola of Illinois. This year, Mr Natsuno, who developed a popular wireless Internet service called i-Mode, invited some of the best minds in the field to debate how Japanese cellphones could go global. \"The most amazing thing about Japan is that even the average person out there will have a very advanced phone, \"said Mr Natsuno.

Indeed, Japanese cellphone makers thought they had positioned themselves to dominate the age of digital data. But they were a little too clever. In the 1990s, they set a standard for the second-generation network that was refused everywhere else. Then Japan quickly adopted a third-generation standard in 2001.

Snowball is a cockatoo, a kind of parrot, and his favorite song is \"Everybody\" by the Backstreet Boys. When he hears the song, he moves his feet and rocks his body with the tempo, or pace of the music, as though he is the only bird member of the boy band. Aniruddh Patel is a neuroscientist, or a scientist who studies how the brain and the nervous system contribute to learning, seeing and other mental abilities. He works at the Neurosciences Instiute in San Diego. After seeing Snowbaill's dance online, Patel visited the cockatoo at the bird rescue facility he's called home for two years. The scientist played \"Everybody\" for Snowball and also played versions of the song that were sped up or slowed down. Sometimes, Snowball danced too fast or too slowly. Often, when there was a change in tempo, Snowball adjusted his dancing to match the rhythm. In other experiments, scientists have observed the same abilities in preschool children. Patel isn't the only scientist who has studied Snowball's moves. Adena Schachner, who studies psychology at Harvard University, also wanted to know more about the dancing bird. Schachner's team played different musical pieces for Snowball and a parrot named Alex, as well as eight human volunteers. The scientists observed that the birds and the humans kept time to the music with about the same accuracy. Schachner and her team watched thousands of YouTube videos of different animals moving to music. Not all the animals could dance, however.

Often, when there was a change in tempo, Snowball adjusted his dancing to match the rhythm. In other experiments, scientists have observed the same abilities in preschool children. Patel isn't the only scientist who has studied Snowball's moves. Adena Schachner, who studies psychology at Harvard University, also wanted to know more about the dancing bird. Schachner's team played different musical pieces for Snowball and a parrot named Alex, as well as eight human volunteers. The scientists observed that the birds and the humans kept time to the music with about the same accuracy. Schachner and her team watched thousands of YouTube videos of different animals moving to music. Not all the animals could dance, however. From watching the videos, the scientists observed that only animals that imitate sounds, including 14 parrot species and Asian elephants, accurately moved in time to music. According to the scientists, Snowball's ability to dance to music is probably related to the fact that    _    .", "subject": ""}

You made several good points about the disadvantage of e-books. You may have overlooked, however, some of the ways in which they are superior to traditional books. Yes, e-books are expensive, but they are also convenient. In addition, due to their environment-friendly nature, e-books have the potential to change our planets for the better. E-books, for anyone who is unfamiliar with the term, are about the same size and shape as regular books. They have a large screen in the middle, however, this screen shows the reader a page of the text that has been downloaded from a computer. Once the reader has finished reading the page on the e-book screen, he or she scrolls down to see a new page. The process continues until the entire book has been read. As you pointed out, Mr. Slocum, it's great to lie on a warm, sandy beach with a book. You can do that just as easily with an e-book as you can with a traditional paper book. In fact, because e-books are so light, you can carry themselves. Say, for example, that you like to read on the bus. Which would you rather carry with you---a heavy 800-page novel, or an e-book that weighs only a few ounces? Another important advantage is offered by e-books as well. They are more environment-friendly than traditional books. At present, thousands of trees cut down each year to meet the publishing industry's demand for paper. Books that don't sell are eventually returned to the publisher and destroyed, This terrible waste could be avoided if everyone used e-books, which require no paper.

These three infectious diseases killed almost 6 million people last year. That is about 10 percent of the total number of deaths around the world last year. The WHO and UN agencies released a new report at the World Economic Forum in New York City earlier this month. The document says that deaths around the world from malaria and tuberculosis could be cut in half by the year 2010. It also says the number of deaths from AIDS could be reduced 25 percent within that same time period. The report is called \"Calling Up the Response to Infectious Diseases.\" It calls for huge new investments in methods to prevent and treat infectious diseases. Officials say money is needed for research and to purchase drugs. Money is also needed to devices to prevent diseases, such as bed nets. Bed nets prevent mosquitoes that carry malaria from biting people while they sleep. David Heymann, director of the infectious disease program at the World Health Organization, says that providing effective drug treatments is important for improving peoples' health and economic well - being. Reducing disease can also help improve economic growth in developing countries. The WHO report also describes successful health programs in developing countries. In Peru, for example, the number of tuberculosis cases was cut in half by increasing the treatment to control the disease. In Vietnam, malaria was reduced 97 percent through the use of bed nets. And in Uganda, cases of the virus that causes AIDS were cut in half among pregnant women and children through the use of anti - AIDS drugs.

Joe Heim: What do you think of a reporter who interviews you for 25 minutes, then later finds out his recorder stopped working and asks you to do the interview again? Valerie Jarrett: _ . You could have just tried to pretend that it didn't happen. Joe Heim: You're considered the president's closest adviser. Have you ever given him bad advice since he became president? Valerie Jarrett: I'm sure that I have. I think one of the reasons why the president's management style is very effective is because all of his advisers feel very comfortable being open about their advice. Finally, there's only one decision-maker. And that's the president. Joe Heim: What misunderstandings are there of you? Valerie Jarrett: A little-known fact is that I started my life very shy and remained very shy well into adulthood. Painfully shy, I would call it. And I often share this, particularly with young people, because it's something I really had to work hard to overcome. And for all the shy people out there I say, you, too, can overcome it. But it took a lot of hard work on my part, and I discovered along the way that just because you're nervous and you have butterflies in your stomach doesn't mean that it has to show. My point in sharing it with you is that part of life is pushing yourself outside of your comfort zone  . And if you're going to grow, you have to learn how to take on new challenges that you might not be good at. Joe Heim: Will you stay until the end of his term? Valerie Jarrett: I serve at the pleasure of the president. If he wants me to stay, I will. In which part of a newspaper could we find this text?", "subject": ""}

There are several arguments for allowing older people to continue working as long as they are able.Many people think that older employees have a large amount of knowledge and experience which can be lost to a business or organization if they are made to retire.Besides, older employees are often extremely faithful employees to and are more willing to _ company policies than the young.A more important point is regarding the attitudes in society to old people.To force someone to resign or retire at 60 or 65 indicates that the society does not value the input of these people and that effectively their useful life is over. Allowing old people to work indefinitely  , however, is not always a good policy.Some people took the strong view that age alone is no guarantee of ability.Many young employees have more experience or skills than older staff, who may have been stuck in one area for most of their working lives.Having compulsory retirement allows new ideas in an organization.On the other hand, older people should be rewarded by society for their life' s labor by being given generous pensions and the freedom to enjoy leisure.They can have time to do whatever they like, that is, they can have their own plans or roles and achieve their retirement goals. With many young people unemployed or frustrated in low-level positions, there are often calls to compulsorily retire older workers.However, this can affect the older individual' s freedom--and right--to work.In my opinion, giving workers more choices over their retirement age will benefit society and the individual.

She taught in Massachusetts for ten years, and was invited to Bordentown, New Jersey, to teach in a private school. She saw personally that these communities needed free education for their citizens, and she responded by creating a free school, one of the first in her state. Later, officials ignored her and appointed a male as principal instead. She resigned and moved to Washington DC, becoming the first woman employed by the U. S. Patent Office. Clara Barton was forever changed by her experience with the troops in the Civil War. She saw surgeons dressing wounds with cornhusks , since they had nothing else. The medical supplies for the Army were well behind the troops, who were moving faster than their medical supply lines. She brought in a wagon of bandages and medical supplies that she had collected personally beforehand. Barton continued to work on the battlefields throughout the war. She helped in the identification process of 13,000 dead Union soldiers. Afterward, she was an important figure in a campaign to identify missing soldiers from the Civil War. This non-stop work _ her, and upon recommendation by her physicians, she traveled to Europe to recover herself. While in Europe, and still in poor health Miss Barton was moved by the hardship on civilians brought about by the France-Prussia war.

Step l: Making A List Of Colleges To Apply To With over 6,000 colleges in the United States, the first step in applying to college is to do some research and make a college list . This process will be different for everyone. The number of colleges you apply to can vary, from applying to 1 school (not recommended) to 30 schools (not recommended),each applicant can choose how many colleges they apply to. Many limit the number because applications are accompanied by a fee.          . Step2: Splitting The List Into Target, Reach and Safety Schools In general, students will want to apply to three types of schools: Target, Reach and Safety schools. It is up to you how many applications you send, but a good mix would be more target than reach, and at least one safety. You will need to take your list, and now decide which are your top picks, which are attainable for you academically, which are affordable for you only with aid, and refine your broad list into a group of schools that gives you the best chance for success. Talk to an admissions counselor at your high school if you have questions about this. Step 3: Completing and Sending Applications to Colleges Once your list is complete you are ready to apply to college by completing and sending in applications! College applications take time to complete --you have to write essays, ask for recommendations and get test scores sent to schools--so stay organized! All colleges will require these types of application materials, so start thinking about these items well before October or December.

Afterward, I was too sick to eat lunch just thinking about it. I came straight home from school, went to my room, and lay on the floor trying to decide whether it would be better to run away from home now or after supper. Mostly I wished I was dead. Yesterday Mr. Burke announced there'd be a unit test and anyone who didn't pass would have to come to school on Saturday, most particularly me, since I didn't pass the last unit test. I did plan to study just to prove to him that I'm plenty smart--which I am mostly--except in math. Anyway, I got my desk ready to study on . Just when I was ready to work, Nicho came into my room with our new rabbit and it jumped on my desk and knocked the flashcards all over the floor. What a mess! Nicho and I finally took the rabbit outside but then Philip came to my room and also Marty from next door and before long it was dinner. After dinner my father said I could watch a special on television if I'd done all my homework. Of course I said I had. That was the beginning. I felt terrible telling my father a lie about the homework. It was nine o'clock when I got up to my room and that was too late to study for the unit test so I lay in my bed with the light off and decided what I would do the next day when I was in Mr. Burke's math class not knowing the 8- and 9-times tables. So, you see, the cheating was planned after all. The next day, I'd go into class as usual, acting like things were going just great. I'd sit down next to Stanley Plummer--he is so smart in math it makes you sick--and from time to time, I'd glance over at his paper to copy the answers. Lying on the floor of my room, I begin to think that probably I've been bad all along. It just took this math test to clinch it. I'll probably never tell the truth again. I tell my mother I'm sick when she calls me to come down for dinner. She doesn't believe me, but puts me to bed anyhow. I lie there in the early winter darkness wondering what terrible thing I'll be doing next when my father comes in and sits down on my bed. \"What's the matter?\" he asks. \"I've got a stomachache,\" I say. Luckily, it's too dark to see his face. \"Is that all?\" \"Yeah.\" \"Mommy says you've been in your room since school.\" \"I was sick there too,\" I say. \"She thinks something happened today and you're upset.\" That's the thing that really drives me crazy about my mother. She knows things sitting inside my head the same as if I was turned inside out. \"Well,\" my father says. I can tell he doesn't believe me. \"My stomach is feeling sort of upset.\" I hedge. \"Okay,\" he says and he pats my leg and gets up. Just as he shuts the door to my room I call out to him in a voice I don't even recognize as my own. \"How come?\" he calls back not surprised or anything. So I tell him I cheated on this math test. To tell the truth, I'm pretty much surprised at myself. I didn't plan to tell him anything. He doesn't say anything at first and that just about kills me. I'd be fine if he'd spank me or something. And then he says I'll have to call Mr. Burke. It's not what I had in mind. \"Now?\" I ask surprised. \"Now,\" he says. He turns on the light and pulls off my covers. \"I'm not going to,\" I say.

{"answer": 1, "choices": ["sushi", "blueberries", "pomegranates", "Vitamin D"], "question": "Below is some advice on how to prevent cancer: 8 Ways to Avoid Cancer in Your Life 1. Eat Blueberries Aside from being a healthy and delicious snack, blueberries contain pterostilbene, which has important colon  cancer-fighting prosperities. But wait, it gets better. Blueberries also offer a large dose of vitamins C (14 milligrams per cup). So at breakfast, try to take in a cup and a half of blueberries in your cereal or yogurt, or mixed with other berries. 2. Drink Pomegranate Juice The deep red juice of the pomegranate contains polyphenols, isoflavones and ellagic acid, which together create a powerful anticancer mixture. Most recently, researchers from the University of Wisconsin at Madison has discovered that 16 ounces of pomegranate juice per day also may inhibit the growth of lung cancer. 3. Relax Feeling stressed or worried? Find ways to relax and you may reduce your chances of developing cancer. Purdue University researchers tracked 1,600 men over 12 years and found that half of those with high levels of worry died during the study period. Only 20 percent of the optimists died before the study were completed, while 34 percent of the extremely anxious men died of some type of cancer. Instead of stressing about the past or future, focus on the present and relax! 4. Take Selenium  Selenium is well known for its cancer-fighting properties. In a study of almost 1,000 men, researchers from the Journal of the National Cancer Institute found that when men with the lowest initial levels of selenium in their bodies received a daily supplement over a 4 year period, they cut their prostate  cancer risk by a remarkable 92 percent. However, it is possible to get too much of a good thing, so monitor your intake of selenium-containing supplements, Brazil nuts, tuna, meats and grains carefully. 5. Eat Sushi  Seaweed may not be your idea of a great snack, but it is high in fiber, calcium and iron, and dry, roasted seaweed sheets used in sushi provide the additional benefits of vitamins A and C. Sushi rolls are also high in protein-- a typical spicy tuna roll has only 290 calories but packs 24 grams of protein. So don't skimp on the Sushi! 6. Enjoy the Outdoors Vitamin D causes early death of cancer cells. A study published in the American Journey of Clinical Nutrition reported that women who supplemented their diets with 1,000 international. Units of vitamin D every day had a 60 percent to 77 percent lower incidence of cancer ever a four-year period that did women taking a placebo . Experts recommend supplementing your fun in the sun with 1,100 to 2,000IU of vitamin D each day. 7. Breathe Clean Air There's no question that secondhand smoke kills. A recent American Journal of Public Health study showed that nonsmokers working in smoky places had three times the amount of carcinogen  in their urine  than nonsmokers working in smoke-free locations. What's worse, their levels of the carcinogen rose 6 percent for every hour worked. Nine states have banned smoking in all workplaces, bars and restaurants. The message is clear: Do whatever you can to avoid the cloud of smoke. 8. Break a Sweat Even a small amount of exercise can offer major cancer-fighting benefits. In a study of 29,110 men published in the International Journal of Cancer, men who exercised just once a week had a percent lower risk of metastasis  prostate cancer than men who didn't work out at all.

Besides this fact, obesity has risen by 214 percent and nearly two out of every three adults in America are overweight or obese. Being overweight is not only an appearance problem, and it also increases the risk of various diseases including diabetes, sleep disorder and cancer. With so much nutritional knowledge easy to find, we cannot simply ignore our present obesity epidemic . We know that fruits and vegetables are rich in vitamin. Though we are overweight, many of us choose junk food over healthy food out of habits. One explanation for our strong desire for junk food is that we learn to connect junk food with positive feelings when we are young, and changing this attitude requires a huge amount of confidence and determination. Fortunately, new research published in May 2012 has shown a simple and _ way to make healthier food choices- the one that doesn't rely on great determination. The research was based on two separate studies and it was carried out by T. Bettina Cornwell of the University of Oregon and Anna R. McAlister of Michigan State University. In the first study, 60 adults between the ages of 19 and 23 were questioned about the role of food and drinks. The survey tells us that adults prefer sweetened drinks with high-calorie, salty foods, to sweetened drinks with vegetables. In the second study, 75 children between the ages of 3 and 5 were gathered for some experiments including drinks served with vegetables. The preschooler experiments were carried out under different situations and on different days. The researchers found that the children chose to take more green vegetables when they were served with water instead of a sweetened drink. According to Cornwell, children learn to connect high calorie, sugary drinks such as cola, with high fat foods such as French fries, from a very early age. McAlister adds that early taste development appears to play an important role in food choices later in life. Meals served at home and meals offered at restaurants, set the stage for this idea and for the preference to choose junk food over healthy food, when beginning to take sweetened drinks. \"Our taste preferences are heavily influenced by regularly eating particular food and drinking particular drink,\" states Cornwell. \"If the drink on the table goes against both adults and children eating their vegetables, then perhaps it is time to change that drink... and to serve water with all meals. Restaurants could easily use water as free drink for children's meals and charge extra money for other drinks.\" Both McAlister and Cornwell are confident that serving water with meals could effectively reduce the nation's obesity rates, diabetes rates and ever rising healthcare costs.

Fortunately, new research published in May 2012 has shown a simple and _ way to make healthier food choices- the one that doesn't rely on great determination. The research was based on two separate studies and it was carried out by T. Bettina Cornwell of the University of Oregon and Anna R. McAlister of Michigan State University. In the first study, 60 adults between the ages of 19 and 23 were questioned about the role of food and drinks. The survey tells us that adults prefer sweetened drinks with high-calorie, salty foods, to sweetened drinks with vegetables. In the second study, 75 children between the ages of 3 and 5 were gathered for some experiments including drinks served with vegetables. The preschooler experiments were carried out under different situations and on different days. The researchers found that the children chose to take more green vegetables when they were served with water instead of a sweetened drink. According to Cornwell, children learn to connect high calorie, sugary drinks such as cola, with high fat foods such as French fries, from a very early age. McAlister adds that early taste development appears to play an important role in food choices later in life. Meals served at home and meals offered at restaurants, set the stage for this idea and for the preference to choose junk food over healthy food, when beginning to take sweetened drinks. \"Our taste preferences are heavily influenced by regularly eating particular food and drinking particular drink,\" states Cornwell. \"If the drink on the table goes against both adults and children eating their vegetables, then perhaps it is time to change that drink... and to serve water with all meals. Restaurants could easily use water as free drink for children's meals and charge extra money for other drinks.\" Both McAlister and Cornwell are confident that serving water with meals could effectively reduce the nation's obesity rates, diabetes rates and ever rising healthcare costs.

The reality of college can be pretty different from the images presented in movies and television. Instead of the students who wake up late, party all the time, and study only before exams, many colleges are full of students with pressing schedules of not just classes and activities, but real jobs, too. This isn't a temporary phenomenon.The share of working students has been on the rise since the 1970s, and one-fifth of students work yearround. About one-quarter of those who work while attending school have both a full-courseload and a full-time job. The arrangement can help pay for tuition   and living costs, obviously. And there's value in it beyond the direct cause: such jobs can also be critical for developing important professional and social skills that make it easier to land a job after graduation. With many employers looking for students with already-developed skill sets, on-the-job training while in college can be the best way to ensure a job later on. But it's not all upside. Even full-time work may not completely cover the cost of tuition and living expenses. The study notes that if a student worked a full-time job at the federal minimum wage, they would earn just over $15,000 each year, certainly not enough to pay for tuition, room, and board at many colleges without some serious financial aid. That means that though they're sacrificing time away from the classroom, many working students will still graduate with at least some debt. And working fulltime can reduce the chance that students will graduate at all, by cutting into the time available for studying and attending classes. There is little reward for attending but not finishing college. Students who wind up leaving school because of difficulty in managing work and class are likely to find themselves stuck in some of the same jobs they might have gotten if they hadn't gone at all. The difficulty of working too much while in school can create a cycle that pushes students further into debt without receiving any of the financial or career benefits.

The lead wolf raised his head into the air and took in a deep breath, as if he was smelling my presence. The animals looked both beautiful and frightening, but I knew I could not show them my fear. As I drew nearer, the lead wolf raised its head once more but this time let out a long, loud cry. The awful cry rang out across the silent valley. I had never heard a more frightening sound. I was almost certain it was a sign to be death. Every moment I expected to see the pack of wolves dash at me, I knew my only hope was to pretend I had no fear.

S. It is the residence of the president of the French Republic and the symbol of the supreme authority in France. The Elysee palace, with an area of 11,000 square metres, is at the eastern end of the Champs Elysee in the city of Paris proper and backed by a large and peaceful garden of more than twenty thousand square metres. Its main building, quite handsome and graceful, is a two-story classical stone architecture of European style, and beside it are two side buildings facing each other and with an extensive rectangular courtyard in the middle. There are altogether 369 halls and rooms of different sizes. The Elysee Palace, built in 1718, has a ling history of close to300 years to date. This house was at first a private residence of a count named d'Evreau, so it was called Hotel d'Evreau. It had later gone through many changes and its owners had been changed for many times, but all the residents in it were distinguished persons and high officials. The house was renamed Bonaparte Mansion when it was owned by Louis X V and Louis X VI successively when they acted as emperors. Napoleon I signed his act of abdication here when he had suffered defeat in the Battle of Waterloo in 1815. Nopoleon III moved in the   Mansion in 1848 when he was elected president, and the house became a Royal Palace when he declared himself as emperor. The Third French Republic issued a decree in 1873, appointing officially the Elysee Palace as the residence president of the French Republic. Over the hundred years since then, almost all the president of the French Republic worked and lived there. Starting from 1989, the Elysee Palace is open to the public every year in September on the French Castles Day. Which of the following is NOT mentioned in the passage?", "subject": ""}

Teachers teach and students learn, and many scientists are interested in finding ways to improve both teaching and learning processes.      Sian Beilock and Susan Leving, two psychologists at the University of Chicago, are trying to learn about learning. In a new study about the way kids learn math in primary school, Beilock and Levine found a surprising relationship between what female teachers think and what female students learn: If a female teacher is uncomfortable with her own math skills, then her female students are more likely to believe that boys are better than girls at math. \"If these girls keep getting math-anxious female teachers in later grades,  _ ,\" Levine told Science News. The study suggests that if these girls grow up believing that boys are better at math than girls are, then these girls may not do as well as they would have if they were more confident.      Just as students find certain subjects to be difficult, teachers can find certain subjects to be difficult to learn--and teach. The subject of math can be particularly difficult for everyone.

A bad friend is someone whose jealousies and insecurities outweigh their love for someone. They night want to be a good friend but they're too messed up in their own head to ever actually do it. They wonder if their friends are going out without them or if they're being forgotten and left behind. People who are violently insecure don't have what it takes to be the quality of a friend. Bad friends are narcissistic .They look for any opportunity to bring the conversation back to them. Worse, they might not even be aware that they're doing it. In their mind, they might think they are the best friend ever, which is truly frightening. Bad friends are quick-change. They're by your side when you're fun and you have something to give them but as soon as you're going through a difficult time, they will become indifferent quickly. They won't bring you cold medicine. They won't give you a ride to the doctor, everything they do is self-serving. If you find a friend who has these same characteristics, send them to your bad friend list immediately. Your friends are supposed to be the solution to your problems, not the source. I believe your twenties are a time when you need positive and helpful friends. In such a time, friendships aren't easy to maintain like they once were in school. Now we actually have to put work into it, we have to make a conscious effort to keep the friendship going. You need to ask yourself, \"Is this person worth it? Do they treat me like a fool or what?\" if your have doubts, try to make them clear by considering the past experiences. Toxic  friendships do nothing but drag you down. My point is that you have to take care of yourself and stop getting in touch with your bad friends. Only surround yourself with people who bring out the best qualities in you. It may sound cruel but it's true,. What is the purpose of the passage?", "subject": ""}

A VJ(video jockey) is a person who introduces music videos on television. VJs were first seen on television in the early 1980s when MTV went on the air. As MTV became popular, and the audience for music videos expanded, a variety of other music video channels started broadcasting. In addition to rock music, there were channels for people who had a lot of interest in alternative kinds of music, such as country music, light music, and R&B(rhythm and blues), and all of these channels needed VJs. By the 1990s, international music video channels like Channel V in Asia and VIVA in Europe had started. The VJs for the new international stations had to be chosen carefully. Although some VJs did shows that focused on small audiences and showed mostly local content, other VJs presented shows for international viewers. These VJs, and the material they presented, needed to be popular in several different cultures. One successful international VJ in Asia is Asha Gill. She is from prefix = st1 /Malaysia, but her parents and grandparents are fromIndia,FranceandEngland. She speaks three languages and has fans across Asia, fromJapanto theUnited Arab Emirates.

The 11 oil ministers decided to meet again on July 3 to discuss the effects of the Iraq temporary stop. The organization's president, Charkid Kheria of Algeria, said after the meeting that stocks were high and prices were stable, so quota increases were not necessary. The E.U. Commission has expressed concern about Iraq's output stop. A speaker said OPEC had to take all possible measures to keep or lower the oil price. Saudi Arabia's Oil Minister Ali Al-Nuaimi had earlier said there would not be any shortfall of oil in the market. The organization had already taken steps to fill the gap, he said. OPEC Secretary General Ali Rodriguez added that the period of Iraq's output stop was not known, so other exporters were not going to lift quotas yet. If the market was destabilized (......), a suitable response could be made. Iraq on Monday stopped shipments of crude oil to protest against the U.N.

Suddenly, a loud noise wakes him up. Naturally,   Brandon reaches for his cell phone. He blinks twice, and the message on the screen becomes clear: \" R U awake?\" But the late-night text does not annoy   Brandon. He gets frequent messages and calls, even after bedtime. And he can't imagine life without them. \" If I didn't have a cell phone, I wouldn't be able to talk to my friends or family as often,\" he told TFK. Brandon's use of technology doesn't stop there. He also has a computer, a TV and three video-game consoles in his room. With so many choices, it is no surprise that when he is not at school, he spends nearly every waking minute using one or more of these devices. Brandon is hardly alone. According to a recent study by the Kaiser Family Foundation, kids aged 8 to 18 are spending more time than ever before using electronic devices. How much time? More than seven and a half hours a day on average, the study found. That's about an hour more than just five years ago. The jump is the result of a huge explosion in mobile devices, says Victoria Rideout, the lead author of the study. Today, nearly seven out of ten kids have cell phones. Just five years ago, it was four out of ten. \" These devices have opened up many more opportunities for young people to use media, whether it's on the bus, on the way to school or waiting in line at the pizza parlor,\" says Rideout. Often, kids multitask, or use more than one device at a time. \" If you've got a chance to do something on your computer and take a phone call and have the TV on in the background, why not?\" Media expert Cheryl Olson says. Most experts agree technology has much to offer kids. But some worry the kids could be missing out on other activities like playing outside or hanging out with friends. \" It's a matter of balance,\" says Olson. \" You've got to work on it.\" Multitasking while doing homework is another concern.

Handwriting is still an important part of our everyday life. We may spend a lot of time typing on a computer for work and less time writing things down, but it doesn't mean we should forget the basic skills. The following may be useful for you to help a child develop great handwriting skills.  Writing paper is very important. Since children are discovering which way the letters shape and bend , you need to give them enough room to experiment. Constricting their writing space will cause them to develop skills that won't be helpful.  Spacing between letters is a must. Before they learn to read words they see how letters of the alphabet are placed. There is a space between each letter, not a large space but enough to show that it's being reserved .When they begin to write, you can suggest that they lay their fingers between the letters they have written and the letters they are going to write.  Express praise for any effort and correct with loving kindness. When children are trying things for the first time, they want to succeed. They see their parents skillfully cooking and driving and to them, you are the master, and they want to be masters, too. Help them correct their own writing as well; don't do it for them, or they will expect it each time. Pretty soon you will have few hand written notes with backwards letters covering your refrigerator.  Find some handwriting worksheets  and it will become more funny to learn how to write. Schools can offer that kind of lesson. Give them something interesting to do with their handwriting skills will help them develop more confidence. And remember that learning takes time.

I want you to build me a fence--an 8-foot fence --so I won't need to see his place anymore. Cool him down, anyhow.\"      The carpenter said, \"I think I understand the situation. I'll be able to do a job that pleases you.\" The older brother had to go to town for supplies, so he helped the carpenter get the materials ready and then he was off for the day.   The carpenter worked hard all that day measuring, sawing, nailing. About sunset when the farmer returned, the carpenter had just finished his job. The farmer's eyes opened wide, his jaw dropped.       There was no fence there at all. It was a bridge-- a bridge stretching from one side of the creek to the other! A fine piece of work-- and his younger brother was coming across, his hand outstretched.   \"You are quite a fellow to build this bridge after all I've said and done.\"   The brothers stood at each end of the bridge, and then they met in the middle, taking each other's hand. They turned to see the carpenter lift his toolbox on his shoulder. \"No, wait! Stay a few days. I've a lot of other projects for you,\" said the older brother.   \"I'd love to stay on,\" the carpenter said, \"but, I have so many more bridges to build.\" Which of the following is NOT true according to the passage?", "subject": ""}

It was found that species that live in larger groups have faces with more complex color patterns than those that live in smaller groups.

How they do it is a mystery but they must come from somewhere. Let's assume they come from the \"unconscious.\" This is reasonable, for psychologists use this term to describe mental processes which are unknown to the individual. Creative thought depends on what was unknown becoming known. All of us have experienced this sudden arrival of a new idea, but it is easiest to examine it in the great creative personalities, many of whom experienced it in an intensified form and have written it down in their life stories and letters.

All truly creative activities depend in some degree on these signals from the unconscious, and the more highly insightful the person is, the sharper and more dramatic the signals become. A type of creative experience is illustrated by the dreams which came to Descartes at the age of twenty-three and determined his life path.

Before you begin your talk,be kind to your voice.Avoid milk or creamy drinks which coat your throat.Keep your throat wet by drinking a little sweetened warm tea or water-down fruit juice. If you sense that you are losing your voice,stop talking completely.Save your voice for your speech.You may feel foolish using paper to write notes,but the best thing you can do is to rest your voice.If you feel the need to see a doctor,perhaps getting some advice from a professional singer can be a better choice.In the meantime,do not even talk in a low voice. What about drinking alcohol to wet your throat?I advise you not to touch alcohol before speaking.The problem with alcohol is that one drink gives you a little confidence.The second drink gives you even more confidence.Finally you will feel all-powerful and you will feel you can do everything,but in fact your brain and your mouth do not work together properly.Save the alcohol until after you finish speaking.

{"answer": 0, "choices": ["On Self-Appreciation", "Types of Appreciation", "Power of Appreciation", "Uses of Appreciation"], "question": "Frankly, I very much appreciate myself. Yes, I admit I'm in many respects not as good as other people, but I don't think I'm always not good. When I find what I've done or written is okay, I'll remain pleased with myself for quite a few days, and in case I receive praise for it, I'll even become so excited as to add a few words to glorify myself. True, I'm not modest at all. People may call me conceited  . But I think otherwise. I also appreciate other people. I appreciate anything good. Isn't it unfair to forget appreciating myself while appreciating others? We Chinese generally tend to be modest, and we take pride in being so. For example, a Chinese will call his own wife zhuojing, meaning \"my humble wife\", and his own writings zhuozuo, meaning \"my poor writings\". But if you should call his wife a \"rustic   woman\" or his writings \"trash\", he would, I'm sure, slap the table in a rage and declare he would make a clean break with you. As a matter of fact, there is probably no difference at all between what is said by him and you respectively. I don't think it's wrong for you to freely praise yourself if you're really worthy of praise. As we know, there is an old Chinese saying disparaging   a melon peddler , named Lao Wang, who keeps praising his own goods. Well, why can't he praise his melons if they are really sweet and juicy? Friends, Lao Wang sells melons for a living. How could he carry on business if he, by imitating the affectations of us intellectuals, were to show false modesty about his melons? He would sure enough die of starvation. Self-appreciation is therefore key to professional dedication   and enjoyment of work.

There are certain things British men like to believe about themselves. The first is that one day they will again win the World Cup. They also believe they do not cry.

As a result, Kleenex is launching the \"Let It Out\" campaign that encourages Britons to grab a tissue and have a good cry. These days, however, the male Briton's attitude toward crying is changing. Though the majority still struggles to open up emotionally, a 2004 study by Oxford's Social Issues Research Center found that 77 percent of British men considered crying in public increasingly acceptable. Half of London males admitted crying in front of their mothers. Scotsmen are the least emotional, although they are the most likely to cry at weddings.

Among his new colleagues were the directors of the Shanghai Library and the Shanghai Tourism Bureau. Yao is the youngest and, at 7-foot-6, the tallest member of the 142-person committee. Even in retirement, Yao Ming is still one of the most famous men in China. Plenty of organizations and Yao himself are seemingly eager to use his influential capital while the going is still good. \"Yao said the new title shows trust coming from the people in the city,\" Yao spokesman Zhang Chi told the China Daily. Zhang denied that Yao harbored any political aspirations. \"The responsibilities for a CPPCC member include offering political consultation, and supervision. What Yao wants is to use his influence to do good deeds for society, but not to seek a political position,\" Zhang said. With the new job Yao is expected to attend regular meetings and offer suggestions or written proposals to the local government. \"Raising proposals is very serious business, and I do not want to be hasty,\" Yao told the press after the meeting, adding that he will be focusing his efforts on sports education, an area he is more familiar with. Yao will have to juggle this new political job with a fulltime gig at Shanghai's prestigious Jiao Tong University (though through custom, private one-on-one degree program) and his commitments as owner of Shanghai's professional basketball team, The Sharks, which he used to play for.

Another area that technology is changing is entertainment.Music, for example, was once a group experience.People listened to music at concert halls or in small social gatherings.For many people now, however, music is an individual experience.Walking along the street or sitting in their living-rooms, they wear headphones to build a wall of music around them.Movie entertainment is changing as well.Movies used to be social events.Now, fewer people are going out to see a movie.Many more are choosing to wait for a film to appear on television or are borrowing videotapes to watch at home.Instead of laughing with others, viewers watch movies in their own living-rooms.

The world of business is one area in which technology is separating us.Experts say, for example, that many people will soon be able to work at home.With access to a large central computer, employees such as office clerks, insurance agents, and accountants could do their jobs at display terminals   in their own homes.They would never have to actually see the people they're dealing with.In addition, the way employees are paid will change.Workers' salaries will be automatically paid into their bank accounts, making paper checks unnecessary.No workers will stand in line to receive their pay or cash their checks.Personal banking will change, too.Customers will deal with machines to put in or take out money from their accounts.Many companies and consumers have already changed the way they sell or buy products.E-commerce, or business done on the Internet, is becoming more and more popular.This, therefore, makes it possible for people to do shopping without going out of their homes. Another area that technology is changing is entertainment.Music, for example, was once a group experience.People listened to music at concert halls or in small social gatherings.For many people now, however, music is an individual experience.Walking along the street or sitting in their living-rooms, they wear headphones to build a wall of music around them.Movie entertainment is changing as well.Movies used to be social events.Now, fewer people are going out to see a movie.Many more are choosing to wait for a film to appear on television or are borrowing videotapes to watch at home.Instead of laughing with others, viewers watch movies in their own living-rooms.

In fact, they say by the age of eighty-five, people are happier with their life than they were when they were eighteen years old. The findings came from a survey of more than three hundred forty thousand adults in the United States. The Gallup Organization questioned them by telephone in two thousand eight. At that time, the people were between the ages of eighteen and eighty-five. The researchers asked questions about emotions like happiness, sadness and worry. They also asked about mental or emotional stress. Arthur Stone in the Department of Psychiatry and Behavioral Science at Stony Brook University in New York led the study. His team found that levels of stress were highest among adults between the ages of twenty-two and twenty-five. The findings showed that stress levels dropped sharply after people reached their fifties. Happiness was highest among the youngest adults and those in their early seventies. The people least likely to report feeling negative emotions were those in their seventies and eighties. The findings appeared in the Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences. Researchers say they do not know why happiness increases as people get older. One theory is that, as people grow older, they grow more thankful for what they have and have better control of their emotions. They also spend less time thinking about bad experiences. Professor Stone says the emotional patterns could be linked to changes in how people see the world, or maybe even changes in brain chemistry. The researchers also considered possible influences like having young children, being unemployed or being single. But they found that influences like these did not affect the levels of happiness and well-being related to age. The study also showed that men and women have similar emotional patterns as they grow older. However, women at all ages reported more sadness, stress and worry than men.

Lastly, by his own nature as a man: disease may attack him, and death will certainly come to him sooner or later.

When men become organized into very large groups, and civilization   develops, it is possible to get freedom from hunger, thirst, cold, heat and many diseases, so that each person can live a happier life than he could if he were living alone; but such a society can not work successfully unless the freedom of each human being is to some extent limited so that he is kept from hurting others. I am not free to kill others, nor to steal someone else's property, nor to behave in a way that offends   against the moral sense of the society in which I live.

If each man had to grow his own food, make his own clothes, build his own house and learn to be his own doctor, he would find it impossible to do any one of these jobs really well.

The results suggest skipping punctuation altogether, as it indicates you are answering naturally and heartfelt. Binghamton University's Harpur College observed 126 students, who read a series of messages displayed as texts on a screen or handwritten notes on loose-leaf paper . In the 16 experimental exchanges, the sender's message contained a statement followed by an invitation phrased as a question such as, \"Dave gave me his extra ticket.

{"answer": 3, "choices": ["Working hard to avoid a sense of emptiness.", "Finding a specific purpose for our own life.", "Relying on our achievements to be happy.", "Seeking happiness from our inner mind."], "question": "Seeking to find happiness through a job before you find happiness on a personal level is like trying to stand on stilts  on quicksand. That's how Anahita Moghaddam feels about it, anyway. She believes it is our \"primary responsibility\" to cultivate  love and happiness within ourselves, first and foremost. Moghaddam says that if you only look to your professional achievements to keep your sense of purpose and well-being going, a sense of emptiness or desperation can't almost be avoided.  You and your brain are more flexible than you think. The brain changes and grows depending on what it interacts with. Positive thoughts will give support to neuron pathways  for the feeling of joy; negative thoughts will make neuron pathways for feelings of sadness stronger. \"The number of possible combinations of neurons that fire and wire together is 10 to the millionth power in your nervous system. In comparison, the number of atoms in our entire universe is estimated to be around 10 to the 80th power. If we are 10 to the millionth power, that makes us almost infinite. So what are we? Who are we? And what can we do with this?\" she says. Unfortunately, human brains have several biological tendencies to negative thoughts and feelings. First, human brains can identify and avoid threats. Often, that means that other humans instinctively register as competition, instead of teammates or comrades. Second, we're biologically likely to remember a single negative incident more than multiple positive experiences.  Despite it, we can control the thoughts with mindfulness. As Rick Hanson explains, changes in our thoughts can change the grey matter in our brains, and vice versa. \"Mental activity is like a spring shower, leaving little traces of neural structure behind,\" he says. \"Over time, the little tracks in the hillside draw in more water down, deepening their course.\" There are benefits to living mindfully other than happiness. People who try to live more mindfully can focus for longer periods of time. \"The ability to focus more strategically makes you more clear. It makes you show up to your own life more fully,\" Moghaddam says. \"Happiness and creativity are the purpose and they are also the byproduct of living mindfully, living with purpose. Otherwise it is a social idea, and a concept that we grasp at, but it really starts in your heart.\" What does Moghaddam think the most important for us?", "subject": ""}

Chances are that you're all too familiar with the feeling that you and your wife are from different worlds. When married people start noticing their fundamental differences, it can lead to a breakdown in communication. The way to have a successful marriage is through communication, common ground and understanding. Here are some pointers to guide you in the right direction. Rather than ending up in an endless back and forth, forget about the issue for a minute. Instead, think about how you feel she's acting toward you and ask her if that's how she feels about you. If you think she's being unfair, ask her if she thinks you're being unfair. Switching the focus to that shared feeling can help your wife see things from your point of view. It's important to accept the fact that there's a two-way street between you and your wife. If you think she doesn't make enough of an effort to see things from your point of view, you have to ask yourself if you're making an effort to see it her way. Realize nobody can wave a magic wand to make you and your wife completely understand each other all the time. Many couples have an extremely close friendship and do almost everything together before they're married. Once you've tied the knot, you may begin to notice that you're not as alike as you once thought. It seems obvious, but some guys get fooled into thinking their wife will be as excited about all of their interests and hobbies as they are. Don't be surprised when you find out that she's not just like \"one of the guys.\" Sooner or later you'll realize that she might be going along with some of your interests just to make you happy. Rather than feel offended if you find out she's not as into your favorite hobby as you thought, appreciate the effort she put into making you happy. Swallow your pride and try to take part in some of her hobbies, too, even if you might _ at first. While you're not going to be trying on makeup with her, you could try baking a recipe together. If either of you is always giving everything and getting nothing in return, there's going to be bitterness. The best marriages are built on compromise.

{"answer": 3, "choices": ["Focus on the feeling to get past the disagreement.", "Don't play the blame game.", "She won't always understand you (but that's OK).", "Try to understand each other all the way."], "question": "If you're like a lot of married guys, you don't need to be reminded about men being from Mars or women from Venus. Chances are that you're all too familiar with the feeling that you and your wife are from different worlds. When married people start noticing their fundamental differences, it can lead to a breakdown in communication. The way to have a successful marriage is through communication, common ground and understanding. Here are some pointers to guide you in the right direction. Rather than ending up in an endless back and forth, forget about the issue for a minute. Instead, think about how you feel she's acting toward you and ask her if that's how she feels about you. If you think she's being unfair, ask her if she thinks you're being unfair. Switching the focus to that shared feeling can help your wife see things from your point of view. It's important to accept the fact that there's a two-way street between you and your wife. If you think she doesn't make enough of an effort to see things from your point of view, you have to ask yourself if you're making an effort to see it her way. Realize nobody can wave a magic wand to make you and your wife completely understand each other all the time. Many couples have an extremely close friendship and do almost everything together before they're married. Once you've tied the knot, you may begin to notice that you're not as alike as you once thought. It seems obvious, but some guys get fooled into thinking their wife will be as excited about all of their interests and hobbies as they are. Don't be surprised when you find out that she's not just like \"one of the guys.\" Sooner or later you'll realize that she might be going along with some of your interests just to make you happy. Rather than feel offended if you find out she's not as into your favorite hobby as you thought, appreciate the effort she put into making you happy. Swallow your pride and try to take part in some of her hobbies, too, even if you might _ at first. While you're not going to be trying on makeup with her, you could try baking a recipe together. If either of you is always giving everything and getting nothing in return, there's going to be bitterness. The best marriages are built on compromise. You knew you were going to have to give and take for your marriage to work; now it's time to make it happen. Which of the following is not good for keeping a successful marriage?", "subject": ""}

While it used to be a matter of making an extra effort to save energy and reduce waste in our homes, this has extended to the professional side of things since. Public buildings, such as schools, hospitals and offices, are under an increasing amount of pressure to make the change and go green, even if it's just a step-by-step process that takes a few years to implement completely. There are plenty of reasons for offices to go green and these reasons go beyond the concept that it should be done just for the sake of the environment. While the environment is incredibly important and vital to our survival and quality of life, sustainable office design can also have positive impacts upon employees and people using the building. For example, a report carried out last September revealed that the way an office is designed can significantly impact on the health of the staff there. It was also found to have an effect on productivity and could be a contributory factor to the amount of sick leave and staff turnaround within the business. It's fascinating to think that people can be so sensitive to their environments but it also makes a lot of sense. Even the choice of colour in your office can negatively or positively affect the people working there.  Based on this study, it is clear that companies should be making more efforts to improve on the office design while making sure the environment is sustainable and green. There are various little changes that can be made to lead to something bigger, from making sure the lights are turned off at night to recycling the paper your company gets through on a weekly basis. Once these changes are in place, you can start looking at the bigger picture and begin implementing changes to design and construction, like having wood fibre insulation fitted. Along with other sustainable features, insulation can be beneficial in various ways. Not only will an insulated office space be environmentally sound by helping you to keep warm in the winter and cool in the summer, reducing the reliance on the thermostat and central heating and saving money, but it can also be an effective form of sound absorption.

Alongside the existence of documented evidence, there are plenty of claims that have turned out to be cheating.

Over the years there have been numerous ESP experiments conducted by serious scientists in serious institutions. Joseph Banks Rhine, a botanist at Duke University published a famous book in 1934 called \"Extra-Sensory Perception\" in which he claimed to have enormous evidence of ESP. However, other scientists have been unable to copy his results since, which has resulted in the book losing much of its original credibility and fame.

Shakespeare might have borrowed from other writers, but the intensity of his imagination and language made the plays his own. While many plays by other writers of his time have been forgotten, Shakespeare and his art live on. Shakespeare was also influenced by the world around him. He described the sights and sounds of London in his plays. His works include observations about political struggles, the fear of diseases, and the popular language of the city's tradesmen. Shakespeare's knowledge of the English countryside is also clear. His works include descriptions of deep forests, local flowers, and the ancient popular traditions of rural people. It would be impossible to list all of the ways in which Shakespeare's works have influenced the world culture. But the first and greatest example would be his great influence on the English language. During his time, the English language was changing. Many new words from other languages were being added. Shakespeare used his sharp mind and poetic inventiveness to create hundreds of new words and rework old ones. For example, he created the noun forms of \"critic\", \"mountaineer\" and \"eyeball\". Many common expressions in English come from his plays, including \"pomp and circumstance \"from \"Othello\"(<<>> ), \"full circle \" from \"King Lear\"(<<>> ), etc. The list of cultural creations influenced by Shakespeare is almost endless. From paintings to television to music and dance, Shakespeare was well represented. Shakespeare's plays have been translated into every major language in the world. Shakespeare became a well-known writer during a golden age of theater. His years of hard work paid off. The passage is mainly about  _  .", "subject": ""}

What we typically call \" smog\"  today is a mixture of pollutants but is primarily made up of ground-level ozone   .      Ozone can be beneficial or harmful depending on where it stays. The ozone staying high above the Earth protects human health and the environment, but ground-level ozone is responsible for the choking, coughing, and painful eyes associated with smog. The ozone in smog also prevents plants growth and can cause widespread damage to crops and forest.      Major smog occurrences often are linked to heavy motor vehicle traffic, high temperatures, sunshine, and calm winds. Weather and geography affect the position and severity of smog. Because temperature regulates the length of time it takes for smog to form, smog can form faster and be more severe on a hot and sunny day. When warm air stays near the ground instead of rising and winds are calm, smog may stay trapped over your city for days. As traffic and other sources add more pollutants to the air, the smog gets worse. Smog is often more severe away from the pollution sources because the chemical reactions that cause smog occur in the atmosphere while the reacting chemicals are being moved by the wind.     Smog is a visible example of air pollution. You can look into the distance during the day to see how much smog there is in the air.

When warm air stays near the ground instead of rising and winds are calm, smog may stay trapped over your city for days. As traffic and other sources add more pollutants to the air, the smog gets worse. Smog is often more severe away from the pollution sources because the chemical reactions that cause smog occur in the atmosphere while the reacting chemicals are being moved by the wind.     Smog is a visible example of air pollution. You can look into the distance during the day to see how much smog there is in the air. In addition, most cities measure the concentrations of pollutants in the air and report the results to the public.      Environmental Protection Agency sets national standards for pollutants. Areas that fail to meet the standards for at least one air pollutant are called \"nonattainment    areas. \" New measures are being taken by local governments across the country to reduce air pollution in nonattainment areas. These include: banning charcoal barbecues and wood burning in stoves or fireplaces when pollution levels are high; developing programs to encourage carpooling and voluntary \"ozone actions\" ; limiting traffic in overcrowded areas; expanding or improving public transportation systems;  requiring employers to contribute to employee public transportation costs;  assessing \" smog fees\" on cars according to the number of miles driven and vehicle emissions  produced; and even buying and breaking up older \" super-dirty\"  cars.

Within six hours,the old man walked up the stairs for 25 times,among which he was helped for 23 times. What's more,two ladies tried to help the old man--one in the front and the other in the back. They carried the case up the stairs for him. The most noteworthy thing was that another old man tried to help too. When these kind people were asked why they helped the stranger,they all said \" It's just the right thing to do,\" \"I always help people as long as I can\" ,or \"it's not a big thing, and I just want to help\".

White-haired, with a Pennsylvania Dutch accent, Henry could usually be seen in a baseball cap, a T-shirt and a pair of jeans. He was the custodian, and he was the most respected and most well-known person in the building. Everyone loved Henry, and it was because of all the implicit ways he expressed his love for everyone around him. Henry didn't have to say, \"I love you.\" He lived his love. Henry was always excited when he met someone new, and he wanted to know everything about them. He felt it was important to do things for people he valued. And Henry seemed to value everyone he met. He brought in articles or cartoons for certain people, went out of his way to introduce people to each other, kept dozens of names and birthdays in his wallet so he could send cards, and helped students keep in touch with graduates who had written to him. He even assisted students who didn't have enough money to buy their books.  Henry taught me --- and many others he supported --- how to live life to the fullest. Not by skydiving or exploring some foreign countries, but by appreciating where you are in life and valuing those around you.

{"answer": 2, "choices": ["served with a drink in old times", "popular with people around the world", "a drink enjoyed by the rich in old times", "bought easily in stores in old times"], "question": "Most people today think of chocolate as something sweet to eat or drink and can be easily found in stores around the world. It might surprise you that chocolate was once highly treasured. The wealthy people of Spain first enjoyed a sweetened chocolate drink. Later, the popularity of the drink spread throughout Europe. Chocolate remained a drink that only wealthy people could afford to drink until the eighteenth century. During the period known as the Industrial Revolution, new technologies helped make chocolate less costly to produce. Farmers grow cacao trees in many countries in Africa, Central and South America, but these trees are difficult to grow. They require an exact amount of water, warmth, soil and protection. After about five years, cacao trees start producing large fruits called pods, which grow near the trunk of the tree. The seeds inside these pods are harvested to make chocolate.
