Others say that the opposite is true: that international contests encourage false national pride and lead to misunderstanding and hatred. There is probably some truth in both arguments, but in recent years the Olympic Games have done little to support the view that sport encourages international brotherhood.

One country received its second - place medal with great anger after the hockey final. There had been noisy scenes at the end of the hockey match, the losers objecting to the final decisions. They were certain that one of their goals should not have been dismissed and that the opposite side's victory was unfair. Their manager was angry when he said: \"This wasn't hockey. Hockey and the International Hockey Society are finished. \"The president of the society said later that such words could result in the pause of the team for at least three years.

The American players then decided not to receive the silver medals.   Incidents of this kind will continue as long as sport is played for honors or money rather than for the love of the game.

Clinical death occurs when the vital organs, such as the heart or lungs, have ceased to function, but have not suffered permanent damage. The organism can still be revived .

The best method developed so far involves cooling of the organism, combined with narcotic sleep. By slowing down the body's metabolism , cooling delays the processes leading to biological death. To illustrate how this works, scientists performed an experiment on a six-year-old female monkey called Keta. The scientist put Keta to sleep with a narcotic. Then they surrounded her body with ice-bags and began checking her body temperature. When it had dropped to 28 degrees the scientists began draining blood from an artery. The monkey's blood pressure decreased and an hour later both the heart and breathing stopped: clinical death set in. For twenty minutes Keta remained in this state. Her temperature dropped to 22 degrees. At this point the scientists pumped blood into an artery in the direction of the heart and started artificial breathing. After two minutes Keta's heart became active once more. After fifteen minutes, spontaneous breathing began, and after four hours Keta opened her eyes and lifted her head.

Modern scientists divide the process of dying into two phases --- clinical or temporary death and biological death. Clinical death occurs when the vital organs, such as the heart or lungs, have ceased to function, but have not suffered permanent damage. The organism can still be revived . Biological death occurs when changes in the organism lead to the \"breaking up\" of vital cells and tissues. Death is then unchangeable and final. Scientists have been seeking a way to prolong the period of clinical death so that the organism can remain alive before biological death occurs. The best method developed so far involves cooling of the organism, combined with narcotic sleep. By slowing down the body's metabolism , cooling delays the processes leading to biological death. To illustrate how this works, scientists performed an experiment on a six-year-old female monkey called Keta. The scientist put Keta to sleep with a narcotic. Then they surrounded her body with ice-bags and began checking her body temperature. When it had dropped to 28 degrees the scientists began draining blood from an artery.

Time management is not necessarily working harder, but quicker and more smartly. Sometimes our mistakes will keep us from running at a full pace. Here are the top four Time Management mistakes we should all avoid to help us to increase our daily success. a. Start your day without a plan of action in the morning. If so, you will have worked hard but may not have done enough of right things. Time Management is not doing the wrong things.  b. Work with a messy desk or work area. Studies have shown that the person who works with a messy desk spends one and a half hours per day looking for things. If you have ever visited the office of a top manager who is working with a clean desk, you will find that the manager works efficiently . c. Don't get enough sleep. Studies show that nearly 75% of the people around us complain about not having  enough sleep, and then throughout their days they are tired. For most people, they get the quantity of sleep, but they lack the quality of sleep. Their days are filled with so much stress; they are out of control, working harder but maybe not more smartly, so it's difficult for them to get a full night's sleep.  d. Don't take a lunch break.

{"answer": 2, "choices": ["One.", "Two.", "Three.", "Four."], "question": "Sigmund Freud was one of the first scientists to make serious research of the mind. The mind is the collection of activities based in the brain that involve how we act, think, feel and reason. He used long talks with patients and the study of dreams to search for the causes of mental and emotional problems. He also tried hypnosis . He wanted to see whether putting patients into a sleep-like condition would help ease troubled minds. In most cases he found the effects only temporary. Freud worked hard, although what he did might sound easy. His method involved sitting with his patients and listening to them talk. He had them talk about whatever they were thinking. All ideas, thoughts and anything that entered their mind had to be expressed. There could be no holding back because of fear or guilt. Freud believed that all the painful memories of childhood lay buried in the unconscious self. This part of the mind he said contains wishes, desires and experiences too frightening to recognize. He thought that if these memories could somehow be brought into the conscious mind, the patient would again feel the pain. But this time, the person would experience them as an adult. The patient would feel them, be able to examine them and, if successful, finally understand them. Using this way, Freud reasoned, the pain and emotional pressure of the past would be greatly weakened. They would lose their hold over the person's physical health. Soon the patient would get better. Many of Freud's theories about how the mind works also had strong sexual connections. These included what he saw as the repressed feelings of sons toward their mothers and daughters toward their fathers. If nothing else, Freud's ideas were revolutionary. Some people rejected them.

You might see that many stars look larger than others. You might see that some stars that look white are really red or blue. With bigger and bigger telescope you can see more and more objects in the sky. And you can see those objects in more and more detail. But scientists believe there are some things in the sky that we will never see. We won't see them with the biggest telescope in the world, on the clearest night of the year. That's because they're invisible. They're the mysterious dead stars called black holes. You might find it hard to imagine that stars die. After all, our Sun is a star. Year after year we see it up in the sky, burning brightly, giving us heat and light. The Sun certainly doesn't seem to be getting old or weak. But stars do burn out and die after billions of years. As a star's gases burn, they give off light and heat. But when the gas runs out, the star stops burning and begins to die. As the star cools, the outer layers of the star pull in toward the center. The star squashes  into a smaller and smaller ball. If the star was very small, the star ends up as a cold, dark ball called a black dwarf. If the star was very big, it keeps squashing inward until it's packed together tighter than anything in the universe. Imagine if the Earth were crushed  until it was the size of a tiny marble . That's how tightly this dead star, a black hole, is packed. What pulls the star in towards its center with such power? It's the same force that pulls you down when you jump - the force called gravity. A black hole is so tightly packed that its gravity sucks in everything - even light. The light from a black hole can never come back to your eyes. That's why you see nothing but blackness.

{"answer": 1, "choices": ["Most black holes are so far away.", "Because the gravity of a black hole is so strong that it sucks the light inward.", "Because as the star's gases burn, it stops giving off heat and light.", "Because as a star cools, its outer layers pull in toward its center."], "question": "How many things can you see in the night sky? A lot! On a clear night you might see the Moon, some planets, and thousands of sparkling stars. You can see even more with a telescope. You might see stars where before you only saw dark space. You might see that many stars look larger than others. You might see that some stars that look white are really red or blue. With bigger and bigger telescope you can see more and more objects in the sky. And you can see those objects in more and more detail. But scientists believe there are some things in the sky that we will never see. We won't see them with the biggest telescope in the world, on the clearest night of the year. That's because they're invisible. They're the mysterious dead stars called black holes. You might find it hard to imagine that stars die. After all, our Sun is a star. Year after year we see it up in the sky, burning brightly, giving us heat and light. The Sun certainly doesn't seem to be getting old or weak. But stars do burn out and die after billions of years. As a star's gases burn, they give off light and heat. But when the gas runs out, the star stops burning and begins to die. As the star cools, the outer layers of the star pull in toward the center. The star squashes  into a smaller and smaller ball. If the star was very small, the star ends up as a cold, dark ball called a black dwarf. If the star was very big, it keeps squashing inward until it's packed together tighter than anything in the universe. Imagine if the Earth were crushed  until it was the size of a tiny marble . That's how tightly this dead star, a black hole, is packed. What pulls the star in towards its center with such power? It's the same force that pulls you down when you jump - the force called gravity. A black hole is so tightly packed that its gravity sucks in everything - even light. The light from a black hole can never come back to your eyes. That's why you see nothing but blackness. So the next time you stare up at the night sky, remember: there's more in the sky than meets the eyes! Scattered  in the silent darkness are black holes - the great mystery of space. Why can't you see light when you look at a black hole?", "subject": ""}

The idea of spending two months in Argentine was exciting. Then I began having second thoughts. I had never been far from New England, and I had been homesick my first few weeks at college. What would it be like in a strange country? What about the language? The more I thought about it, the more the idea worried me.  In the end I turned down the invitation. As soon as Ted asked somebody else to go, I began kicking myself. I had turned down something I wanted to do because I was scared, and had ended up feeling depressed. That unhappy summer taught me a valuable lesson out of which I developed a rule for myself: do what makes you anxious; don't do what makes you depressed.  At the end of my senior year, I began to think about becoming a writer. But my professor was urging me to aim at teaching. I hesitated. The idea of trying to live by writing was a lot scarier than spending a summer in Argentina. Back and forth I went, making my decision, unmaking it. Suddenly I realized that every time I gave up the idea of writing, that downhearted feeling went through me. Giving up on what I really wanted to do depressed me. Right then I learned another lesson. To avoid that kind of depression meant having to bear a certain amount of worry and concern. When I first began writing articles, I was frequently required to interview big names. Before each interview I would get butterflies in the stomach and my hands would shake. One person I particularly admired was the great composer Duke Ellington. On the stage and on television, he seemed the very model of confidence. Then I learned Ellington still got stage fright. If the highly honored Ellington, who had appeared on the bandstand some 10,000 times over 30years, had anxiety attacks, who was I to think I could avoid them? I went on doing those frightening interviews. Then I realized to my astonishment that I was even looking forward to the interviews. What had happened to those butterflies? Well, in truth, they were still there, but there were fewer of them. I had benefited, I discovered, from a process psychologists call \"extinction\". If you put an individual in an anxious situation often enough, he will eventually learn that there isn't anything to be worried about, which brings me to a conclusion: you'll never get rid of anxiety by avoiding the things that caused it.

{"answer": 2, "choices": ["The prediction of economists.", "The situation of economy", "The increase of oil price", "The American response to high price"], "question": "A couple of years ago, those who forecast that oil price would reach $ 100 a barrel were seen as doomsters. However, now some are predicting $ 200 a barrel. Had economists been told that oil price would barely pause at $ 100 before reaching the recent peak of nearly $ 127, they would no doubt have forecast terrible economic consequences. But the global economy, though interrupted by the high price of energy, is still chugging along. Meanwhile, inflation has picked up, but the headlinerates of inflation  in most developed countries are nowhere near the levels seen in the 1970s and 1980s. There are three explanations for the oil price's unclear impact. The first is that nowadays developed economies are more efficient in their use of energy, thanks partly to the increased importance of service industries and the diminished role of manufacturing . According to the Energy Information Administration, the energy intensity of America's GDP fell by 42% between 1980 and 2007. A second theory is that the oil-price rise has been steady, not sudden, giving the economy time to adjust. Giovanni Serio of Goldman Sachs points out that in 1973 there was a severe supply shock because of the oil embargo , when the world had to cope with 10%-15% less crude almost overnight. Not this time. The third explanation turns the argument on its head; rather than oil harming the global economy, it is global expansion that is driving up the price of oil. The most important factor is the shift in favor of the developing economies. America has responded to high price in familiar fashion: UBS forecasts that demand will drop by 1.1% this year and will be no higher in 2010 than it was in 2004. But the demand from China and other emerging markets is more than offsetting  this shortfall. What is the passage mainly talking about?", "subject": ""}

There are three explanations for the oil price's unclear impact. The first is that nowadays developed economies are more efficient in their use of energy, thanks partly to the increased importance of service industries and the diminished role of manufacturing . According to the Energy Information Administration, the energy intensity of America's GDP fell by 42% between 1980 and 2007. A second theory is that the oil-price rise has been steady, not sudden, giving the economy time to adjust. Giovanni Serio of Goldman Sachs points out that in 1973 there was a severe supply shock because of the oil embargo , when the world had to cope with 10%-15% less crude almost overnight. Not this time. The third explanation turns the argument on its head; rather than oil harming the global economy, it is global expansion that is driving up the price of oil. The most important factor is the shift in favor of the developing economies. America has responded to high price in familiar fashion: UBS forecasts that demand will drop by 1.1% this year and will be no higher in 2010 than it was in 2004. But the demand from China and other emerging markets is more than offsetting  this shortfall. How many explanations for the oil price's impact are mentioned in the passage?", "subject": ""}

I would like to take a few minutes to address a few concerns that I have with the United States. First of all, I would like to address the war. In my opinion, we should have never been involved with Iraq to the extent that we are now. I believe we should pull our troops out. However, I think there should be a time table that we follow but the time table should not be released  because the enemy does not need to know when we are going to pull out. Also, the war takes out a ton of our money, which leads me to my next issue. The economy right now, in the opinion of many Americans is the biggest issue with which we are facing right now. No one can predict what will happen one day or the next. The obvious thing to do is to put 700 billion dollars in the economy, but that bill failed and was rejected by the House of Representatives . Instead of putting 700 billion dollars in, I think the money should be equally distributed among Americans to pay off their debts. I'm not sure if this would work, but I think it is a positive alternative  we could take. My final issue I would like to call to your attention is teacher's salaries. The high school students of today are America's future. In a way, America's future depends greatly on the high school teachers of America. Saying this, it is sad that teacher's salaries are where they are. While teachers are working harder and harder every day to teach high school students, CEO's of big companies that are driving our countries economy into the ground are getting bonuses. I'm not saying that teacher's salaries should be the same of CEO's of companies, but I do strongly believe that action should be taken to increase the salaries of teachers because they have one of the most important jobs in America - - preparing our country for the future.

Facebook then attempts to make money by selling their data  to advertisers that want to send targeted  messages. Most Facebook users don't realize this is happening. Even if they know what the company is up to, they still have no idea what they're paying for Facebook, because people don't really know what their personal details are worth. The biggest problem, however, is that the company keeps changing the rules. Early on, you could keep everything private. That was the great thing about Facebook--you could create your own little private network. Last year, the company changed its privacy rules so that many things--your city, your photo, your friends' names--were set, by default , to be shared with everyone on the Internet.

He clocked an excellent 12.91 seconds to equal the world record set by Britain's Collin Jackson in 1993. It is the first gold Chinese men's athlete has ever won from the track and field in the Olympics history. China has won over 100 gold medals from the summer Olympic Games since 1984 but its male athletes only got one medal from Olympics' most popular sport, the track and field. The Shanghai native, with his father a truck driver and mother an out-of-work housewife, loved sports when he was very little. Liu was selected to the Junior Sports School of Putuo District of Shanghai to practice jumping as a fourth grader in the primary school. But after a bone test showing that he will not be able to become a tall man, Liu was asked to give up sports one year later, although he had won the national champion at that level. In 1998 when he attracted coach Sun Haiping's attention as a 15-year-old jumper, Sun was a well-known hurdle coach and he believed a star was born at the first sight of Liu. He visited Liu's parents several times and finally persuaded them to let Liu transfer to the 110m hurdles. After only three years, Liu launched his career in style in the IAAF Grand Prix in Lausanne in 2001 by breaking the world youth and Asian record with a time of 13.12. But the first warning he sent to the world was his bronze-winning feat at the world indoor championships in Birmingham, England, last year. In 2004, Liu won the silver in the world indoor championships in Budapest in March. Two months later, he proved the winner in a race against American great Allen Johnson in the IAAF Grand Prix in Osaka, Japan, where he clocked a new Asian record and world's season best time of 13.06 seconds. He went on to win two Johnson-absent races in Lille, France, on June 26 and Zagreb, Croatia, three days later. He put up an exciting show at the Golden Gala meet in Rome on July 3, when he and Johnson clocked an identical time of 13.11. Race officials had to examine a photo finish to declare Johnson the winner. Liu did a better job of clearing the hurdles than Johnson, but Johnson's stronger start ended up making the difference. The race boosted  Liu's optimism  for the Olympics, although Johnson bettered his season best time by 0.01 second in Lausanne, Switzerland, on July 6. The world has put the Olympics a Johnson-Liu but surprisingly Johnson crashed out of the Games after falling at the ninth hurdle at round 2. Johnson's early exit paved the way for Liu's win.

But don't worry, they're not mad, it's all part of a biennial fund-raising event called Red Nose Day. Organized by the charity Comic Relief, founded in 1985 by two British comedians, the aim of the event is to raise money to fight poverty and injustice in the UK and Africa. Celebrities and public figures support the event by making appearances on comic TV shows broadcast by the BBC. This year, for example, UK Prime Minister David Cameron appeared in a music video by One Direction, which the band produced for the event. But Britons don't just raise money for charitable causes on one day a year, they do it all year round. One way of doing so is by shopping in charity shops. These small, inconspicuous shops sell clothes, books and household goods just like any other shop. But there's one big difference--it's all secondhand. There are nearly 10,000 charity shops in the UK, according to the Charity Retail Association. Their business model is simple: Anybody who has things they don't want anymore can donate them to a charity shop, where they are checked for damage, cleaned and priced. Most items go back on sale at a small part of their original price and the money that is made by selling them is used for a charitable cause. The idea of buying used clothes may sound off-putting, but for shoppers who have less spending money, such as the elderly or those in low-paying jobs, it has been a welcome option for years. Now, \"thrifting\"--shopping at charity shops-- is also becoming popular with young people looking for alternative fashion. \"I love shopping at thrift stores. You can find very unique clothes for a very cheap price. It doesn't bother me that other people may have worn them, I simply wash them before I wear them,\" said Anne Marie, a 19-year-old Internet user from the US, in a comment on a Yahoo forum.

This may sound a little ridiculous at first. But try to think of a time when you were extremely nervous. Chances are that you also felt uncomfortable in your stomach, didn't you? This is probably why people use the idiom \"butterflies in one's stomach\" to refer to being nervous. Now scientists from Canada and the US have found that our guts  , if not as bright as our actual brains, are much more than just where we digest the food we eat. They also affect our emotions and even behavior, all thanks to the bacteria in them, reported Scientific American. In the study, scientists fed timid mice stomach bacteria from mice that were more active and daring. After eating the bacteria, the timid mice grew more energetic and fearless.

When Italian designer Arturo Vittori and Swiss architect Andreas Vogler first visited Ethiopia in 2012,they were shocked to see women and children forced to walk miles to access what,for them,had always been within easy reach,water. Only 34 percent of Ethiopians have access to a reliable water supply.Some travel for up to six hours a day to fetch some or,even worse,have to use pond water polluted by human waste, _ the spread of disease. Worldwide,about 768 million people--two and a half times the U.S.population--don't have access to safe drinking water.So just imagine if we could just pull water out of thin air?That's what Vittori and Vogler asked once they saw the severe problem and promised to take action.Their firm,Architecture and Vision,has since come up with Warka Water,a grand palm-like structure that may look like something you'd see in a modern art museum,but it's been designed to harvest water from the air. Warka Water,which is named after an Ethiopian fig tree,is composed of a 30-foot bamboo frame containing a fog-harvesting nylon net that can catch water easily,can be easily lowered for repairs and allow communities to measure the water level.Collecting water through condensation is hardly a new technique,but the creators of Warka Water say their tree-inspired design is more effective,maximizing surface and perfecting every angle to produce up to 26 gallons of drinkable water a day--enough for a family of seven. Western organizations have been working to provide clean water access in Africa for decades,so Warka Water joins a very long list of earlier attempts.So far,high-tech solutions,like the once promising Playpump,have failed,mostly due to high costs and maintenance issues. This is where Warka Water stands apart--a lower-tech solution that is easy to repair and far more affordable than digging wells in the rocky Ethiopian plateau.

Our lives are full of them, from the small ones to the life-changing. The right to choose is central to everyone. Yet sometimes we make bad decisions that leave us unhappy or full of regret. Can science help? Most of us know little about the mental processes that lie behind our decisions. Luckily, what psychologists are finding may help us all make better choices. Here are some of their amazing discoveries to help you make up your mind. Consider your emotions. You might think that emotions are the enemy of decision making, but in fact they're a part of it. Whenever you make up your mind, your brain's emotional center is active. University of Southern California scientist, Antonio Damasio, has studied people with damage to only the emotional parts of their brains, and found that they were unable to make basic choices about what to wear or eat. Damasio thinks this may be because our brains store emotional memories of past choices, which we use to help the present decision making. However, making choices under the influence of an emotion can greatly affect the result. Take anger, for example. A study by Nitika Garg of the University of Mississippi and other scientists found the angry shoppers were more likely to choose the first thing they were offered rather than considering other choices. It seems anger can lead us to make quick decisions without much thinking. All emotions affect our thinking and motivation , so it may be best to avoid making important decisions under their influence. Yet strangely there's one emotion that seems to help us make good choices. The American researchers found that sad people took time to consider the various choices on offer, and ended up making the best choices. In fact many studies show that people who feel unhappy have the most reasonable view of the world. According to the text, what may help us make better decisions?", "subject": ""}

But she could not support her family with the money she earned. So she moved to New York City where the pay was higher. She left her daughter in Baltimore with one of her distant relatives. The young girl Eleanora Fagan changed her name to Billie, because she liked a movie star, Billie Dove. The talented Billie Holiday loved singing. She sang and listened  to music whenever she could. In one place near her home there was a machine that played records. The building was a theater where many famous singers also performed their newly-made songs for free. Billie cleaned floors and did other jobs for the theater so that she could listen to the records. It was there that young Billie first heard the records of some famous black American blues artists of the 1920s. she heard Bessie Smith sing the blues. And she heard Louis Armstrong play the horn. Both musicians had a great influence on her. Billie Holiday once said, \"I do not think I'm singing. I feel like I am playing a horn. _ I hate straight singing.

Proponents say that it's simple economics -- if it's free to pollute, you'll get a lot of pollution. Opponents claim it will raise the cost of energy that's produced from high carbon sources, like coal. But here's the secret that most people seem to be missing: There already is a price on carbon, and it's paid by the taxpayers. Carbon pollution, like every other form of pollution, has an impact on the environment. Throwing waste into a river will cause the fish to die and the people who drink the water to get sick.  And when you produce carbon pollution, you get climate change -- sea level rise, stronger storms, severe droughts, damage to agriculture, and more. All of those impacts cost money. Insurance rates go up when storms get more destructive. Taxes increase when cities have to rebuild bridges and roads. Military budgets go up when droughts and population changes cause conflicts. Not to mention impacts on agriculture and health care costs. In other words, the price on carbon is what we all pay when there is no market force to limit the pollution that causes climate change. So the debate is really about who will pay that price -- the companies who are making a profit from the fossil fuels, or the taxpayers who pick up the cost now? Right now, we have private profit and public cost. It's just like if we allowed every business to throw its garbage in the street because it's too expensive to have it moved away properly. Does it add a little bit to your dinner check to require that restaurants dispose of their trash properly? Sure. But it would be more expensive for you if the city had to clean the streets of their garbage every day. So just like we put a \"price on garbage\" we need a \"price on carbon pollution.\" Now, a \"price on carbon pollution\" can mean a lot of things. You could tax companies based on the amount of carbon pollution they produce, and return the money to taxpayers.

Burning crops is becoming more popular because it is good for the planet.Doing so is also cheaper than burning fossil fuels.As more land is devoted to non-food crop production, the economics of crops for fuel are likely to become even more favorable. Humans have been burning such biomass--organic materials from plants or animals-- since they discovered fire.But that burning fossil fuels could have catastrophic consequences has brought biomass back into fashion. Even allowing for emissions   of carbon dioxide from fuel used in planting, harvesting, processing and transporting biomass fuel, replacing fossil fuel with biomass can typically reduce greenhouse gas emissions by more than 90 percent. Power stations around the world are experimenting with forms of biomass to add to their coal or oil, with encouraging results.Indeed, power companies could profit by turning to biomass, especially when the subsidies   many governments offer for using renewable energy are taken into account. Farmers can benefit from growing biomass.In Europe, the reduction of subsidies for certain crops is exposing farmers to market forces.Instead of being paid for whatever they produce, farmers must seek a clear demand for their product.Many believe that the demand for alternatives to fossil fuels could be just such a driver. But while biomass offers a variety of potential alternatives, the world's infrastructure   has developed around burning fossil fuels to such a stage that switching to biomass involves a change in conception that many companies have not accepted. Also, there are problems with using biomass.Although most coal-fired power stations could take a small amount of their fuel from biomass without significant adjustment, few are built to run on biomass alone.Burning some forms of biomass also causes environmental problems.Oils and waste can be smelly, while wood produces smoke unless burned properly. The supply chains for fossil fuels are set up well, but those for biomass are just the beginning. Sources of supply for biomass rely on farm production and can therefore be less reliable. They are necessarily limited and it wouldn't make sense to turn a very large amount of valuable agricultural land away from food crops.But as the world adjusts to the need to control greenhouse gas emissions, these problems may receive more attention.

Even allowing for emissions   of carbon dioxide from fuel used in planting, harvesting, processing and transporting biomass fuel, replacing fossil fuel with biomass can typically reduce greenhouse gas emissions by more than 90 percent. Power stations around the world are experimenting with forms of biomass to add to their coal or oil, with encouraging results.Indeed, power companies could profit by turning to biomass, especially when the subsidies   many governments offer for using renewable energy are taken into account. Farmers can benefit from growing biomass.In Europe, the reduction of subsidies for certain crops is exposing farmers to market forces.Instead of being paid for whatever they produce, farmers must seek a clear demand for their product.Many believe that the demand for alternatives to fossil fuels could be just such a driver.

{"answer": 2, "choices": ["make a snowman", "throw snowballs", "go skating", "go skiing"], "question": "Years ago there was a group of kids who would hang around at some local ponds  in the woods near their houses in Warwick, Rhode Island. In summer they caught frogs and fish. When winter arrived they couldn't wait to go skating. Time passed, and the ponds became the only open space for the kids to enjoy themselves in that neighborhood. One day a thirteen-year-old boy from this group of kids read in the local newspaper that a developer wanted to fill in the ponds and build over a hundred small houses called apartments. So the boy went door to door and gathered more than two hundred signatures to stop the development. A group of citizens met and decided to support him. At the meeting of the town planning organization,the boy was quite nervous at first and spoke very softly.

{"answer": 1, "choices": ["Short history", "Individual efforts", "Political influences", "Language translation"], "question": "BEIJING --- Since Mo Yan won the Nobel Prize in Literature, the public has started to consider the way to improve Chinese literature's global presence. The prize indicates that Chinese contemporary authors and their works are getting the world's attention, which inspires writers and amateurs to continue their work, according to Wang Meng, a famous Chinese writer. But \"the prize came a little late,\" said Xue Yongwu, dean of the College of Liberal Arts, Journalism and Communication with Ocean University of China (OUC). There have been many accomplished writers of modern and contemporary literature in China, including Lu Xun, Ba Jin and Mao Dun, who should have won the prize earlier, he noted. China's splendid ancient literature, which extends thousands of years, has been widely acknowledged across the world. However, the contemporary literature failed to get enough recognition from outside the country due to its short history and complex political influences, he explained. Language has also been a barrier. Only a small proportion of Chinese literature has been translated into foreign languages, mainly English. The quality of some translated editions needs improvement, said Xue.  In addition to language skills, translation requires high-level comprehension and explanation of culture and art. It's hard for people without any literature background to produce a translation that fully reserves the aesthetic  sense of the original version, according to Ren Dongsheng, professor with the College of Foreign Languages of OUC. The 57-year-old writer is known for his description of Chinese rural life. The settings for his works range from the 1911 revolution, Japan's invasion to Cultural Revolution. Mo combines hallucinatory  realism with folk tales, which is more appealing to the taste of Western readers than the styles adopted by many of his peers, such as Yu Hua, Su Tong and Wang Shuo, said Zhang Hongsheng, dean of the Literature Department of the Communication University of China.       However, \"Nobel Prize is not the unique standard to judge the achievements of a writer. Prizes presented by different organizations adopt various evaluation criteria,\" said Xu Yan, a literature critic. The quality of a literary work is always judged by the topic, language, structure, the way of story-telling, imagination and some other significant elements. People's tastes vary from different social background and cultural mechanism, she added.     Chinese contemporary literature, which appeared in 1949, has seen a trend of diversification since the country adopted the market economy in 1992. \"The prize is a positive sign that the West begins to recognize Chinese literature. But it's an acknowledgement of individual efforts, and Chinese literature revival still has a long way to go,\" said Zhang. Xue called upon Chinese writers to produce quality works with international perspectives. Good literature should reveal social problems and people's concerns while create the beauty of art. \"The society should provide favorable environment for the growth of Chinese writers,\" he stressed. Seeking increasing world attention requires Chinese writers to maintain the national characteristics and uniqueness. \"Chinese elements are the last to lose in successful writings,\" Zhang said.     China's book market has witnessed booming sales of Mo's masterpieces over the past days. Zhicheng Classic Bookstore, registered at T-Mall of China's largest online retailer Taobao.com, said 1,500 volumes of Mo's latest novel Frog were sold out in six hours after Mo won the prize. The store has received 1,200 reservation orders by 3:30 pm Friday. The book, about China's family-planning policy, also moved up to 14th from 560th on the list of the most populous book at the Amazon.cn withinin two days. Cao Yuanyong, deputy editor-in-chief of Shanghai Literature and Art Publishing Group, said the company is producing the new edition of a collection of Mo's 16 works, which is expected to refill the empty shelves of many book retailers in a week.

{"answer": 2, "choices": ["International characteristics", "International perspectives", "Chinese elements", "Favorable environment"], "question": "BEIJING --- Since Mo Yan won the Nobel Prize in Literature, the public has started to consider the way to improve Chinese literature's global presence. The prize indicates that Chinese contemporary authors and their works are getting the world's attention, which inspires writers and amateurs to continue their work, according to Wang Meng, a famous Chinese writer. But \"the prize came a little late,\" said Xue Yongwu, dean of the College of Liberal Arts, Journalism and Communication with Ocean University of China (OUC). There have been many accomplished writers of modern and contemporary literature in China, including Lu Xun, Ba Jin and Mao Dun, who should have won the prize earlier, he noted. China's splendid ancient literature, which extends thousands of years, has been widely acknowledged across the world. However, the contemporary literature failed to get enough recognition from outside the country due to its short history and complex political influences, he explained. Language has also been a barrier. Only a small proportion of Chinese literature has been translated into foreign languages, mainly English. The quality of some translated editions needs improvement, said Xue.  In addition to language skills, translation requires high-level comprehension and explanation of culture and art. It's hard for people without any literature background to produce a translation that fully reserves the aesthetic  sense of the original version, according to Ren Dongsheng, professor with the College of Foreign Languages of OUC. The 57-year-old writer is known for his description of Chinese rural life. The settings for his works range from the 1911 revolution, Japan's invasion to Cultural Revolution. Mo combines hallucinatory  realism with folk tales, which is more appealing to the taste of Western readers than the styles adopted by many of his peers, such as Yu Hua, Su Tong and Wang Shuo, said Zhang Hongsheng, dean of the Literature Department of the Communication University of China.       However, \"Nobel Prize is not the unique standard to judge the achievements of a writer. Prizes presented by different organizations adopt various evaluation criteria,\" said Xu Yan, a literature critic. The quality of a literary work is always judged by the topic, language, structure, the way of story-telling, imagination and some other significant elements. People's tastes vary from different social background and cultural mechanism, she added.     Chinese contemporary literature, which appeared in 1949, has seen a trend of diversification since the country adopted the market economy in 1992. \"The prize is a positive sign that the West begins to recognize Chinese literature.

Yang Yuting, chief language training tutor at Amber Education, an overseas education consulting agency, said there have been a few cases in which candidates' IELTS results were canceled in recent years, leaving the students with no qualification but this is the first time he has heard that results, including those of some of his students, were\"withheld permanently\", meaning IELTS will not give the students their results, nor will they give them to others. Wang Xin, a senior student at the Communication University of China in Beijing, took an IELTS test on August 1 and the results were due within 10 working days. But she was then informed that her results were undergoing routine checks. Soon after that, she received an e-mail telling her that\"a decision has been made to withhold this result permanently\"and stating that Wang had\"breached  IELTS test rules and regulations\". A number of students who took the test during the past two months in cities including Nanjing, Changsha and Guangzhou, have had the same experience. Many test takers said they were confused because they didn't know how they had breached the rules and regulations. IELTS authorities said in an e-mail toChinaDailythat IELTS takes the responsibility of providing test results very seriously.

The Millennium Seed Bank Project, run by Kew Gardens--one of the oldest botanical   gardens--will officially place the 24,200th species on Thursday, a pink, wild banana from China. More than 50 countries are now on board with Kew's giant task but vast places of the globe, including India and Brazil, still need to join in and donate seeds, director Paul Smith said. The seed bank is one of the largest and most diverse  in the world with more than 1.5 billion seeds. Its goal is to help protect the planet's bio-diversity during a time of climate change. The wild banana seed is under threat of extinction  in southwest China from agricultural development. It is a vital food source for Asian elephants and important for growing bananas for human eating. Stored at minus-20 degrees centigrade, so they can last for thousands of years, the seeds await the day that scientists hope never comes--when the species no longer exist in the wild. It is a race against time, Smith said, because in the last ten years alone, 20 plants held in the bank have already been wiped out in the wild. He estimates that between a third and a quarter will become extinct this century. \"It is pressing and it is happening now. An area, the size of England, is cleared of primary vegetation every year.\" Smith said. Because most of the world's food and medicines come from nature, protecting wild plant species is quite important, scientists say. There are already many other seed banks safeguarding food crops, which only account for 0.6 percent of plant diversity.

The German battleship   Bismarck, the most powerful warship in the world, was moving out into the Atlantic Ocean. Her task: to destroy the ships carrying supplies   from the United States to war-torn England. The British had feared such a task. No warship they had could match the Bismarck in speed or in firepower. The Bismarck had eight 15-inch guns and 81 smaller guns. She could move at 30 nautical miles   an hour. She was believed to be unsinkable. However, the British had to sink her. They sent out a task force headed by their best battleship Hood to hunt down the Bismarck. On May 24, the Hood found the Bismarck. It was a meeting that the German commander Luetjens did not want to see. His orders were to destroy the British ships that were carrying supplies, but to stay away from a fight with British warships. The battle didn't last long. The Bismarck's first torpedo   hit the Hood, which went down taking all but three of her 1,419 men with her. But in the fight, the Bismarck was a bit damaged. Her commander decided to run for repairs to France, which had at that time been taken by the Germans. The British force followed her. However, because of the Bismarck's speed and the heavy fog, they lost sight of her. For two days, every British ship in the Atlantic tried to find the Bismarck, but with no success.

According to a new study by researchers at the University of Georgia, such people may be more likely to have food addiction. The study found that people exhibiting impulsive behavior weren't necessarily overweight, but impulsiveness was related to a direct relationship with food, and therefore, less healthy weight. Food addiction has been compared to addictive drug use. Studies have linked the dopamine   release that occurs after tasting delicious food to the dopamine release that happens when people consume other addictive substances. Impulsive behavior involves several personality traits  . Two of these traits, known as negative urgency and lack of perseverance, were particularly associated with food addiction and high BMI   during the study. Negative urgency is characterized by the tendency to behave impulsively when experiencing negative emotions. Some people might drink alcohol or take drugs. For others, it could mean eating to feel better. Lack of perseverance is when a person has a hard time finishing hard or boring tasks. People with a lack of perseverance might have difficulty attempting to change addictive eating behavior, which could also cause obesity. \"Impulsiveness might be one reason why some people eat in an addictive way despite motivation to lose weight,\" said Dr. Ashley Gearhardt, a clinical psychologist. He was involved in developing the Yale Food Addiction Scale in aid of those people. \"We are theorizing that if food addiction is really a thing, then our measure, the Yale Food Addiction Scale, should be related to helping control impulsive action,\" said Gearhardt. Clinical psychologist Dr. James MacKillop, whose lab was conducting the study, believes that therapies used to treat addictive drug behavior could help people who suffer from addictive eating habits. \"Most of the programs for weight loss at this point focus on the most obvious things, which are clearly diet and exercise,\" MacKillop said. \"It seems that managing strong desires to eat would naturally fit in with the skills a person would need to eat healthily.\" What can be inferred about the Yale Food Addiction Scale from the text?", "subject": ""}

Scientists know that smells can make people think of powerful memories. Wouldn't it be great to somehow save those memories?      _ is exactly what Mark Crames, a businessman making perfumes  , is trying to do. His company, Demeter Fragrance, makes more than 200 kinds of perfumes. \"Imagine every smell in the world as a musical note,\" Crames said. \"We try to join those notes to make a piece of beautiful music.\" He has made many perfumes and he got the idea from plays, storms and even animals.

Roebling convinced (persuade sb. to do sth. ) his son, Washington, an up-and-coming engineer, that the bridge could be built. The two of them formed an idea of how it could be finished successfully and how to overcome the difficulties. Somehow, they persuaded bankers to provide money for the project. Then, with great excitement and energy, they hired their crew and began to build their dream bridge. The project was only a few months _ when a tragic on-site accident killed John Roebling and severely injured his son. Washington was severely brain-damaged, unable to talk or walk. Everyone thought the project would have to be thrown away, since the Roeblings were the only ones who understood how the bridge could be built. Though Washington Roebling was unable to move or talk, his mind was as sharp as ever. One day as he lay in his hospital bed, an idea flashed in his mind as to how to develop a communication code. All he could move was one finger, so he touched the arm of his wife with that finger.

Some companies have also delay new oil drilling and exploration projects. The drop in oil prices has also affected small service companies and even stores that do business with oil companies in big producer states like Texas. But the drop in oil prices has not been bad for everyone.  Oil platform workers are often called roughnecks. In Texas, many roughnecks have lost their jobs because of the drop in oil prices. The effect of falling prices has been worse in states like Alaska and North Dakota. That is because production costs are higher there than they are in the Eagle Ford area of south-central Texas.  Adam Perdue is an economist at the University of Houston's Institute for Regional Forecasting. He has been studying the effect of falling oil prices in Texas. He says oil company exploration and production budgets  are being cut between 10 and 50 percent, with most of them being cut by a third. He thinks the lower spending will affect the local economy. The economic slowdown will affect companies that manufacture pipes and other equipment for oil exploration and production. It will also have an effect on trucking companies that supply sand and chemicals, and other small businesses that serve the energy industry. But low oil prices are good for chemical companies. They use hydrocarbons  found in oil to make fertilizer, plastic and other products.

When he resurfaced, it was evident that the man was not out for gold - his arms were waving in an attempt at freestyle. The crowd started to laugh. Clearly this man was not a medal competitor. I listened to the crowd begin to laugh at this poor man who was clearly having a hard time. Finally he made his turn to start back. It was pitiful. He made a few desperate strokes and you could tell he was worn out. But in those few awful strokes, the crowd had changed. No longer were they laughing, but beginning to cheer. Some even began to stand and shout \"Come on, you can do it!\" and he did. A clear minute past the average swimmer, this young man finally finished his race. The crowd went wild. You would have thought that he had won the gold, and he should have. Even though he recorded one of the slowest times in Olympic history, this man gave more heart than any of the other competitors. Just a short year ago, he had never even swum, let alone race. His country had been invited to Sydney.

Surely, a computing purse and scarf set may seem like the stuff of science fiction. But these devices, part of next generation of wearable computers, could become commonplace within a few years.

{"answer": 3, "choices": ["All the subjects went through all the 3 experiments.", "Stellar carefully chose 300 college students according their personal income level.", "The rich really lacks the ability to feel pity for the poor.", "All the 3 experiments proved the same result."], "question": "Now comes word from the University of California, Berkeley, a new study has confirmed that the richer you are the less compassionate you are In a study just published in the journal Emotion, psychologist Jennifer Stellar sought to determine the empathic  capacities of a group of 300 college students, who had been hand-selected for maximum economic diversity. As a rule, college students have just one income level: poor. Stellar thus chose her subjects based on the income of the people who respond to the requests and write the checks: the parents. In the first of three experiments, she had 148 of her subjects fill out reports how often they experience emotions such as joy, love, compassion and horror. She also had them agree or disagree with statements like \"I often notice people who need help.\" When the numbers on these lists were processed, Stellar found no meaningful personality differences among the students that could be attributable to income except one: across the board, the lower the subjects' family income, the higher their score on compassion. The second study involved 64 subjects who watched two videos -- an emotionally neutral instructional video on construction techniques, and a far more charged one that involved real families coping with a cancer-stricken child. Again, the subjects filled out emotional lists and again they scored similarly. But the lower-income volunteers continued to come out higher on the compassion-and-empathy scale. During this study, Stellar also used heartbeat monitors to determine their physical reactions to the two videos. There was, not surprisingly, no difference in heart rate when the instructional video was playing, but when the cancer stories began, the heartbeats of the lower-income volunteers slowed noticeably -- a counterintuitive  sign of caring. An immediate threat to ourselves or another causes heart rate to jump, the better to snap into action to respond to the danger. An emotional crisis can have the opposite physical effect on observers -- helping them settle down to provide the quieter attention that simply listening and comforting requires. In the final part of the study, 106 of the participants were paired off and told to interview each other as if they were applying for a position as lab manager. So that the subjects would have real skin in the game, the ones who performed best in the interviews -- as judged by Stellar-- would win a cash prize. All of the subjects reported feeling the same levels of stress or anxiety when they were being interviewed, but only the lower-income subjects were reliably able to detect the same feelings in their partner when the roles were reversed. So does this mean the rich really can't feel the poor? A low score on the compassion scale doesn't mean a lack of capacity for the feeling, Stellar argues.

As a rule, college students have just one income level: poor. Stellar thus chose her subjects based on the income of the people who respond to the requests and write the checks: the parents. In the first of three experiments, she had 148 of her subjects fill out reports how often they experience emotions such as joy, love, compassion and horror. She also had them agree or disagree with statements like \"I often notice people who need help.\" When the numbers on these lists were processed, Stellar found no meaningful personality differences among the students that could be attributable to income except one: across the board, the lower the subjects' family income, the higher their score on compassion. The second study involved 64 subjects who watched two videos -- an emotionally neutral instructional video on construction techniques, and a far more charged one that involved real families coping with a cancer-stricken child. Again, the subjects filled out emotional lists and again they scored similarly. But the lower-income volunteers continued to come out higher on the compassion-and-empathy scale. During this study, Stellar also used heartbeat monitors to determine their physical reactions to the two videos. There was, not surprisingly, no difference in heart rate when the instructional video was playing, but when the cancer stories began, the heartbeats of the lower-income volunteers slowed noticeably -- a counterintuitive  sign of caring. An immediate threat to ourselves or another causes heart rate to jump, the better to snap into action to respond to the danger. An emotional crisis can have the opposite physical effect on observers -- helping them settle down to provide the quieter attention that simply listening and comforting requires. In the final part of the study, 106 of the participants were paired off and told to interview each other as if they were applying for a position as lab manager.

It also sells music recorders,coffee makers,food,and even books. But most of all,it sells the idea of being a warm and friendly place for people to sit,read or talk.           Starbucks is a great success story. Buyers ate willing to pay as much as five dollars for coffee drink. Many people say they go to Starbucks because they can depend on it to have exactly what they want and it is nearby. Some say Starbucks has helped to educate people about coffee from many countries.     However, some people do not like the company's expansion. Owners of independent coffee stores cannot compete with Starbucks. Some small coffee sellers even took the company to court,saying Starbucks controls the market and foxes out competition.

{"answer": 0, "choices": ["recognition", "recall", "memorization", "relearning"], "question": "Memory is the ability to keep track of things that have happened in the past. Memory really is learning. One needs memory to ride a bicycle. A dog needs to remember if it is to come when called. Memory is said to be stored in the brain as a \"memory trace .\" What makes up this trace is not known. Some scientists believe that certain chemical substances may carry certain memories. For example, one substance, when given to rats, causes them to fear the dark. Other research into memory has to do with how the brain works. Psychologists use three means to find out how a person remembers. For example, give a person a grocery list. Let the person memorize the list, then put it away. The most natural way to find out how much a person remembers of the grocery list is to ask what he or she remembers. This is called the method of recall. Another method is called recognition. Give the person another grocery list. Ask him or her to choose items on the first list from the items that are on only the second list. Often a person will be able to recognize things that he or she cannot recall. A third method of finding how much a person remembers is called relearning. Here the person is asked to read over the first list. The person will probably learn the list the second time faster than he did the first time. The difference in the time it takes to relearn the list is thought of as a measure of how much a person has remembered. One way of remembering something is to repeat it many times.

I often lack confidence in my own abilities as a teacher, so it gave me quite a lift when a friend who works with families in the community mentioned that he has heard several times from parents how glad they are to have their kids in my class. It just feels more important somehow to have the words said by people who don't know I'll ever hear them. Sure, it's pleasant when we can say nice things about other people. Watch for your next opportunity to be the reporter! Make sure to tell them about the nice things being said behind their backs! What encouraged the author to be a good teacher?", "subject": ""}

Their history is fast becoming one of the legends of the Old West. Horace Austin Warner Tabor was a school teacher in Vermont. With his first wife and two children he left Vermont by covered wagon in 1855 to homestead in Kansas. Perhaps he did not find farming to his liking, or perhaps he was lured  by rumors of fortunes to be made in Colorado mines. At any rate, a few years later he moved west to the small Colorado mining camp known as California Gulch, which he later renamed Leadville when he became its leading citizen. \"Great deposits of lead are sure to be found here.\" he said. As it turned out, it was silver, not lead, that was to make Leadville's fortune and wealth. Tabor knew little about mining himself, so he opened a general store, which sold everything from boots to salt, flour, and tobacco.It was his custom to \"grubstake\" prospective miners, in other words, to supply them with food and supplies, or \"grub\", while they looked for ore , in return for which he would get a share in the mine if one was discovered. He did this for a number of years, but no one that he aided ever found anything of value. Finally one day in the year 1878, so the story goes, two miners came in and asked for \"grub\". Tabor had decided to quit supplying it because he had lost too much money that way. These were persistent, however, and Tabor was too busy to argue with them. \"Oh help yourself. One more time won't make any difference,\" He said and went on selling shoes and hats to other customers. The two miners took $17 worth of supplies, in return for which they gave Tabor a one-third interest in their findings. They picked a barren place on the mountain side and began to dig. After nine days they struck a rich vein of silver. Tabor bought the shares of the other two men, and so the mine belonged to him alone. This mine, known as the \"Pittsburgh Mine,\" made $1,300,000 for Tabor in return for his $17 investment. Later Tabor bought the Matchless Mine on another barren hillside just outside the town for $117,000. This turned out to be even more unbelievable than the Pittsburgh, yielding $35,000 worth of silver per day at one time. Leadville grew.

However, nearly all require some break in one's career in order to attend school full time.

Additionally, such programs require a fixed time commitment which can also impact negatively on one's career and family time. Of the many approaches to teaching and learning, however, perhaps the most flexible   is that called distance learning. Distance learning is an educational method which allows the students the flexibility to study at his or her own pace to achieve the academic goals which are so necessary in today's world.

Additionally, the student may enroll in distance learning courses from actually any place in the world, while continuing to pursue their chosen career. Individual assistance may be available via regular airmail, telephone, fax machine, teleconferencing and over the Internet. Good distance learning programs are characterized by the inclusion of a subject evaluation tool with every subject, so a student doesn't need to travel away from home to take a test.

{"answer": 2, "choices": ["Television viewers are determined by male viewers", "Rich viewers contribute most to television companies", "Sports are gaining importance in advertising on television", "Commercial advertisers are the major sponsors of sport event"], "question": "Sports account for a growing amount of income made on the sales of commercial time by television companies.  Many television companies have used sports to attract viewers from particular sections of the general public, and then they have sold audiences to advertisers. An attraction of sport programs for the major U. S.  media companies is that events are often held on Saturday and Sunday afternoons--the slowest time periods of the week for general television viewing.  Sport events are the most popular weekend programs, especially among male viewers who may not watch much television at other times during the week. This means the television networks are able to sell advertising time at relatively high prices during what normally would be dead time for programming. Media corporations also use sports to attract commercial sponsors that might take their advertising dollars elsewhere if television stations did not report certain sports.  The people in the advertising departments of major corporations realize that sports attract made viewers. They also realize that most business travelers are men and that many men make family decisions on the purchases of computers, cars and life insurance. Golf and tennis are special cases for television programming. These sports attract few viewers, and the ratings are unusually low. However, the audience for these sports is attractive to certain advertisers. It is made up of people from the highest income groups in the United States, to certain advertisers. It is made up of people from the highest income groups in the United States, including many lawyers and business managers. This is why television reporting of golf and tennis is sponsored by companies selling high-priced cars, business and personal computer, and holiday trips. This is also why the networks continue to carry these programs regardless of low ratings.  Advertisers are willing to pay high fees to reach high-income consumers and those managers who make decisions to buy thousands of \"company cars\" and computer, with such viewers, these programs don't need high ratings to stay on the air.

{"answer": 1, "choices": ["business", "life", "politics", "forum"], "question": "The quality of water supply in southern Beijing has been improving in recent years, an official said. In addition to improvements in the network of pipes, the government has been upgrading three recycled water plants in the south of the capital, said Zhao Lei, spokesman for the Beijing Municipal Commission of Development and Reform. \"The transformation of the three plants has increased the recycled water processing capacity by 160,000 cubic meters per day,\" he said. In addition, the city is also speeding up the construction of sewage treatment plants to further recycle the sewage, Zhao said. Zhang Xiang, a researcher from Nature University, an environmental protection NGO in Beijing, said recycled water use should be promoted, especially in water-scarce cities such as Beijing. Setting up more recycled water plants in the capital will not only promote efficient water use, but also reduce costs because recycling water is much cheaper than transferring it over long distances, he said. According to the Beijing Water Authority, the capital will set up 46 more recycled water plants citywide in the next three years while upgrading 20 sewage treatment plants. The treatment rate of domestic sewage in downtown Beijing will reach 98 percent by the end of 2015, it said. The capital's recycled water is mainly used for industry, landscaping and cleaning, Zhang said. Many new communities in southern Beijing are equipped with a network to recycle water. In the past, people were not enthusiastic about using recycled water. However, as the government has boosted the quality of recycled water and set up more recycled water plants, more residents are gradually accepting it. Residents in southern Beijing will also enjoy more clean energy, as the government will replace traditional coal-burning stoves with electric radiators as part of a three-year plan to develop southern Beijing from 2013 to 2015. Since 2010, Beijing has taken measures to develop its southern areas.

You won't see it again until it gets hungry--then it pauses on its sprint through the kitchen long enough to turn its nose up at whatever you're serving. when you reach out to ruffle its head, in that old affectionate gesture, it twists away from you, then gives you a blank stare, as if trying to remember where it has seen you before. You, not realizing that the dog is now a cat, think something must be desperately wrong with it.  It seems so antisocial, so distant, sort of depressed. It won't go on family outings. Since you are the one who raised it, taught it to fetch and stay and sit on command, you assume that you did something wrong.  Flooded with guilt and fear, you redouble your efforts to make your pet behave. Only now you're dealing with a cat, so everything that worked before now produces the opposite of the desired result.  Call it, and it runs away. Tell it to sit, and it jumps on the counter. The more you go toward it, wringing your hands, the more it moves away. Put a dish of food near the door, and let it come to you.  But remember that a cat needs your help and your affection too. Sit still, and it will come, seeking that warm, comforting lap it has not entirely forgotten. Be there to open the door for it. One day your grown-up child will walk into the kitchen, give you a big kiss and say, \"You've been on your feet all day.  Let me get those dishes for you. \" Then you'll realize your cat is a dog again. What is the chief purpose of writing this passage?", "subject": ""}

A hot, dry summer has caused another flood of such claims. And one of the players that benefit the most from this story is the media: the idea of \"extreme\" climate simply makes for more exciting news. Consider Paul Krugman writing breathlessly in The New York Times about the \"rising incidence of extreme events.\" He claims that global warming caused the current drought in America's Midwest, and that supposedly record-high corn prices could cause a global food crisis .  But the United Nations's latest assessment tells us precisely the opposite--there has an overall slight tendency toward less dryness in North America. Moreover, there is no way that Krugman could have identified this drought as being caused by global warming without a time machine since climate models estimate that such detection will be possible by 2048, at the earliest. And, fortunately, this year's drought appears unlikely to cause a food crisis, as global rice and wheat supplies are plentiful. Moreover, Krugman overlooks inflation :Prices have increased six-fold since 1969.So, the inflation-adjusted price of corn was higher throughout most of the 1970s. Finally, Krugman forgets that concerns about global warming are the main reason that corn prices have skyrocketed since 2005.Nowadays 40 percent of corn grown in the United States is used to produce ethanol ,which raises the price of corn -at the expense of many of the world's poorest people.

The application of biotechnology to energy production seems even more promising. In 1996 the famous science fiction writer, Arthur C.

She posted the portrait on Sina Weibo, and called for Web users to take photos with the portrait in different locations and send them to her on May 11.Over the following five days she received about 20,000 photos, most of which were sent by people she had never met. She says that her grandfather, while too weak to view all the photos, has said that he is happy. \"Thanks to all these helpers, I have become a celebrity   around the world,\" the old man joked.

These complicated equations help keep the calendar in balance with the orbit of the earth. Today, we still use the Gregorian calendar. In about 3,000 years, the calendar will be only one day out of step with the seasons, It's still not perfect, but mathematicians decided it was as close as we could get.

Scientists and doctors are already using tiny snakes that coil through the human body armed with sharp surgical tools to perform operations on hearts, prostate cancer, and other diseased organs. The snake robots that carry tiny cameras, scissors and forceps, and even more advanced sensors are being developed. The next generation of the robots will be wireless, and will explore inside your body on their own--- not attached to any cables. For now, they are powered by cables that humans control. Experts say the day is coming when some robots will roam around the body on their own. But the experts in robotics say the new creations work best when they are designed for very specific tasks. Howie Choset has been researching and building robots, particularly snake robots. He believes that his snake robot and others like it can help reduce medical costs by making complex surgery faster and easier. Choset says his new design is smaller and more flexible than earlier models. The size of surgical robots allows surgeons to operate with far less damage to the body, helping the patient heal faster. Choset has also built larger snake robots designed for search and rescue, or just exploration. They can climb poles and trees and then look around through a camera in the head and slither through places that humans cannot reach. \" We sent our snake robots into these caves in the Red Sea to look for evidence of ancient Egyptian ships,\" he said. \" To me, archeology is like search and rescue, but everyone has been dead for 5,000 years.\" The doctors are very excited about the potential for surgical robots to do things that humans can't do.

{"answer": 3, "choices": ["How to Be a Good Graffiti Artist.", "Stop Removing Graffiti!", "Do You Like Graffiti?", "Is Graffiti Art?"], "question": "Almost anywhere in the world, you can probably see graffiti  . Although it's usually more common in big cities, it can be found in almost any community, big or small. The problem with graffiti art is the question of whether it's really art. This isn't always an easy question to answer, simply because there are so many different types of graffiti. While some simply consists of collections of letters, known as tags, with little artistic value, such examples are easy to find, especially on larger spaces such as walls. If it weren't for the fact that most graffiti is placed on private property without permission, it might be more commonly recognized as a legal form of art. Most graffiti, however, annoys the property owner, who is more likely to paint over it or remove it than accept it as art. Many ways of removing graffiti have been developed, such as paints that dissolve graffiti paint, or make it easy to remove. Community groups and government departments often organize graffiti-removal teams. It hardly makes sense to encourage artists to deface   private or public property; but perhaps there are ways to work with them rather than just oppose them. Graffiti artists can, for example, create murals   for property owners, and get paid for them.

At the same time, it notes that too little food is not the only cause of poor nutrition  . Many children may suffer for other reasons. For example, the study says that mothers often fail to give their newly born babies their first breast milk. This \"milk\" is called colostrum  .

But what can blind people do if they are allergic  to dogs or just don't like them? For these people, they can turn to the Guide Horse Foundation. Janet and Don Burleson founded  the organization in 1999. They began training miniature horses to help guide blind people. Miniature horses look just like common horses, only much smaller. They are generally less than 34 inches tall. Cuddles was the foundation's first guide horse in full service. She became 45-year-old Dan Shaw's helper. Shaw has an eye disease and his sight is very poor. One night, while filling out a form to get a guide dog, Shaw heard a news story on TV about people training horses to guide the blind. Shaw loves horses and wanted a guide animal that would live a long time. So he applied ,and a year later, Cuddles and Shaw began training as a team. On a trip to New York, Cuddles helped Shaw safely visit many places of interest .They even traveled on a boat and on the subway system. Shaw says that he is very lucky to have Cuddles.

Mixing different chemical drugs in the lab to become new substances in chemistry makes students excited. While studying botany or zoology, students can visit a garden or zoo. But physics limits students to listening to the boring lectures which are hard to understand. For example,  why an apple dropping from a tree travels downwards but not upwards. But Mr. Sankaram's classroom antics to cause students to listen to topics such as how sound travels in air or why light travels faster than sound made him stand out from the rest of the teachers. At that time, most students in our school attended the college to please their parents, and some parents were proud of their children for simply attending a college, no-matter whether they benefited or not. They didn't study hard. But a few students were diligent and they wanted to study pre-medical courses to gain admission into the medical school. The schooling of pre-medical courses was very expensive. The college was next to the medical school. The wall separating them was about four feet high. Few tried to jump over the wall to get free pre-medical courses. Doing this was at risk of injuries and the climbing was forbidden. The college where Mr. Sankaram taught was known for unruly and naughty students. The unruly students usually sat at the back of the classroom.

Confused, I glanced toward my stone-faced teacher. Having no choice, I slowly raised the report I had worked on, hoping to hide myself. \"What could be causing everyone to act this way?\" Quickly, I flashed back to the day Miss Lancelot gave me the task. This was the first real task I received in my new school. It seemed simple: go on the Internet and find information about a man named George Washington. Since my idea of history came from an ancient teacher in my home country, I had never heard of that name before. As I searched for the name of this fellow, it became obvious that there were two people with the same name who looked completely different! One invented hundreds of uses for peanuts, while the other led army across America. I stared at the screen, wondering which one my teacher meant. I called my grandfather for a golden piece of advice: flip   a coin. Heads--the commander, and tails--the peanuts guy. Ah! Tails, my report would be about the great man who invented peanut butter, George Washington Carver.Weeks later, standing before this unfriendly mass, I was totally lost. Oh well, I lowered the paper and sat down at my desk, burning to find out what I had done wrong. As a classmate began his report, it all became clear, \"My report is on George Washington, the man who started the American Revolution.\" The whole world became quiet! How could I know that she meant that George Washington? Obviously, my grade was terrible. Heartbroken but fearless, I decided to turn this around. I talked to Miss Lancelot, but she insisted: No re-dos; no new grade. I felt that the punishment was not justified, and I believed I deserved a second chance. At last, I worked very hard for the rest of the school year. Ten months later, that chance came as I found myself sitting in the headmaster's office with my grandfather, now having a completely different conversation. I smiled and flashed back to the embarrassing moment at the beginning of the year as the headmaster informed me of my chance to skip the sixth grade. Justice is sweet!

One invented hundreds of uses for peanuts, while the other led army across America. I stared at the screen, wondering which one my teacher meant. I called my grandfather for a golden piece of advice: flip   a coin. Heads--the commander, and tails--the peanuts guy. Ah! Tails, my report would be about the great man who invented peanut butter, George Washington Carver.Weeks later, standing before this unfriendly mass, I was totally lost. Oh well, I lowered the paper and sat down at my desk, burning to find out what I had done wrong. As a classmate began his report, it all became clear, \"My report is on George Washington, the man who started the American Revolution.\" The whole world became quiet! How could I know that she meant that George Washington? Obviously, my grade was terrible. Heartbroken but fearless, I decided to turn this around. I talked to Miss Lancelot, but she insisted: No re-dos; no new grade. I felt that the punishment was not justified, and I believed I deserved a second chance. At last, I worked very hard for the rest of the school year. Ten months later, that chance came as I found myself sitting in the headmaster's office with my grandfather, now having a completely different conversation.

They are able to hold their breath for up to 10 minutes by slowing down their heart rate, allowing them to hunt for their prey for a longer period of time. They have been known to continuously hunt for up to 30 hours at a time, with their eyesight and hearing playing an important part in finding their food. Being so large, they do not have that many natural predators   that they need to be on the lookout for. Eleven months after getting pregnant, the female will give birth to one baby on land. If the baby can survive long enough, they can live to be 20 to 25 years old. California sea lions are not listed as an endangered species. This is largely because of laws such as the US Marine Mammal Protection Act of 1972. Hopefully such acts will continue to show results. What is the main reason why California sea lions aren't endangered?", "subject": ""}

It is a proper method of growing plants on the roof and does not refer to the mere green color of the roof. People benefit a lot from these green roofing systems, and they are gaining popularity day by day. Human beings have occupied major areas of land and transformed them into huge buildings, which has severely affected the environment and the natural habitat of bird and insects. Green roofing compensates for that. It creates a natural habitat for creatures like bees, grasshoppers and other insects. Modern roofs need a lot of energy to control the temperatures in winter and summer. However, green roofs reduce the amount of energy required for controlling temperatures, thus making them energy-efficient. As green roofing is highly energy-efficient, it can act as a encouragement for people who are interested in green roofing systems and their benefits. It will increase the market value of the building and fetch the owner a great share of profit. As the vegetation requires a water supply, there is a inbuilt water preservation layer in the green roof system. This layer helps to keep the rainwater. It makes full use of the rainwater and prevents wastage. During heavy rains, the water runs off the flat roof. The green roof prevents this overflow by slowing down the volume of running water. Green roofs can compensate for the lost greenery in urban areas and increase the artistic value of an area. Your building will look beautiful, coated with green vegetation.

One example is Windsor Castle, which is a home to the British queen. It is in the country or Berkshire, not far from London. Castles have walls around them. In the old days, soldiers would stand on the walls to guard the people in the castle. If enemies came they would shoot arrows and throw stones at them. Castles also had moats. A moat is a river around the wall that makes it difficult for enemies to get in. It could be either dry or filled with water. Other people from younger countries love European castles. In the US there are rich people who have brought broken parts of castles to their country and rebuilt them. And some people build \"replica\" castles---modern copies of Castle. You probably know the Disneyland Castle in California, US. But did you know it is based on a famous castle in Germany built by King Ludwig IIof Bavaria?

{"answer": 0, "choices": ["Children should be taught to read at an early age.", "Children can read better than most adult students.", "Children have more synapses than most adults.", "Children are supposed to learn to read on the Internet."], "question": "Teaching a child to read at a young age gives him a valuable start in life. Reading is the basic part of education and a child's reading ability will influence his school success greatly. Learning difficulties, many of which begin from poor reading skills, can damage a school child's confidence and affect his future achievement. Young children are programmed to learn and they can learn better with encouragement. Ten to twenty minutes of reading a day still leaves plenty of time for play. Many parents are concerned that learning to read is too challenging a task for a pre-school child, but they should also remember that most children learn to speak by the time they are 3. Learning a language is probably the single most challenging task any individual can undertake, yet children do it without formal instruction, achieving the fluency much better than adult language students. There is a window of opportunity in terms of IQ development, which is most open during a child's early years. A scientific study, carried out by Dr. Peter Huttenlocher at the University of Chicago, showed that the number of connectors, called synapses , between the nerve endings in a newborn baby's brain is similar to the number in the average adult brain. These synapses increase rapidly during early childhood. By 12-24 months a child's brain has about 50% more synapses than the average adult brain. After that the synapses which are not in use begin to atrophy . For most people, from age 16, the number remains steady. It begins to drop again as we move into our golden years. Doing intellectual activities at a young age, such as learning to read, can stimulate and preserve these connectors in the brain resulting in a long-term beneficial effect on IQ development. Another notable study is probably the Milwaukee project. This study took a group of babies, all of whose mothers had low IQs, and gave them special training for seven hours a day, five days a week, until they started first grade. By the age of 6 these children had an average IQ 30 points higher than their contemporaries. The overwhelming conclusion is that the early intellectual stimulation can have a positive, long-term effect on a child's brain development. From birth you should talk to and explain things to your baby. Reading to him can be a wonderful way of spending quality time with your child. The enjoyment of books and being familiar with the idea of print will pave the way for(......)learning to read later. If your child is a fast learner you can help him realize his potential by introducing him to the joy of the printed word at an early age.

An increase in sea levels of just 18 to 59 centimeters would make the Maldives -- a nation of tiny coral islands in the Indian Ocean -- virtually uninhabitable by 2100, the UN's climate change panel has warned. President Mohamed Nasheed has vowed a fight for survival, and last month he signed a deal with a Dutch company to study proposals for a floating structure that could support a convention centre, homes and an 18-hole golf course. \"It is still early stages and we are awaiting a report on the possibility,\" a government official said. The company, Dutch Docklands, is currently building floating developments in the Netherlands and Dubai. There was no immediate comment from the firm but its website said it undertook projects that make \"land from water by providing large-scale floating constructions to create similar conditions as on land\". The Maldives began work on an artificial island known as the Hulhumale near the crowded capital island of Male in 1997 and more than 30,000 people have been settled there to ease _ . The city, which has a population of 100,000, is already protected from rising sea levels by a 30-million-dollar sea wall, and the government is considering increasingly imaginative ways to combat climate change.

But scientists are still unable to make predictions exact enough for people to plan to handle the loss of land and the threat to coastal communities expected over this century. \"We know sea level is going to rise, but how much, and how fast, and where, we really still don't know,\" said Josh Willis, a climate scientist.  _ It doesn't rise all the same as more water pours in. As global warming raises sea levels, some places are expected to see higher-than-average increases, and a few places, may even see decreases. It's reported that over the course of this century, sea levels will rise between 8 inches and 6.6 feet around the planet. Scientists know this increase will be driven by the expansion of water as it warms--warmer water takes up more space--and the melting of ice. But the effects of warming water and melting ice on sea-level rise are expected to vary from area to area. And the melting of ice of the Antarctic and Greenland presents the largest uncertainty for the future, but air, land and water also play roles in changes to sea level. For example, sea level near the ice getting melt actually decreases, because the ground under the melting ice rises as the heavy ice disappears. Climate change is expected to change ocean currents and the winds that help drive ocean currents. These changes will affect the distribution of heat within the oceans, and, as a result, affect changes in sea level. Nowadays, scientists use two types of models to make predictions about the future of sea levels, but the two don't agree. If scientists can't accurately predict sea-level increase for the coming years, the least we can do is measure what happening today with the help of the satellite, Jason-2, but it's reaching the end of its operational life. What problems will scientists meet with in predicting future climate changes?", "subject": ""}

Scientists, psychologists and English academics at Liverpool University have found that reading the works of the Bard and other classical writers has a beneficial effect on the mind, catches the reader's attention and triggers moments of self-reflection. Using scanners  , they monitored the brain activity of volunteers as they read works by William Shakespeare, William Wordsworth, T.S Eliot and others. They then \"translated\" the original texts into more \"straightforward\", modern language and again monitored the readers' brains as they read the words. Scans showed that the more \"challenging\" essays and poetry set off far more electrical activity in the brain than the much plainer versions.

It is the best smartphone ever, and most users have told that they love it. So we were surprised when reading reports of reception   problems, and we immediately began researching them. To start with, holding tightly almost any mobile phone in certain ways will reduce its reception by 1 or more bars of signal strength. This is true of iPhone 4, iPhone 3GS, as well as many other phones. But some users have reported that iPhone 4 can drop 4 or 5 bars when tightly held in a way. This is a far bigger drop than normal, and as a result some have said the iPhone 4 has a faulty antenna  design. Upon research, we find that the formula  we use to calculate how many bars of signal strength to display is totally wrong. Our formula usually mistakenly displays 2 more bars than it should for a given signal strength. The big drop in bars is because the high bars were never real in the beginning. We will give a free software update to correct the formula. This software update  will also be available for iPhone 3GS. If you are not fully satisfied, you can return your undamaged iPhone to any Apple Retail Store or the online Apple Store within 30 days of buying and get all your money back.

Study results published in January, 2009 discuss how third-hand smoke is especially dangerous for children. Have you ever walked into a room that had the smell of cigarette smoke, regardless of the fact that a fan was moving the air and no one was smoking at the time? This is what researchers are calling third-hand smoke -- and it represents the poisonous deposits   that are left behind long after a cigarette is put out. Cigarette smoke contains gases and small particles that are deposited on every surface it comes in contact with, for example, the smoker's hair and clothing, or the environment the cigarette was smoked in. It's dangerous for young children who may crawl on polluted surfaces. Third-hand smoke is a serious health risk for our kids, especially those who live in the homes of smokers. Jonathan Winickoff, lead author of the study, explains, \"When you come into contact with your baby, even if you're not smoking at the time, he or she comes in contact with those poisons. And if you breast-feed, the poisons will transfer to your baby in your breast milk.\" Winickoff adds however, that nursing a baby if you're a smoker is still a better choice than bottle-feeding. Researchers involved in the study also surveyed more than 1,500 families in an effort to learn about adult attitudes regarding the danger third-hand smoke represents to their children and how that might affect smoking in the home. Approximately 95 percent of nonsmokers and 84 percent of smokers believe that secondhand smoke is dangerous for children. On the issue of whether third-hand smoke threatens the health of children, 65 percent of nonsmokers and 43 percent of smokers felt that third-hand smoke harms kids. When asked about rules regarding smoking in the home, approximately 88 percent of nonsmokers said they don't allow smoking, while only 27 percent of smokers forbid smoking in the home.
