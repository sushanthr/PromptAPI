In 2000, the Finns surprised the world when their 15-year-olds scored at the top of a closely watched international exam called the PISA.

Pasi Sahlberg, an official with Finland's Ministry of Education and Culture, is in Seattle this week to share the story of Finland's success, and what states like Washington can learn from it. Sahlberg's message, although he is too polite to put it so bluntly : Stop testing so much, trust teachers more; give less homework; shorten the school day. On Tuesday, in a room filled with teachers, principals, professors, school-board members and policy makers, Sahlberg joked about the Finns' reputation  for being a quiet, humble people. \"When Finland hit the top of the PISA,\" he said, \"the biggest disbelievers were Finns.\" More seriously, Finland never set out to create the world's top school system. Instead, he said, the country decided in the 1970s that it wanted to ensure that a student's success didn't depend on family background. \"Finland relied on cooperation among teachers and schools, rather than on competition.

English language holidays are taken in English-speaking countries like England, the USA or Australia. While there, you study in a language school with students from many different countries. You live with local people, often staying with a host family. A language holiday can be of any length - from one week to one year - but most are two or three weeks. What are the Benefits of a Language Holiday? Language holidays have become a very popular method of learning English because they have many advantages: Total Exposure  Because you are in an English-speaking country, you are constantly exposed to English from the time you wake up and have breakfast with your host family until late evening and your last drink in a local pub. You have little or no opportunity to escape the English language. This is how you learn your own language - constant exposure. Mixed Classes   When you study in your own country, all the other students in your class speak your language, so you are not forced to use English. On a language holiday, students come from countries all over the world. It is possible that nobody in your class will speak your language, so you will just have to speak English! Freedom From Pressure   On a language holiday you are away from home and can forget the everyday pressures of school or business. Your mind is more relaxed and you can learn more easily. Cultural Understanding   Learning a language is not only about learning words. Different nations have different cultures. People think and behave differently. Their language is closely associated with their culture. By visiting and living in a foreign country, you learn to understand the culture and the people - and so better understand the language.

A new study says the warm feeling in a hug is more than just skin deep . Researchers from the University of California , Berkeley believe that this loving feeling could have anti-aging benefits . Oxytocin , sometimes referred to as the \" love hormone \" or the \" trust hormone , \" is responsible for those indescribable feelings we get when we're bonding with a lover or a loved one . Levels of the hormone drop as we age , and evidence suggests that could be a contributing factor to the _ of our bodies as we age . Muscle loss in particular is one of the major side effects of aging , with our bodies losing up to 5 percent of our muscle mass each decade past our 30s . In the study , published in the journal Nature Communications , researchers injected oxytocin into older mice with muscle damage . The older mice had lower levels of the homeone than younger mice initially . But after nine days , the older mice who were given the hormone healed better than those who did not . In fact , their ability to repair muscle damage was up to 80 percent that of the younger mice . The results were not only fast-acting , but provide hope for future uses of the hormone in a variety of anti-aging capacities . \" This is good because it demonstrates that extra oxytocin improves aged tissue stem cells without making muscle stem cells divide uncontrollably , \" study co-author Wendy Cousins said in a statement . Previous uses of anti-aging molecules have also been associated with higher cancer risk , but researchers are hopeful that oxytocin can be useful in humans without this risk . In the future , researchers of Berkeley say oxytocin could be used to fight other age-related health issues by improving bone health and even being used as an alternative to hormone replacement therapy . Now go out and give someone a hug . What can be a suitable title for the passage ?", "subject": ""}

I'm Jan from Mrs. Lake's class. My class wants to work together to help the public. We think we have found a great way to do this. Last month we did a class project on the highways near our town. We learned about the Adopt-a-Highway Program. This program brings people together to pick up litter along the roads. We think it would be a great idea for all students in our school to join the program and adopt a highway. Adopting a highway is not like adopting a pet. When a highway is adopted, only part of the highway is cared for by a group of people. The group agrees to work every week to keep its part of the highway clean. Each group gets its own sign that has the name of the group printed on it. The sign is put up at the side of the road. This sign lets drivers know who is keeping that area of the road clean. The Adopt-a-Highway Program is a great way for people to help their environment look nicer. Also, the government does not have to send out as many road workers. This saves money. Finally, people may try harder to keep roads clean if they see people, especially teenagers like us, cleaning them up. We will need helpers to care for our adopted highway. If you want to feel great and keep our roads clean,please come with your parents to the meeting next week. We will meet in Mrs. Lake' room on Wednesday at 6:00 P.M. At the meeting, we will talk about which roads are the dirtiest as a result of people's unkind acts. Then we' ll try to pick an area to adopt and clean. I look forward to seeing you at the meeting.

{"answer": 3, "choices": ["They work in that hospital mainly   because they love toys.", "Most of them focus on repairing   modern dolls for little kids.", "They are not capable of repairing   toys that are extremely rare.", "There are different experts who   specialize in different types of toys."], "question": "In this day and age when we have a tendency to toss toys that are even slightly worn, it is tough to believe that there is a \"hospital\" where dolls can be repaired and brought back to their original glory. What is even more amazing is that such a place has existed for a century and is still going strong. Welcome to Sydney's \"original Doll Hospital\" that celebrated its l00th birthday, on February 22nd, 2013. In 1913, a general store owner in Sydney began importing dolls. However, the rubber bands  that held them together would often break. Luckily for him, his brother Harold Chapman Sr., was a good handyman and set aside a little \"hospital\" area in the store to repair the delicate toys. But when customers found out about this, they began bringing in their raggedy dolls, stuffed animals and even leather goods and umbrellas--starting what would become a family business for many generations. In l930, Chapman's son also, named Harold, relocated the doll hospital and expanded the business even further, by agreeing to repair anything that could be fixed, no matter how big or small. While business was _ , the real boom came in 1938 during World War Two. Faced with extreme restrictions, new dolls and toys became a rarity, and young girls and boys had no option, but to get their existing ones lovingly restored. While it does not have as many employees today, the hospital that is run by his son Geoff  Chapman now sits in a spiffy location with a beautiful store-front that features everything a little girl could possibly wish for, from new to lovingly restored, to even extremely rare and valuable  dolls. Also in keeping with modern times and dolls, the doctors are now specialists--some focus on bringing back to life modern dolls, while others stick to antiques. And then there are also the soft toy experts and accessory repair experts. Though it may not appear to be, the doctors say their jobs are very interesting given that no two dolls are the same or need the same repairs and that just like medical doctors they have no idea what obstacle they will have to face when they come to work each day. The one advantage? There are no emergency night calls to worry about! What can we learn about people working in the toy repairing hospital?", "subject": ""}

Ever since he'd entered first grade, he had hated school. What's going on? If he hates school this much now, how bad will it be later on? Every kid sometimes complains about school. But five to ten percent of kids dislike it so much they don't want to attend. \"If a child seems worried or anxious about school, pretends illness to stay home, or refuses to talk about things of the school day, you should be concerned,\" says a school psychologist, Michael Martin. Fortunately, you can usually solve the problem--sometimes very easily. In our case, my husband and I visited Dustin's class and noticed that the teacher, just out of college, called only on kids who sat right under her nose. Dustin, who often sat near the back, was ignored . We simply told him to move up front. He did, and he was happy again. From the case in the passage we can conclude that   _  .", "subject": ""}

The Chinese consumers who had bought notebook computers of certain models, which have been put on Chinese market since 2007, suffered a massive flash screen failures and overheating problems. Through investigation, Chinese AQSIQ   identified these HP computers had quality problems and HP admitted this. HP made a proposal that they would extend the warranty   period of such computers, but this could not satisfied the consumers. What they needed was a thorough description of the truth. HP has \"sincerely\" apologized. But the consumers remain angry, and say that only a product recall -- as HP has done in the past -- will prove that the apology is sincere. Another apology that fell flat on its face was that of Thierry Henry, the famous French footballer.

So, what is genetic modification? Are GM foods safe? These questions have been put back into the spotlight recently. On Nov 19, the Food and Drug Administrati0n (FDA) in the US announced that it had approved the AquAdvantage salmon to go on the market, making it the first genetically modified animal to be approved as food anywhere in the world. GM foods are plants or animals that have been given a gene from another plant or animal to make them stronger in some way. The AquAdvantage salmon contains a gene from another type of salmon that makes it grow faster. Although the FDA has said \"food from the fish is safe to eat\", some believe that scientists can't completely understand the potential health risks of GM foods, simply because they're so new. Others worry that the fish could escape into the wild and cause ecological problems. GM crops have experienced the same controversy, even though GM technology cuts down on the use of pesticides on crops and increases yields. While GM animals are new, GM crops have already appeared on our plates: A total of 28 countries in the world including the US, Brazil and India planted 181.5 million hectares (1.815 million km2) of GM crops in 2014, according to the International Service for tile Acquisition of Agri-biotech Applications. In China, we grow GM cotton and papaya and import GM soybeans, corn, rape, cotton and beets from abroad. Due to safety worries, many countries have regulations for producing and selling GM food. In European Union countries, each GM food must be approved before it can be used. This process can take up to 17 months. The origin of all GM foods must also be traceable, and all food with a GM content of more than 0.9 percent must also be labeled, according to EU website europa.eu. The US is less strict about GM foods. According to FDA regulations, companies introducing new GM foods to the market should report them at least 120 days before release. The labeling is voluntary, except that a product cannot be labeled as \"GM-free\" if genetically modified materials are used. In China, GM foods can only be produced after strict tests by the Ministry of Agriculture say that they are safe.

However, what happened on Feb 15 , 2013 was a reminder that we're just as _ as the dinosaurs once were. Two objects from space - a meteor   and an asteroid called 2012 DA14 -  visited Earth's atmosphere on the same day. The former fell in Russia, injuring 1,200 people, while the latter passed by Earth at a record-setting close distance. Scientists had been expecting the asteroid since last year, but the meteor was a surprise. NASA's telescope system only detects asteroids at least 50 meters in diameter  , which is just about the size of 2012 DA14. But the meteor was much smaller, which made it harder to spot. But what if we do spot an asteroid that is headed right for Earth? There are several possible ways in which dangerous asteroids could be made to change its orbit. Which method is best depends on several factors and most importantly  -  how much time we have to stop it. If there is enough time before the hit, we can send off a heavy spacecraft to travel alongside the asteroid. The gravity from the spacecraft would gradually change the rock's orbit. Besides that, scientists could one day use sun-powered lasers to either make asteroids disappear or change their course.

{"answer": 2, "choices": ["Their cooperation.", "Their conflict.", "The context.", "Their instinct."], "question": "It takes two to duet  , and one question for scientists is how these coordinated   performances arise -- in birds. Are they the result of cooperation, a way in which one pair signals to others that they've got it together? Or are they the result of conflict, evolving to avoid one partner's song interfering with the other's? A study of duetting in Peruvian warbling antbirds  suggests that it might be a little of both, and that context is everything. Joseph A. Tobias and Nathalie Seddon of the University of Oxford show in Current Biology that sexual conflict can cause the female of a pair that normally cooperates to \"jam\" the male's song by singing over it. The researchers exposed antbird pairs to recorded songs of other antbirds and monitored the songs the pairs produced. In one experiment, they played the songs of an intruding pair. In this case, the resident pair \"both are likely to lose their territory, so both should cooperate,\" Dr. Tobias said. And they do. They produce a coordinated duet that in effect tells the intruders to keep away. But when the researchers played the song of a single female, the pair behaved differently. \"You'd expect the resident female to be highly motivated to defend her position in the partnership,\" Dr. Tobias said. And that's what occurs. The male sings its heart out, flirting  with the single female, and the female of the pair does its best to interfere with the song by singing over it, apparently to make her mate less attractive to the other female. \"It's clear that the male doesn't like what she's doing,\" Dr. Tobias said. The behavior \"breaks up what is otherwise a very cooperative situation into a more complicated signal,\" he added. It's the first evidence of this kind of signal jamming among pairs, Dr. Tobias said.

{"answer": 3, "choices": ["The special phenomenon about birds pairs.", "The conflict of bird pairs.", "The cooperation of bird pairs.", "The piece of music for bird pairs."], "question": "It takes two to duet  , and one question for scientists is how these coordinated   performances arise -- in birds. Are they the result of cooperation, a way in which one pair signals to others that they've got it together? Or are they the result of conflict, evolving to avoid one partner's song interfering with the other's? A study of duetting in Peruvian warbling antbirds  suggests that it might be a little of both, and that context is everything. Joseph A. Tobias and Nathalie Seddon of the University of Oxford show in Current Biology that sexual conflict can cause the female of a pair that normally cooperates to \"jam\" the male's song by singing over it. The researchers exposed antbird pairs to recorded songs of other antbirds and monitored the songs the pairs produced. In one experiment, they played the songs of an intruding pair. In this case, the resident pair \"both are likely to lose their territory, so both should cooperate,\" Dr. Tobias said. And they do. They produce a coordinated duet that in effect tells the intruders to keep away. But when the researchers played the song of a single female, the pair behaved differently. \"You'd expect the resident female to be highly motivated to defend her position in the partnership,\" Dr. Tobias said. And that's what occurs. The male sings its heart out, flirting  with the single female, and the female of the pair does its best to interfere with the song by singing over it, apparently to make her mate less attractive to the other female. \"It's clear that the male doesn't like what she's doing,\" Dr. Tobias said. The behavior \"breaks up what is otherwise a very cooperative situation into a more complicated signal,\" he added. It's the first evidence of this kind of signal jamming among pairs, Dr. Tobias said. And in that it leads the male to alter its song to avoid the female's interfering notes, it shows that this kind of conflict could, over a long period, drive the evolution of coordinated song.

{"answer": 1, "choices": ["By analyzing the data of fitness tests.", "By giving some basic information.", "By completing some questionnaires.", "By offering a certain amount of Money."], "question": "FRIDAY, Aug. 3 (Health Day News) -- Middle school students who are physically fit are likely to score higher on standardized tests measuring reading and math abilities, a new study has found. And, the average scores went up in connection with levels of fitness, the findings showed. \"The more physically fit kids were, the higher their scores,\" said the study's lead author, Trent Petrie, director of the Center for Sport Psychology at the University of North Texas in Denton. \"Parents should encourage their kids to be physically active. There are some real cognitive   and academic benefits that come from physical fitness\", Petrie said. Results of the study are scheduled to be presented Friday at the annual meeting of the American Psychological Association in Orlando, Fla. The study included more than 1,200 middle school students from five schools in a suburban area of Texas, with 561 boys and 650 girls. About 57 percent of the children were white, and nearly one-quarter were Mexican American. Nine percent were black and about 2 percent were of Asian descent. The school district provided the researchers with information on the children's race, age, grade level and whether they qualified for the free school lunch program, which was an indicator of the family's socioeconomic status. The schools also provided scores to the tests, which were given between one and four months after the researchers had assessed the children's levels of fitness. Fitness tests were administered during physical education classes to determine the youngsters' heart and lung health (cardiorespiratory fitness), as well as their body mass index (BMI), an indicator of how much body fat a person has. The children also filled out questionnaires that helped the researchers determine factors such as self-esteem and social support. After accounting for factors such as age, sex, family income and self-esteem, the researchers found that for both boys and girls, higher levels of heart and lung health predicted better scores on both the math and reading tests. For boys, perceived   social support also seemed to increase their reading scores, the investigators found. In girls, while being physically fit predicted higher reading scores, so too did a higher BMI-- which indicates more body fat. \"We were a little surprised by this finding,\" Petrie said. \"It was not as strong an association as the one with physical fitness,\" he added. The authors suspect it may have something to do with girls this age entering adolescence, which may be related to a higher BMI and slightly higher brain development. He said he plans to make great effort to look for this relationship again in larger studies to see if it was a chance finding, or if the association holds up. \"While we can't say 100 percent that physical fitness causes better academic performance, we can say that there is a strong and predictive relationship between physical fitness and academic performance,\" Petrie said. \"It's hard to tease apart   the exact reason for this association,\" said Becky Hashim, an attending clinical psychologist and assistant professor in the departments of psychiatry and pediatrics at the Children's Hospital of Montefiore, in New York City. \"It may be that the children are getting more oxygen. When the heart and lungs are working at a higher capacity, it may allow the brain to work at peak performance. Children who are less fit may be sleepier during school,\" she noted. \"I personally feel that there's probably a strong relationship between the confidence you get from being able to do something physical well and academic performance.\" Whatever the reason behind this association may be, \"there's certainly no harm in pushing physical fitness,\" Hashim added. \"Physical fitness may make you feel better, give you more confidence and improve your performance across the board,\" she said. Petrie agreed. \"Physically fit kids are happier, have higher self-esteem and, tend to have better relationships, and now we're beginning to see that there also seem to be benefits cognitively and academically.

Short-term goals are those that usually deal with present activities. Such goals can be achieved in a week or two, or possible months. It should be remembered that just as a building is no stronger than its foundation  , our long-term goals cannot be achieved without the achievement of solid short-term goals. Upon completing our short-term goals, we should date the time and then add new short-term goals that will build on those that have been completed.

In reality, though, we know that this is not true. But we still wonder where that strange feeling comes from. In fact, this is one of the ways that we're tricked by time, according to the website All That Is Interesting. The website lists several wrong impressions we often have about time. Let's have a look. First of all, emotions affect our time-keeping abilities: Negative emotions, especially anxiety and boredom, make time seem longer because they make us concentrate more on the passage of time. However, when we are enjoying ourselves, we pay more attention to what we are doing and are likely to lose track of(...) time. Here is another example. In 2007, a group of scientists carried out a test. In the test, people fell 50 meters into a safety net and were then asked about their experience. Although the experience took shorter than 3 seconds, the people thought it was much longer than it actually was. This is because of the way our bodies reply to danger, according to the scientists. Our bodies produce a chemical called adrenaline  when we are faced with danger. It allows us to concentrate better so that we can stay alive. As a result, we are able to remember far more details over a short period of time, which makes it seem like time is going more slowly. Another occasion when we make mistakes about time is when we take afternoon naps . Have you ever had trouble telling what time it is after a long nap? That's because the best amount of time for a nap is 20 minutes. After 20 minutes, you enter a new stage of sleep called slow-wave sleep.

I always encourage such people, but I also explain that there is a big difference between being a writer and writing. In most cases these people are dreaming of wealth and being famous, not the long hours alone at the typewriter. When I became a writer, I had no future. What I had was a friend called George. He found me a home. It was cold and had no bathroom. I could only afford a used typewriter. A year later, however, I still hadn't received a break and began to doubt myself. But I knew I wanted to write. I would keep putting my dream to the test--even though it meant living with fear of failure. This is the shadow land   of hope, and anyone with a dream must learn to live there. Then one day I got a call from a friend who asked me to be an assistant for $6,000 a year. As the dollars were dancing in my head, _ brought me to my sense. \"Thanks, but no,\" I heard myself saying. After that, I walked around my little room and started to feel like a fool. I felt a little low. Later, I gradually began to sell my articles. It was after 17 years of being a writer that Roots was published. At once I had the kind of fame and success that few writers ever experienced. The shadows had turned into great sunlight. Before that, it was a long and slow climb out of the shadows.

Pluto's recent departure from the classical planet family clearly proves that size really matters. Astronomers voted on August 24 to create the first scientific definition of the word planet, and Pluto obviously didn't make the cut. It turned out to be only a \"dwarf planet\"  . After weeks of heated debate, over 2,500 astronomers from 73 countries voted on the definition of a \"planet\" at a conference of the international Astronomical Union (IAU). According to the definition, a planet must have a clear neighborhood around its orbit. Pluto has widely been considered a planet since its discovery in 1930. Unfortunately, it has a special orbit which overlaps with Neptune's. It is all because, compared with Neptune, Pluto is very small. It is attracted by Neptune's gravity when the two planets get closer. According to IAU, a \"dwarf planet\" should have an orbit around the Sun. It will not have a clear neighborhood around its orbit, and must not be a satellite. The new classification means that the science textbooks will have to be updated.

For example, in American culture  the smile is in general an expression of pleasure. Yet it also has other uses. A woman's smile at a police officer does not carry the same meaning as the smile she gives to a young child. A smile may show love or politeness. It can also hide true feelings. It often causes confusion across cultures. For example, many people in Russia smiling at strangers in public to be unusual and even improper. Yet many Americans smile freely at strangers in public places (although this is less common in big cities). Some Russians believe that Americans smile in the wrong places; some Americans believe that Russians don't smile enough. In Southeast Asian culture, a smile is frequently used to cover painful feelings. Vietnamese people may tell a sad story but end the story with a smile.

New world records were set almost every year following Bannister's sub-4-minute-mile. Nowadays, even a high school student can reasonably run a 4-minute mile.

Forget your studies for a while. It's time to enjoy yourselves! There are many ways to celebrate this special month of graduation. You can have photos taken with your classmates and teachers, or dine out together and exchange gifts. High school students in western countries such as the United States and Canada usually have party to _ their graduation. It's to mark the time when kids turn into young men and women. After the party, teenagers either go to college or find a job. It means they will no longer depend on their parents as before. As the party, boys usually dress in dinner jackets and bow ties, though many different types of formal clothes are worn. Girls traditionally wear formal dresses, or dress to shock or be noticed, in shiny or brightly colored materials. Common party activities include dining, dancing, the crowing of a ball king and queen, and just talking to friends.

Jane's pupil, Adele Varens, is the eight-year-old French child under the legal protection of Mr. Edward Rochester, the owner of the house. (We learn later that her mother had claimed she was his illegitimate daughter. Mr. Rochester is not convinced by this claim, but felt he could not leave the little girl poor when her mother died.) Adele is a pleasant little girl, even if she is not a particularly eager student. Life goes on very peacefully for three months, until the return of Mr. Rochester. Jane first meets him on his horse, and her description of him is quite fanciful. He takes a fall and Jane helps him, although she does not know who he is until they are both back at Thornfield. It is obvious to the reader, although not to Jane, that the reason why Mr. Rochester stays at Thornfield much longer than usual is that he finds her company enjoyable. Jane, unknowingly at first, falls in love with him. Their closeness is very apparent. There is something about Thornfield that is mysterious. Jane is encouraged to focus her attention on the servant Grace Poole, who is Mr. Rochester's mad wife Bertha Mason's keeper at Thornfield, and whose drunken carelessness frequently allows Bertha to escape and do something violent. It is clear to the reader, though, that Mr. Rochester's emotional engagement is immense. When his bed is set on fire, Jane rescues him, but does not understand why the matter is not pursued, despite Mr. Rochester assuring her the criminal is Grace. The next morning Grace behaves as though she has done nothing wrong. Eventually, Mr. Rochester leaves, to go to a house party. He brings everyone at the party back with him, transforming the atmosphere in the house, and delighting Adele. One of the guests is Blanche Ingram, whom Mr. Rochester is confidently expected to marry. However, it is clear from the way she is portrayed in the book that she is too proud; our sympathies are not with her. Mr. Rochester is called away from the house, and when he returns he chooses to play the role of a fortune teller. It is clear to the reader that one of his motives is to try to turn Blanche against the idea of marriage to him. While he has clearly bothered her, he is unsuccessful. One afternoon, Jane hears that her cousin John Reed is dead and Mrs. Reed, who is probably on her deathbed, has been asking for her. With strict instructions from Mr. Rochester to return quickly, she sets off to Gateshead. On arrival, she realizes she no longer hates her cousins. However, Mrs. Reed is still bitter towards her, owing to the fact that Jane's mother was Mr Reed's favourite sister and this resulted in him apparently favouring Jane over his own children. A short time later, Mrs. Reed gives Jane a letter from her uncle, John Eyre, that was written three years earlier. It explains how he planned to adopt Jane and allow her to inherit his fortune.

Jane is encouraged to focus her attention on the servant Grace Poole, who is Mr. Rochester's mad wife Bertha Mason's keeper at Thornfield, and whose drunken carelessness frequently allows Bertha to escape and do something violent. It is clear to the reader, though, that Mr. Rochester's emotional engagement is immense. When his bed is set on fire, Jane rescues him, but does not understand why the matter is not pursued, despite Mr. Rochester assuring her the criminal is Grace. The next morning Grace behaves as though she has done nothing wrong. Eventually, Mr. Rochester leaves, to go to a house party. He brings everyone at the party back with him, transforming the atmosphere in the house, and delighting Adele. One of the guests is Blanche Ingram, whom Mr. Rochester is confidently expected to marry. However, it is clear from the way she is portrayed in the book that she is too proud; our sympathies are not with her. Mr. Rochester is called away from the house, and when he returns he chooses to play the role of a fortune teller. It is clear to the reader that one of his motives is to try to turn Blanche against the idea of marriage to him. While he has clearly bothered her, he is unsuccessful. One afternoon, Jane hears that her cousin John Reed is dead and Mrs. Reed, who is probably on her deathbed, has been asking for her. With strict instructions from Mr. Rochester to return quickly, she sets off to Gateshead. On arrival, she realizes she no longer hates her cousins. However, Mrs. Reed is still bitter towards her, owing to the fact that Jane's mother was Mr Reed's favourite sister and this resulted in him apparently favouring Jane over his own children. A short time later, Mrs. Reed gives Jane a letter from her uncle, John Eyre, that was written three years earlier. It explains how he planned to adopt Jane and allow her to inherit his fortune. Mrs. Reed never handed the letter over because of her bitterness. Jane tries once more to seek reconciliation  , but without success; her aunt dies that night. Why is Mrs. Reed bitter towards Jane?", "subject": ""}

The researchers say the material can cool buildings even on hot days. The cooling material is a very thin sheet with many layers that could be placed on a roof like solar panels . However, instead of turning sunlight into energy as solar panels do, the material turns heat into radiation. Shanhui Fan is an electrical engineering professor at Stanford University. He says that the panels have a layer of material that is like sand. The panels act like a mirror. They take heat out of buildings and reflect the light from the sun. And he says both the heat and sunlight are sent 100 kilometers into outer space. \"It's a structure  that cools itself without electricity input, even under the sun. So, what it does is basically radiate heat to outer space and also reflect the sunlight so it doesn't get heated up by the sun. Mr. Fan says it is like having a window into space. The heat is sent directly into space without warming the air.\" He says buildings in developing countries that do not have electricity or air conditioning could use the panels. \"In areas where electricity is out of reach for many people, there is a potential   benefit for storing medicine or even food. In many of these situations, being able to reduce the temperature is important. And this would provide a way to do it.\" The researchers say the main problem is creating actual cooling systems using the high-tech panels. They say it may be possible to develop a cooling spray  that could be used on present solid structures. They believe the cooling spray technology could be developed in the next three to five years.

The small island of Puerto Rico is in the West Indies, off the coast of Florida. This is where all the hurricanes begin that strike the east coast of the United States.

{"answer": 1, "choices": ["Shops with 100 employees or less.", "Shops with self-service machines.", "Shops selling goods in airports.", "Shops selling items on ships."], "question": "From Monday 5 October shoppers in England will face a charge of at least 5 pounds for some of the carrier bags they use to take home their purchases. The move follows the introduction of similar charges in Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland. The charge applies to\"single-use\"bags -- the thin plastic ones you typically get in the supermarket. The legislation says that for the charge to apply the bag must be unused, plastic, have handles and be 70 microns   thick or less. Bags for life are thicker and larger, so retailers do not have to charge for them. However, whether you get charged also depends on what gets put in the bag. Shops don't have to charge for bags used for unwrapped food, raw meat and fish, prescription medicines, uncovered knives, seeds, bulbs and flowers, or live fish. However, if other items are put in the same bag, the charge kicks in. The government is hoping to persuade shoppers to reuse bags rather than take new single-use plastic bags home from each shopping trip. In 2014, more than 7.6 billion bags were given out by the major supermarkets in England -- the equivalent of around 140 bags per person. The bags take a long time to degrade  , cause litter and are dangerous to wildlife. By introducing a charge, the government hopes to reduce the number of these bags used in supermarkets by up to 80%. Will all shops charge? They do not have to. The legislation applies to all types of shop -- from clothes shops to grocers, but only to retailers with 250 or more employees. However, some smaller shops have indicated that they will introduce a charge at the same time. Shops in airports and retailers selling on trains, aeroplanes or ships also do not have to charge. Retailers have been told to charge at least 5 pounds for single-use bags. It looks like the major grocers will go for 5 pounds on the nose. The charge of self-service machines will still apply. You will be asked how many bags you have used, and charged accordingly. What will happen to the money? Retailers are expected to give the money to good causes, but it is up to them to decide. They must report what they do to the government, which will publish the details each year. Supermarkets report a fall of up to 90% in bag use since similar charges were introduced in other parts of the UK. Marks&Spencer said it had seen a 50% reduction in bags used for clothing and homeware   since the charge came into effect in Wales and Scotland. England's scheme has more exemptions   than others -- in Wales, Scotland and Northern Ireland all stores are covered, not just large retailers, so the headline figures for the reduction in use could be lower.

While her success in college and law school led to a good job, she said, she ended up focusing on public service. \"My message to you today is that don't waste a minute living someone else's dream,\" she said. \"It takes a lot of real work to discover what brings you joy and you won't find what you love simply by checking mailboxes or surfing the net.\" She said MLK reminded her of her own high school experience in Chicago. \"My No.1 goal was to go to a high school that would push me and challenge me,\" she said. \"I wanted to go somewhere that would celebrate achievement. Unfortunately, schools like this don't exist for every kid.\" she said. \"You are blessed.\" The first lady told graduates that failure may be a part of their college lives and careers, and that how they respond determines what they will become. \"That's when you find out what you're really made of in those hard times,\" she said. \"But you can only do that if you're willing to put yourself in a position where you might fail.\" Overcoming difficulties has been the mark of many great people, she said, \"Oprah was demoted from her first job as a news reporter, and now she doesn't even need a last name,\" she said of media giant Oprah Winfrey \"And then there's this guy Barack Obama, I could take up a whole afternoon talking about his failures.

{"answer": 1, "choices": ["By taking an indirect way.", "By gaining aid from a friend.", "By taking forbidden drugs.", "By selling fake products."], "question": "Everybody cheats. Whether it's the taxi driver who tricks a visitor and takes them the long way round, or the shop assistant who doesn't give the correct change, or the police officer who accepts a bribe   - everybody's at it. Cheats in the nest include the scientist whose research was based on fake data, the game show competitors who worked with a friend in the audience or win a million pounds, and the doctor who made up his qualifications and wasn't really a doctor at all. Everybody cheats; nobody's playing the game. Is cheating acceptable, a natural way of surviving and being successful? Or is it something that should _ , and young people discouraged from doing? If it's the latter how can we explain to children why so many bend the rules? Take sport for example. The Word Cup was filled with cheating. Whether diving, pretending to be hurt or denying a handball, footballers will do anything for a free - kick or a penalty shot. France striker Henry denied cheating to win the free - kick which led to his side's second goal in their 3 - 1 victory over Spain. Many footballers, however, are often putting it on. Whatever the nationality there's one common ploy: the player rolls over holding their leg, ankle or head seeming to be in great pain. As a result a yellow card and / or free - kick is given for the foul and then, a few seconds later, the player is up and about as if nothing had happened ! The ref   may be taken in by it but youngsters watching the game aren't. they also see their heroes getting away with it. Of course it's not just football. In 1998 the Tour de France, the world's greatest cycling event, was hit by a drug - taking scandal  . The 40 bottles of forbidden drugs found with the Fustian team caused a massive investigation that almost caused the Tour to be abandoned. One rider, Veronique, was banned for 9 months. He claimed: \"You have cheats in sport, just as you do in business - there will always be people trying to take a short cut. At least we're not turning a blind eye to the problem, which other sports are.\" Is it all unavoidable? There's huge pressure on all athletes to perform for their fans and for their sponsors. It's success, money and power that rule professional sport rather than an honest at tempt to do the best one can. Meanwhile companies around the world are losing billions of dollars to fake products. From cut price CDs and DVDs to sportswear, cheap fake products are everywhere. It has become socially acceptable to buy fake Gucci bags and illegal copies of films. If parents are doing this, their children will follow. So perhaps it's not surprising that around the world more pupils than ever are caught cheating during exams. In one case missing exam papers were put up for sale on the Internet. In another, widespread cheating took place by pupils using their mobile phones to receive tested answers.

A week later, she had an operation and since then Anna and Elena had been taking turns helping her deal with her grief. Politkovskaya was supposed to spend the day at the hospital, but her twenty-six-year-old daughter, who was pregnant, had just moved into Politkovskaya's apartment, on Lesnaya Street, while her own place was being prepared for the baby. \"Anna had so much on her mind,\" Elena Kudimova told me when we met in London, before Christmas. \"And she was trying to finish her article.\" Politkovskaya was a special reporter for the small newspaperNovaya Gazeta, and, like most of her work, the piece focused on the terror that can be seen all over the southern republic of Chechnya. This time, she had been trying to report repeated cruel acts done by people faithful to the Prime Minister, Ramzan Kadyrov, who are in favour of Russia. In the past seven years, Politkovskaya had written dozens of accounts of life during wartime; many had been collected in her book \"A Small Corner of Hell: reports from Chechnya.\" Politkovskaya was far more likely to spend time in a hospital than on a battlefield, and her writing bore frequent witness to robbery, and the uncontrolled cruelty of life in a place that few other Russians--and almost no other reporters--cared to think about.

The financial rewards to education have increased over the past few decades, but men fail to benefit. In elementary and high school, male academic performance is lagging. Boys earn three-quarters of the D's and F's. By college, men are clearly behind. Only 40 percent of bachelor's degree go to men, along with 40 percent of master's degree. Thanks to their lower skills, men are dropping out of the labor force. In 1954, 96 percent of the American men between the ages of 25 and 54 worked. Today, that number is down to 80 percent. In Friday's jobs report, male labor force participation reached an all-time low. Millions of men are collecting disability benefits. Even many of those who do have a job are doing poorly. According to Michael Greenstone of the Hamilton Project, annual earnings for average prime-age males have dropped by 28 percent over the past 40 years. Men still dominate   the top of the corporate ladder because many women take time off to raise children, but women lead or are gaining nearly everywhere else. Women in their 20s outearn men in their 20s. Twelve out of the 15 fastest-growing professions are dominated by women. Over the years, many of us have employed a certain theory to explain men's economic decline. It is that the information-age economy rewards qualities that women are more likely to possess. To succeed today, you have to be able to sit still and focus attention in school at an early age. You have to be emotionally sensitive and aware of context. You have to communicate smoothly. For genetic and cultural reasons, many men are not good at these. But, in her fascinating new book, The End of Men, Hanna Rosin suggests a different theory. It has to do with adaptability. Women, Rosin argues, are like immigrants   who have moved to a new country. They see a new social context, and they flexibly adapt to .new circumstances. Men are like immigrants who have physically moved to a new country but who have kept their minds in the old one. They speak the old language. They follow the old customs. Men are more likely to be rigid; women are more fluid. This theory has less to do with born qualities and more to do with social position. When there's big social change, the people who were on the top of the old order are bound to stick to the old ways. The people who were on the bottom are bound to experience a burst of energy. They are going to explore their new surroundings more enthusiastically. Rosin reports from working-class Alabama. The women she meets are flooding into new jobs and new opportunities -- going back to college, pursuing new careers. The men are waiting around for the jobs left and are never coming back. They are strangely immune  to new options. In the Auburn-Opelika region, the average female income is 140 percent of the average male income. Rosin is not saying that women are winners in a global gender   war or that they are doing super simply because men are doing worse. She's just saying women are adapting to today's economy more flexibly than men. There's a lot of evidence to support her case. A study by the National Federation of Independent Business found that small businesses owned by women outperformed male-owned small business during the last recession  . In finance, women who switch firms are more likely to see their performance improve, whereas men are likely to see theirs decline. There's even evidence that women are better able to adjust to divorce. Today, more women than men see their incomes rise by 25 percent after a marital breakup. Forty years ago, men and women stuck to certain theory, what it meant to be a man or a woman. Young women today, Rosin argues, have abandoned both feminist  and prefeminist preconceptions. Men still stick to the masculinity  rules, which limit their vision and their movement. If she's right, then men will have to acknowledge that they are strangers in a strange land.

Drive-by hacking is the trendy term given to the practice of breaking into wireless computer networks from outside the buildings that house them. A recent study in the UK, sponsored by RSA Data Security, found that two-thirds of organizations with wireless networks were risking their data in this way. Security experts patrolled   several streets in the City of London seeking evidence of wireless networks in operation. Of 124 that they identified, 83 were sending data without encrypting them. Such data could readily be picked up by a passer-by armed only with a portable computer, a wireless modem and a few pieces of software that can be freely downloaded from the Internet. The data could include sensitive company documents containing valuable information. Or they could be e-mail identities and passwords that could be used by hackers to log into corporate networks as if they were legal users. Most companies using wireless networking technology do not take even the simplest of measures to protect their data. Nearly all wireless network technology comes with some basic security features that need only to be activated   in order to give a minimum level of security, for example, by encrypting the data being passed over the network.

Sometimes the name of a grandparent or other member of the family is used. Some parents choose the name of a well-known person. A boy could be named George Washington Smith; a girl could be named Helen Keller Jones. Some people give their children names that mean good things. Clara means \"bright\"; Beatrice means \"one who gives happiness\"; Donald means \"world ruler\"; Leonard means \"as brave as a lion\". The earliest last names, or surnames, were taken from place names. A family with the name Brook or Brooks probably lived near brook ; someone who was called Longstreet probably lived on a long, paved road. The Greenwood family lived in or near a leafy forest. Other early surnames came from people's occupations. The most common occupational name is Smith, which means a person who makes things with iron or other metals. In the past, smiths were very important workers in every town and village. Some other occupational names are: Carter -- a person who owned or drove a cart; Potter -- a person who made pots and pans. The ancestors of the Baker family probably baked bread for their neighbors in their native village. The Carpenter's great-great-great-grandfather probably built houses and furniture. Sometimes people were known for the color of their hair or skin, or their size, or their special abilities. When there were two men who were named John in the same village, the John with the gray hair probably became John Gray. Or the John was very tall could call himself John Tallman. John Fish was probably an excellent swimmer and John Lightfoot was probably a fast runner or a good dancer. Some family names were made by adding something to the father's name. English-speaking people added -s or -son. The Johnsons are descendants of John; the Roberts family's ancestor was Robert. Irish and Scottish people added Mac or Mc or O. Perhaps all of the MacDonnell's and the McDonnell's and the O'Donnell's are _ of the same Donnell. Suppose an English couple whose ancestors lived near a leafy forest wanted their new-born son to become a world leader, the baby might be named   _  .", "subject": ""}

Their tug-of-war match is a little different from ours. They have eight players for each team, while we may have the match between two sides with equal men or women players. Of course, they are usually tall, strong and heavy.  For a tug-of-war match, we need a long thick rope. Each team stands at one end of the rope, holding it. Then they try to pull the center of the rope, marked in the ground towards each of their own sides. The team which succeeds in pulling the center of the rope away through a certain distance is the winner.  Many foreign sport experts think we don't have to be tall, heavy and strong to play tug-of-war. We needn't have endless energy, for a match lasts only a few minutes. The secret is good hands. The players must have big, strong and hard hands. Before they start the match, they put a mixture of oil and petrol on their hands so they can hold the rope better. Many foreign experts say the best hands for tug-of-war belong to the sons of farmers. This is because they have to work hard when they are still very young. Farming is a good practice for this sport!

{"answer": 2, "choices": ["Children will not achieve academic and career success with few chores.", "It makes little difference when children begin chores.", "Chores should be given to children at an early age.", "Young adults beginning chores as teens are more likely to be responsible."], "question": "Today's demands for measuring childhood success have chased household chores from the to-do lists of many young people. In a survey of 1,001 US adults released by Braun Research, 82% reported having regular chores growing up, but only 28% said that they require their own children to do them. \"Parents today want their kids spending time on things that can bring them success, but ironically, we've stopped doing one thing that's actually been a proven predictor of success--and that's household chores.\" says Richard Rende, a developmental psychologist. Giving children household chores at an early age helps to build a lasting sense of mastery, responsibility and independence, according to research by Marty Rossmann, professor at the University of Minnesota. In 2002, Dr. Rossmann analyzed data from a longitudinal  study that followed 84 children across four periods. She found that young adults who began chores at ages 3 and 4 were more likely to have good relationships with family and friends and to achieve academic and early career success, as compared with those who didn't have chores or who started them as teens. Chores also teach children how to be empathetic  and responsive to others' needs, notes psychologist Richard Weissbourd. In research, his team surveyed 10,000 high-school students and asked them to rank what they treasured more: achievement, happiness or caring for others. Almost 80% chose either achievement or happiness over caring for others. As he points out, however, research suggests that personal happiness comes most reliably not from high achievement but from strong relationships. \"We're out of balance,\" says Dr. Weissbourd. A good way to start re-adjusting priorities , he suggests, is by learning to be kind and helpful at home. The next time that your child asks to skip chores to do homework, resist the urge to let him or her off the hook. Being slack  about chores when they compete with school sends your child the message that grades and achievement are more important than caring about others. What may seem like small messages in the moment but add up to big ones over time. What can we conclude from Rossmann's longitudinal study?", "subject": ""}

For three years Katie received a lot of treatment at the Nemours Hospital for Children in Wilmington, Delaware and with the help of wonderful doctors, kind nurses, whom Steve and his wife Michelle called heroes, Katie's leukemia was cured  . Forever changed by the experience and encouraged by the heroes at Nemours who saved his daughter's life, Steve felt he couldn't go back to business as usual. He felt there was something else he was meant to do and that something else led him to join the Nemours Foundation at the age of 28. The job change came with a 65% pay cut from what he was making as a lawyer, but Steve thought he was right and it was more important to help those who need help. Steve is glad to have made such a choice. Katie is now a healthy 20-year-old college student and Steve is one of the leaders of the Nemours Foundation. In three weeks Steve will have a party for Katie's 21st birthday, and give big thanks to the Nemours by riding his bicycle from Nemours in Jack-sonville, Florida to Wilmington, Delaware. He'll ride 900 miles in 9 days and raise $100,000 for the Nemours Foundation with the hope of saving more children's lives. Steve will ride 900 miles in 9 days to   _  .", "subject": ""}

It was winter, and on that particular night, the wind was really blowing. As my mom and I headed towards the restaurant from our car, a girl about my age and her mother came up to us. They asked if we had any spare change. My mom immediately asked where they kept their things. They pointed to an old car in a parking across the street. The girl said there were six of them living in that car, which was the same size as my own family. My mom said she had something to do after handing the people a few dollars. She sent me inside the restaurant with my dad and my three siblings. But she didn't come. Later, I found out she had gone home and practically emptied our cupboards into a few bags. Then, she brought that food over to the car and handed the bags to the family. I wasn't there when that part happened, but I can only imagine the joy it brought to their faces. A few days later, when I actually found out about what she had done, I asked her why she helped those people. She told me that they were not lucky. I remember the face of that girl who had asked us for change, she was the same age as me, yet we looked so different. Here I stood, dressed in almost new clothes, headed to dine in a restaurant and then back home to the bedroom I shared with my younger sister.

Instead of curving down and covering the finger normally, they 'll start to rise up on the sides and front, like the part of a spoon that holds liquid. 5. Kidney and liver problems can create \"half-and-half nails\", where one part of the nail is white and the other part dark or pink, according to Derick.

The family, who lives in Utah, will still put up decorations, but presents from Santa are a no-go this year. \"John and I feel like we are fighting a very hard uphill battle with our kids when it comes to their rights,\" Henderson wrote on her blog. \"It is one of the biggest struggles as a parent these days in middle class America. Our kids have been acting so ungrateful lately. ... John said, \"We shouldn't just celebrate Christmas. And, so that's what we did.\" Instead, the Hendersons are putting the money they would have spent on gifts toward service projects in order to teach their three sons the \"pleasure of giving.\" The children will still receive gifts from grandparents and other family members, but this year, she said, their letters to Santa will be asking him to find someone who needs presents more than they do. In an interview with ABC News, 11-year-old Caleb Henderson admitted that he and his brothers had been behaving badly. \"We would hit each other. We were fighting and crying,\" he admitted, and Lisa said that _  But so far, Henderson told Fox News last week, the family is having a sudden turning this into a different kind of gift. They have already held a clothing drive and sent boxes of clothes and candy to a village in the Philippines that was hit hard last year by Typhoon Haiyan. \"The children were excited and kept wanting to give more and more,\" she reported on her blog. Many readers responded positively to Henderson's post. Some sharing their own stories of limiting Christmas in order to teach their children to be charitable  or grateful. \"As parents you're giving your kids something so much more special than a bunch of gifts on Christmas,\" one wrote. But Henderson received negative follow-ups as well on her blog. Responding to critics, she updated her blog with a statement that reads, in part: I just wanted to explain a couple of things. First, my kids are in no way hurt for things.... They have reacted by making gifts for each other and packing them into each other's stockings stealthily . They are learning exactly what we wanted them to learn, because they are not moving around feeling sorry for themselves. They are thinking of others. The second thing I wanted to explain is why I wrote this post. Some people seem to think I wrote this for attention. Ummm, the attention you get from posts like this is not good and actually extremely difficult to deal with.... The reason I wrote this post is I want to empower parents to feel like it's okay to take a stand. ...

Why do presents sometimes go wrong? And what do your choices (good and bad) reflect about your personal qualities? Choosing the right gift is an art, I believe. It calls for empathy -- the ability to put yourself into someone else's head and heart. We're all able to do this; in fact, we're born with a kind of natural empathy. After the earliest period of childhood, however, it needs to be reinforced   -- by our parents, teachers, friends. When it isn't, we're not able to understand other people's feelings as sharply. This can show in the gifts we select, and so can many other emotional   qualities. Think back to the presents you've given over the past year, the time and effort you put into your selection, how much you spent, your thoughts while you were shopping, and your feelings when the receiver opened the package. Keep in mind that what you choose displays your inner world. (Of course, you may express yourself differently with different friends, relatives, and other people you know.) We live in a society where exchanging presents is an important part of communication. Ignoring the tradition won't make it go away. If you really dislike such a tradition, tell your friends ahead of time. The best possible title for this passage is \"  _  \".", "subject": ""}

Three minutes went by, and a middle aged man noticed there was musician playing. He slowed his pace, and stopped for a few seconds, and then hurried up to meet his schedule.

The one who paid the most attention was a 3-year-old boy. His mother tagged him along, hurried, but the kid stopped to look at the violinist.

Perhaps yes. Scientists have found the gene that determines skin colour. The gene comes in two versions, one of which is found in 99 per cent of Europeans. The other is found in 93 to 100 per cent of Africans, researchers at Pennsylvania State University report in the latest issue of Science. Scientists have changed the colour of a dark-striped zebra fish to uniform gold by inserting a version of the pigment   gene into a young fish. As with humans, zebra fish skin colour is determined by pigment cells, which contain melanosomes  . The number, size and darkness of melanosomes per pigment cell determines skin colour. It appears that, like the golden zebra fish, light-skinned Europeans also have a mutation  in the gene for melanosome production. This results in less pigmented skin. However, Keith Cheng, leader of the research team, points out that the mutation is different in human and zebra fish genes. Humans acquired dark skin in Africa about 1.5 million years ago to protect bodies from ultra-violet rays of the sun, which can cause skin cancer. But when modern humans leave Africa to live in northern latitudes, they need more sunlight on their skin to produce vitamin D. So the related gene changes, according to Cheng. Asians have the same version of the gene as Africans, so they probably acquired their light skin through the action of some other gene that affects skin colours, said Cheng.

Every Friday, which was the day of rest in that far land, the magician paid his respects to the king and his court, but secretly he desired to take away the king's throne.       One day he disguised   himself as an old woman and walked under the trees in the palace gardens till he met Safia. \"Princess,\" he said, \"let me be your laundress, for I can wash linens and silks as finely as anyone in the world, and I would do it for almost nothing if I could serve Your Highness.\"  \"Good woman,\" said Princess Safia, \"I can see that you are a poor creature and grieve   for your condition. Come to my private quarters and I shall give you some of my linen to wash.\"      So the disguised magician followed the princess into the palace, and before the girl could see what was happening he bundled her into a laundry bag and ran away as fast as his legs would carry him. He took the princess into his private room. Muttering a magic spell, he made her as small as a doll, and put her in a cupboard.

The Economic Mobility Project, an ambitious research led by Pew Charitable Trusts, looked at the economic fortunes of a large group of families over time, comparing the income of parents in the late 1960s with the income of their children in the late 1990s and early 2000s.

They want to fly, or to become a dinosaur, or to learn how to act like Spiderman. Luka Tavcar, 12, has muscular dystrophy   and is totally dependent on his wheelchair. Nevertheless, late last year, he had an inspired plan: to be photographed walking around and having fun. He approached Matej Peljhan, an amateur photographer and a psychologist at CIRIUS rehabilitation   center near Ljubljana, Slovenia, where Luka is a patient. At first, Peljhan was perplexed.

For example, you're more likely to remember a face that your've seen on some occasions over a few days than one that you've seen once in one long period.

This idea, called the encoding variability hypothesis ,was proposed by psychologists about 40 years ago.     Each different context or setting activates a clear set of brain regions; the hypothesis suggests that it is these differing neural responses that improve the memory. But neuroimaging research led by Russell Poldrack, a scientist at the University of Texas.

He once made angry an audience of young Mormon  women, many of whom wished to stay home with future children, by explaining that homemakers tend to be less attractive than their working-girl peers . \"Since beautiful women tend to be paid more,they have more motivation to stay in the work force,\" he says. The pursuit of good looks drives several huge industries--in 2010, Americans spent  $845 million on face-lifts alone--but few economists focused on beauty's financial power until the mid-1990s,when Hamermesh and his colleague, Jeff Biddle of Michigan State University, became the first scholars to track the effect of appearance on earnings potential for a large sample  of adults. Like many other desirable commodities , \"beauty is rare,\"  Hamermesh says, \"and that rareness commands a price.\" A handsome man is estimated to make 13 percent more during his career than a \"looks-challenged\" peer, according to calculations in Hamermesh's recent book, Beauty Pays. Interestingly, the net benefit is slightly less for pretty women, who may make up the difference by trading on their looks to marry men with higher earning potential. And some studies have shown that attractive people are more likely to be hired in a recession . Hamermesh argues that \"there's not much we can do to improve our pulchritude \". There are even studies suggesting that for every dollar spent on cosmetic  products,only 4 cents returns as salary--making lipstick a truly awful investment.  _ . One 2006 study showed that the less beautiful may actually profit from their lack of looks. People tend to expect less from the unattractive, so when they go beyond those low expectations they are rewarded. And the beautiful ones are often primarily  held to a higher standard-- \"then hit with a 'beauty penalty'  if they fail to deliver.\" Hamermesh says.

{"answer": 2, "choices": ["6.5.", "13.", "52.", "65."], "question": "New crime prediction software should reduce not only the murder rate, but the rate of other crimes. Developed by Richard Berk, a professor at the University of Pennsylvania, the software has already used in Baltimore and Philadelphia to predict which individuals on probation  or parole  are most likely to murder and to be murdered. \"When a person goes on probation or parole he is supervised  by an officer. The question is 'what level of supervision is appropriate?'\" said Berk. It used to be that parole officers used the person's criminal record, and their judgment to make decisions. \"This research replaces those _ ,\" he said. Technology helps determine level of supervision. On average there is one murder for every 100,000 people. Even among high-risk groups the murder rate is one in 100. Predicting such a rare event is very difficult, but advances in computer technology works. Years ago, the researchers made a dataset of more than 60,000 various crimes. Using the software they developed, they found some much more likely to commit murder when paroled or probated. They could identify eight future murderers out of 100. Berk's software examines roughly two dozen variables , from criminal record to geographic location. The type of crimes, and more importantly, the age at which that crime was committed, were two of the most predictive variables. \"People assume that if someone murdered then they will murder in the future,\" said Berk. \" What really matters is what that person did as a young individual. Predicting future crimes sounds well. But we aren't anywhere near being able to do that.\" \"Berk's scientific answer leaves policymakers with difficult questions. By labeling one group of people as high risk, and supervise them closely, there should be fewer murders, which the potential victims should be happy about. It also means that those high-risk individuals will be supervised more aggressively. For human rights advocates, that means punishing people who, most likely, will not commit a crime in the future,\" said Bushway. \"It comes down to a question of whether you would rather make these errors or those errors.\" For 650 people with crime records, how many potential murderers would the software find?", "subject": ""}

They might eat poisonous leaves, fall off a tree or let their prey   slip away. By watching others fail, an animal can avoid making the same mistakes, thus improving its chance of survival. Scientists suspected that one part of the brain helps animals process information about others' errors. Cells in that part appear to become more active when a person sees someone else making a mistake. But researchers didn't know whether individual cells in this part of the brain play different roles in _ errors. To investigate the brain's response to errors in more detail, the researchers taught a game to two macaques, a type of monkey. One monkey could press a yellow or green button while the other watched. If the first monkey pressed the right button, the team gave both animals a treat. Every couple of rounds, the two monkeys switched roles. Meanwhile, the scientists monitored individual cells in the animal's brains. When the first monkey messed up the game by pressing the wrong button, a group of cells in the second monkey's brain fired. But if the second monkey also made the wrong choice during its turn, some of the cells in that group didn't respond. Those unresponsive cells reacted specifically to mistakes made by others, not to the monkey's own mistakes. Scientists believe other parts of the brain also might help people process information about another's errors. \"You start to think about this other person and see things from his angle. \" Ellen de Bruijn, told Science News.

{"answer": 2, "choices": ["When a new discovery is made.", "At the beginning of summer and winter.", "On the longest and shortest days of the year.", "When they want to have a barbecue."], "question": "The people who built Stonehenge in southern England thousands of years ago had wild parties, eating barbecued pigs and breaking pottery. This is according to recent work by archaeologists--history experts who investigate   how human beings lived in the past. Archaeologists digging near Stonehenge last year discovered the remains of a large prehistoric village where they think the builders of the mysterious stone circle used to live. The village is about 4600 years old, the same age as Stonehenge and as old as the pyramids in Egypt. It is less than two miles from the famous ancient landmark and lies inside a massive manmade circular dirt wall, or \"henge\", known as the Durrington Walls. Remains found at the site included jewellery, stone arrowheads, tools made of deer antlers, wooden spears and huge amounts of animal bones and broken pottery. \"These finds suggest Stone Age people went to the village at special times of the year to feast and party\", says Mike Parker Pearson from Sheffield University in England. He said many of the pig bones they found had been thrown away halfeaten. He also said the partygoers appeared to have shot some of the farm pigs with arrows, possibly as a kind of sport before barbecuing them. An ancient road which led from the village to the River Avon was also found. Here, the experts think, people came after their parties to throw dead relatives in the water so the bodies would be washed downstream to Stonehenge.

Every time we make irrational  demands, exhibit irresponsible behavior, or display any other signs of being normal American citizens, we are called childish.  _ A _ . After all, take a look at these events: imperialism and colonization , world wars, George W. Bush. Ask yourself: Who's responsible? Adults.                Now, what have kids done?  _ B _ .

So, as you can see evidenced by such examples, age has  ly nothing to do with it. We are called childish so often by adults that we should abolish this age-discrimination when it comes to criticizing behavior associated with irresponsibility and irrational thinking.                Then again, who's to say that certain types of irrational thinking aren't exactly what the world needs?

Kids can be full of inspiring aspirations and hopeful thinking, like my wish that no one went hungry or that everything were free kind of utopia .

On the other hand, we kids still dream about perfection.  _ D _ . And that's a good thing because in order to make anything a reality, you have to dream about it first. Now, our inborn wisdom doesn't have to be insiders' knowledge. Kids already do a lot of learning from adults, and we have a lot to share. I think that adults should start learning from kids. Now, I do most of my speaking in front of an education crowd, teachers and students, and I like this analogy. It shouldn't just be a teacher at the head of the classroom telling students to do this, do that. The students should teach their teachers. Learning between grown ups and kids should be reciprocal. The reality, unfortunately, is a little different, and it has a lot to do with trust, or a lack of it. Now, if you don't trust someone, you place restrictions on them, right. If I doubt my older sister's ability to pay back the 10 percent interest I established on her last loan, I'm going to withhold her ability to get more money from me until she pays it back.

Kids have no, or very little, say in making the rules, when really the attitude should be reciprocal , meaning that the adult population should learn and take into account the wishes of the younger population.

Further education thus embraces the vast range of university, technical, commercial, and art education and the wide field of adult education. It is this sector of education, which is concerned with education beyond the normal school-leaving ages of 16 or 18, that has experienced the most astonishing growth in the number of students. In the 19th century the dominance  of Oxford and Cambridge was challenged by the rise of the civic  universities, such as London, Manchester, and Birmingham. Following the lead of the 18th century German universities and responding to a public demand for increased opportunity for higher education, Britain's new civic universities quickly acquired recognition--not only in technological fields but also in the fine and liberal arts. Many new post-school technical colleges were founded in the early 20th century. The Fisher Act of 1918 empowered the local authorities to levy  a rate (tax) to finance such colleges. The universities, on the other hand, received funds from the central government through the University Grants Committee, established in 1911 and recognized in 1920, after World War I. A new type of technical college was established in the 1960s--the polytechnic, which provides mainly technological courses of university level as well as courses of a general kind in the arts and sciences.

After receiving master's degree in MIT, he went to study in California Institute of Technology and received PhD degrees in both aerospace and mathematics. In 1955, six years after the founding of People's Republic of China, Qian Xuesen returned to his motherland. His return brought China the hope of developing space science and its own missiles. In 1956, Qian Xuesen put forward \"Proposal on the Development of China's Aviation Industry for National Defense\".

Rowling set children's imaginations on fire. Can the creator of Harry Potter do the same for a grown-up audience? The British author will find out on September 27, when more than 2 million hardcover  copies of her first novel for adults hit bookstores in the UK and the US, along with the digital edition. Set in a little English town, The Casual Vacancy is about an election held after an unexpected death. Michael Pietsch, Rowling's US publisher, says the novel reminded him of Dickens \"because of the humanity, the humor, the social concerns, the intensely real characters\". No magic though, apparently: \"This book isn't Harry Potter\", says Pietsch. \"It is a completely different concern\". As with Harry Potter, there are no advance copies for the media, no early reviews. To date, the seven-book series has sold more than 450 million copies worldwide, and it became one of the most successful movie franchises in July 21, 2007. Back then, fans could buy books at midnight parties hosted by bookstores. But recent years have seen a great challenge for brick-and-mortar  bookstores. People are still buying books, indeed more books than in 2007, according to figures released by the Association of American Publishers. But they are reading them in a new format --the e-book. The Harry Potter series just became available digitally for the first time in April. It will be different for The Casual Vacancy, with the publisher _ releasing an e-book. For Rowling fans who once queued up for Harry Potter, this means that instant satisfaction is now only a click away. Moving from children's books to adult literature is a big transition. Will Rowling's new book be successful? Arthur Levine, the US co-editor of the Harry Potter books, seems confident: \"If you read or re-read the Harry Potter books, you can see that Rowling has all the strengths she needs for great success as a fiction writer -you have great characters, an involving plot, a sense of humor and great empathy\".

{"answer": 0, "choices": ["be likely to eat less", "be happy to take in food", "enjoy the sound of it", "consume more food"], "question": "The sounds you make while chewing have a significant effect on the amount of food you eat, a new study has found. The results suggest that people are likely to consume less if they can hear themselves eating. Researchers at Brigham Young University and Colorado State University have found that your TV, radio, and computer are making you fat. Not by bombarding  you with food ads (though they totally are) but by blocking the sounds of your chewing. In a recent study, they found that the noise your food makes while you're eating can have a significant effect on how much food you eat. \"Sound is typically labeled as the forgotten food sense,\" adds Ryan Elder, assistant professor of marketing at BYU's Marriott School of Management. \"But if people are more focused on the sound the food makes, it could reduce consumption.\" \"For the most part, consumers and researchers have overlooked food sound as an important sensory cue  in the eating experience.\" said study coauthor Gina Mohr, an assistant professor of marketing at CSU. The team carried out three separate experiments to quantify the effects of \"food sound salience\" on quantity of food consumed during a meal.

Not only did I know that most of the town people had already ignored her, judging by where I found her, but I knew that if she had gotten into the Woods, the \"cross\" that she dragged behind her would have wrapped around a tree until starvation or thirst killed her. She has a beautiful name now. Already in the first week she has come to look more like she should. Her eyes sparkle and she has learned to wag her tail in greeting. She has stopped flinching   when I make a sudden movement, because she knows now that I won't beat her, in fact, she rarely leaves my side.

A recent experiment suggests that the answer to that question may depend on your age. Martin Doherty, a psychologist at the University of Stirling in Scotland, led the team of scientists. In this experiment, Doherty and his team tested the perception  of some people, using pictures of some orange circles. The researchers showed the same pictures to two groups of people. The first group included 151 children aged 4 to 10, and the second group included 24 adults aged 18 to 25. The first group of pictures showed two circles alone on a white background. One of the circles was larger than the other, and these people were asked to identify the larger one. Four-year-olds identified the correct circle 79 percent of the time. Adults identified the correct circle 95 percent of the time. Next, both groups were shown a picture where the orange circles, again of different sizes, were surrounded by gray circles. Here's where the trick lies in. In some of the pictures, the smaller orange circle was surrounded by even smaller gray circles -- making the orange circle appear larger than the other orange circle, which was the real larger one. And the larger orange circle was surrounded by even bigger gray circles -- so it appeared to be smaller than the real smaller orange circle. When young children aged 4 to 6 looked at these tricky pictures, they weren't fooled -- they were still able to find the bigger circle with roughly the same accuracy as before. Older children and adults, on the other hand, did not do as well. Older children often identified the smaller circle as the larger one, and adults got it wrong most of the time. As children get older, Doherty said, their brains may develop the ability to identify visual context.

Here's where the trick lies in. In some of the pictures, the smaller orange circle was surrounded by even smaller gray circles -- making the orange circle appear larger than the other orange circle, which was the real larger one. And the larger orange circle was surrounded by even bigger gray circles -- so it appeared to be smaller than the real smaller orange circle. When young children aged 4 to 6 looked at these tricky pictures, they weren't fooled -- they were still able to find the bigger circle with roughly the same accuracy as before. Older children and adults, on the other hand, did not do as well. Older children often identified the smaller circle as the larger one, and adults got it wrong most of the time. As children get older, Doherty said, their brains may develop the ability to identify visual context. In other words, they will begin to process the whole picture at once: the tricky gray circles, as well as the orange circle in the middle. As a result, they're more likely to fall for this kind of visual trick. Why are younger children not fooled?", "subject": ""}

Not if the architect is 31-year-old Bryan Berg. He's made a career out of building fantastic card houses, stadiums, capitols, castles -- and the world's tallest card tower. How does he do it? Bryan's structures are amazing because they are made entirely of perfectly balanced, freestanding playing cards. He never uses glue, tape, or anything else to hold the cards together. Nor does he fold the cards. He's discovered another way to make a strong house of cards, using a trick from nature. To make plants strong, nature builds them with cells that have tough walls. Rows and rows of these cells form a grid  that helps leaves and stems keep their shape. Bees use the same kind of repeating pattern to create strong honeycombs, where they live and store honey. Bryan designs similar grids, using cards to create a repeating pattern of cells. He begins with a single cell made by balancing four cards against one another to form a box. Then he repeats the cell over and over, expanding outward to form the grid, which makes a good foundation for a strong card structure. The larger the grid, the more weight it can carry. Sometimes Bryan uses several cards, instead of just one, to construct the cell walls, making the grid even stronger. The trick, he tells kids when he speaks in classrooms, is to place your cards as tightly together as possible when laying out your grid, making sure the cards are not leaning at all. After building this solid base, Bryan lays cards across the top to make the floor for the next \"story\" of the building. He may add towers, columns, steeples, or domes.

Bryan's structures are amazing because they are made entirely of perfectly balanced, freestanding playing cards. He never uses glue, tape, or anything else to hold the cards together. Nor does he fold the cards. He's discovered another way to make a strong house of cards, using a trick from nature. To make plants strong, nature builds them with cells that have tough walls. Rows and rows of these cells form a grid  that helps leaves and stems keep their shape. Bees use the same kind of repeating pattern to create strong honeycombs, where they live and store honey. Bryan designs similar grids, using cards to create a repeating pattern of cells. He begins with a single cell made by balancing four cards against one another to form a box. Then he repeats the cell over and over, expanding outward to form the grid, which makes a good foundation for a strong card structure. The larger the grid, the more weight it can carry. Sometimes Bryan uses several cards, instead of just one, to construct the cell walls, making the grid even stronger. The trick, he tells kids when he speaks in classrooms, is to place your cards as tightly together as possible when laying out your grid, making sure the cards are not leaning at all. After building this solid base, Bryan lays cards across the top to make the floor for the next \"story\" of the building. He may add towers, columns, steeples, or domes. Using the principle of repeating cells, Bryan builds structures of amazing strength. In the Cards Not surprisingly, Bryan has always been interested in building things. Growing up on a \"big, old farm\" in rural Iowa, he had plenty of room to play. \"We were in the middle of nowhere,\" Bryan remembers, \"with lots of space to do whatever we wanted. I was always making something, using things like sticks or bales of hay.\" Bryan's grandfather taught him how to stack cards. Bryan's two interests -- building and card stacking -- soon combined. But stacking in his family's farmhouse was challenging. \"Our old house had wood floors that weren't all level,\" he reports. \"And they weren't very firm. When people walked around, it was like 'earthquake action.' It was a challenge to build something that wouldn't fall down immediately.\" Bryan constructed tower after tower; he went through a lot of trial and error before he built anything taller than himself. When he placed a few decks of cards on top of his grid, he discovered how strong it was. Bryan's towers began to grow taller. How Tall Is Too Tall? Bryan's first Guinness World Record for the world's tallest card tower came in the spring of 1992, when he was in high school. Learning that the world record was 12 feet 10 inches, Bryan built a slim tower that topped out at 14 feet 6 inches. Done as a project for his geometry class, it took him 40 hours and 208 decks of cards. Since then he's gone on to win world records for even taller buildings. His latest winner measured 25 feet 3.5 inches and used about 2,400 decks of cards. _  Why don't these towers fall down? The key is in a good solid base, a repeating pattern of stories, and a tapering top. Bryan likes to point out how card buildings resemble real ones. They are built cell by cell, story by story. The separate parts make one strong whole. The heavier the building, the stronger and more stable it is. But the weight can't all be at the top. After spending so much time building something so cool, Bryan admits it's sometimes painful to see his structures destroyed. But he compares his work to the building of a sandcastle or an ice sculpture. \"They wouldn't be as special if they were permanent,\" he points out. \"My buildings are like snowdrifts, or clouds in the sky. They can't last forever. Why was it a challenge for Bryan to build card structures in his family's farmhouse?", "subject": ""}
{"answer": 1, "choices": ["86 years old.", "93 years old.", "98 years old.", "88 years old."], "question": "During her sixty-year career performing, Lena Horne entertained people with her beauty and rich, emotional voice. She used her fame to fight social injustices toward African-Americans. Lena Horne was born in New York in 1917. At sixteen, Lena became a dancer at the famous Club in New York City. After taking voice lessons, she soon became a singer. In 1940, Lena Horne became the first African-American to perform with an all-white jazz band. After performing at a club in Hollywood, California, she caught the attention of filmmakers. She soon began making movies. Her films became very popular. In the 1940's, Lena Horne was the first African-American in Hollywood to sign a long-term contract with a major movie studio. Her deal with MGM stated that she would never play the role of a servant. She refused to play roles that represented African-Americans disrespectfully . But this refusal also limited her movie career. Lena Horne once said that World War Two helped make her a star. She was popular with both black and white soldiers. She sang on army radio programs and traveled to perform for the troops. Once, she noted that German prisoners of war were permitted to sit closer to the stage than black soldiers. She was very angry. These experiences led to Lena Horne's work in the civil rights movement. Lena Horne sang at civil rights gatherings. She took part in the March on Washington protest in 1963. It was during this event that Martin Luther King Junior gave his \"I Have a Dream\" speech. She protested racial separation at the hotels where she performed.

Activities are planned in more than twenty countries to get millions of people in the developing world to wash their hands with soap. Experts say people around the world wash their hands but very few use soap at so-called extremely moments. These include after using the toilet,after cleaning a baby and before touching food. Global Handwashing Day is the idea of the Public Private Partnership for handwashing with soap. The goal,they say,is to create a culture of handwashing with soap. The organizers say all soaps are equally effective at removing disease-causing germs  .They say the correct way to wash is to wet your hands with a small amount of water and cover them with soap. Rub it into all areas,including under the fingernails. Then,wash well under running water. Finally,dry your hands with a clean cloth. The Partnership says soap is important because it increases the time that people spend washing. Soap also helps to break up the dirt that holds most of the germs. And it usually  leaves a pleasant smell,which increases the chances that people will wash again. It also says that washing hands with soap before eating and after using the toilet could save more lives than any medicine. It could help reduce cases of diarrhea  ,which is the second leading cause of child deaths,killing more than one and a half million children a year,by almost half. Which fact can't explain why soap is important?", "subject": ""}

All but two pieces sold, fetching more than PS70m, a record for a sale by a single artist. It was a last victory. As the auctioneer called out bids, in New York one of the oldest banks on Wall Street, Lehman Brothers, filed for bankruptcy, starting the most severe financial crisis since the 1920s. The world art market had already been losing momentum  for a while after rising confusingly since 2003. At its peak in 2007 it was worth some $65 billion, thinks Clare McAndrew, founder of Arts Economics, a research firm -- double the figure five years earlier. Since then it may have come down to $50 billion. But the market generates interest far beyond its size because it brings together great wealth, enormous egos , greed, passion and controversy in a way matched by few other industries. In the weeks and months that followed Mr. Hirst's sale, spending of any sort became deeply unfashionable. In the art world that meant collectors stayed away from galleries and salerooms. Sales of contemporary art fell by two-thirds, and in the most overheated sector, they were down by nearly 90% in the year to November 2008. Within weeks the world's two biggest auction houses, Sotheby's and Christie's, had to pay out nearly $200m in guarantees to clients who had placed works for sale with them. The current downturn in the art market is the worst since the Japanese stopped buying Impressionists at the end of 1989. This time experts suppose that prices are about 40% down on their peak on average, though some have been far more volatile  . But Edward Dolman, Christie's chief executive, says, \"I'm pretty confident we're at the bottom.\" What makes this fall different from the last, he says, is that there are still buyers in the market, while in the early 1990s, when interest rates were high, there was no demand even though many collectors wanted to sell. Christie's earnings in the first half of 2009 were still higher than in the first half of 2006. Almost everyone who was interviewed for this special report said that the biggest problem at the moment is not a lack of demand but a lack of good work to sell. The three Ds -- death, debt and divorce -- still deliver works of art to the market. But anyone who does not have to sell is keeping away, waiting for confidence to return.

In the weeks and months that followed Mr. Hirst's sale, spending of any sort became deeply unfashionable. In the art world that meant collectors stayed away from galleries and salerooms. Sales of contemporary art fell by two-thirds, and in the most overheated sector, they were down by nearly 90% in the year to November 2008. Within weeks the world's two biggest auction houses, Sotheby's and Christie's, had to pay out nearly $200m in guarantees to clients who had placed works for sale with them. The current downturn in the art market is the worst since the Japanese stopped buying Impressionists at the end of 1989. This time experts suppose that prices are about 40% down on their peak on average, though some have been far more volatile  . But Edward Dolman, Christie's chief executive, says, \"I'm pretty confident we're at the bottom.\" What makes this fall different from the last, he says, is that there are still buyers in the market, while in the early 1990s, when interest rates were high, there was no demand even though many collectors wanted to sell. Christie's earnings in the first half of 2009 were still higher than in the first half of 2006. Almost everyone who was interviewed for this special report said that the biggest problem at the moment is not a lack of demand but a lack of good work to sell. The three Ds -- death, debt and divorce -- still deliver works of art to the market. But anyone who does not have to sell is keeping away, waiting for confidence to return.

So, scientists are exploring the planet for plants that do not need as much water as today's crops. The Mojave Desert in the US state of California is home to some of these plants. Scientist Heather Rose Kates of the University of Florida is in that desert. She is searching along roads for a plant called coyote melon which is a kind of squash .Coyote melon may not taste good, but it can be grown in places that have little rainfall. The desert where it grows gets just 15 to 20 centimeters of rain per year, or less. Other kinds of squash need at least two and a half centimeters per week to grow. Scientists are considering combining wild coyote melon with regular squash to see if they can make a tasty vegetable that doesn't need as much water to grow. That could be useful on a planet growing warmer and more crowded every day. Andy Jarvis works at the International Center for Tropical Agriculture.

When the fighter was 7km away from the airport, however, the engine stopped working. The plane began to fall at a speed of 25 meters a second from an altitude of 1,160 meters. Under Air Force rules fighter pilots may eject if their aircraft loses engine power below 2,000 meters and can't be restarted. Before Li lost contact with the control tower, the commander in the air base asked him to eject. But Li Feng insisted on having another try. \"I knew where the deadline (to abandon the aircraft) was and was prepared for the ejection, but I decided not to give up unless the fighter was totally out of control,\" Li recalled during a recent television interview. After 104 seconds, Li was able to bring the fighter to a safe landing. The plane only suffered slight damage. \"You are a hero! Congratulations!\" Li's teacher, Xu yongling wrote in a text message to him after the landing. He said Li was a cool-headed pilot and very professional. Li's brave and calm act not only saved the 200 million yuan aircraft but also gave him invaluable first-hand experience of dealing with an engine emergency. For his outstanding performance, the Air Force recently awarded him a gold medal. What is the best title for the passage?", "subject": ""}

It turns out our opening words speak volumes--people take less than a second to form an impression of someone's personality based on their voice alone.   We know that our voices can convey information about our sex, age, even body strength and certain personality characteristics, but Phil McAleer at the University of Glasgow and his colleagues wondered whether we make an instant impression. To find out, they recorded 64 volunteers as they read a passage. They then picked the word \"hello\" and asked 320 listeners to mark the voices for personality characteristics--including trust, dominance and attractiveness.   Although it's not clear how accurate such immediate judgements are, what is obvious is that we all make them, and very quickly. \"We were surprised by just how similar people's marks were,\" says McAleer.

Best known for his CNN, Ted Turner launched a second nationwide all-news network, Headline News, purchased the Atlanta Braves baseball team, and became the world's best yachtsman at the America's Cup in 1977. In 1982 Ted Turner was named by Forbes one of the 400 richest people in the US. He was named Time magazine's \"Man of the Year\" in 1992. How did Ted Turner accomplish all of this at such a young age? Ted Turner's father, Ed, was a self-made millionaire who demanded that his only son try to achieve similar success. He instilled in the boy a strong belief that hard work was good. Besides reading a new book every two days, Ted Turner was also charged rent at home during summer vacations from boarding school. Ed Turner was a strong influence in his son's life. As a child, Ted Turner lived a very lonely life, often separated from his family. During World War II, his father served in the Navy. Ed Turner took his wife and daughter with him so they could live nearby but left his 6yearold son behind in a boarding school in Cincinnati, Ohio. When Ted Turner was in the fifth grade, his father enrolled him in a military academy. Even though Turner had friends at school, it didn't make up for the absence of his parents and sister. Eventually Ted Turner enrolled at Brown University in Providence, Rhode Island. He attended college off and on, became involved in sailboat racing, and became a member of the U.S. Coast Guard for a while. In his early twenties, he became general manager of one of his father's branch offices -- the Turner Advertising Company in Macon, Georgia. Two years later after his father's suicide, Ted Turner took over the company. He soon discovered that he was more skilled than his father in managing the business. During the next twenty years, Ted Turner worked hard to accumulate enough power and money to fulfill his father's dream. Reflecting on his father's death, however, Ted Turner realized that it was dangerous to put too much emphasis on material possessions. He decided to use his hard-earned influence to serve the public. Concerned about the environment, Ted Turner established the Better World Society in 1985. The purpose of this organization was to produce documentaries to educate people about pollution, hunger, and the danger of building weapons of mass destruction. In 1986 Turner began sponsoring the Goodwill Games to promote world peace.

Best known for his CNN, Ted Turner launched a second nationwide all-news network, Headline News, purchased the Atlanta Braves baseball team, and became the world's best yachtsman at the America's Cup in 1977. In 1982 Ted Turner was named by Forbes one of the 400 richest people in the US. He was named Time magazine's \"Man of the Year\" in 1992. How did Ted Turner accomplish all of this at such a young age? Ted Turner's father, Ed, was a self-made millionaire who demanded that his only son try to achieve similar success. He instilled in the boy a strong belief that hard work was good. Besides reading a new book every two days, Ted Turner was also charged rent at home during summer vacations from boarding school. Ed Turner was a strong influence in his son's life. As a child, Ted Turner lived a very lonely life, often separated from his family. During World War II, his father served in the Navy. Ed Turner took his wife and daughter with him so they could live nearby but left his 6yearold son behind in a boarding school in Cincinnati, Ohio. When Ted Turner was in the fifth grade, his father enrolled him in a military academy. Even though Turner had friends at school, it didn't make up for the absence of his parents and sister. Eventually Ted Turner enrolled at Brown University in Providence, Rhode Island. He attended college off and on, became involved in sailboat racing, and became a member of the U.S. Coast Guard for a while. In his early twenties, he became general manager of one of his father's branch offices -- the Turner Advertising Company in Macon, Georgia. Two years later after his father's suicide, Ted Turner took over the company. He soon discovered that he was more skilled than his father in managing the business. During the next twenty years, Ted Turner worked hard to accumulate enough power and money to fulfill his father's dream. Reflecting on his father's death, however, Ted Turner realized that it was dangerous to put too much emphasis on material possessions. He decided to use his hard-earned influence to serve the public. Concerned about the environment, Ted Turner established the Better World Society in 1985. The purpose of this organization was to produce documentaries to educate people about pollution, hunger, and the danger of building weapons of mass destruction.

Is it a thing to be saved or spent or wasted, like money? Or is it something we have no control over, like the weather? Is time the same all over the world? That's an easy question, you say. Wherever you go, a minute is 60 seconds, an hour is 60 minutes, a day is 24 hours, and so forth. Well, maybe. But in America, time is more than that. Americans see time as a valuable resource. Maybe that's why they are fond of the expression, \"Time is money.\" To Americans, punctuality is a way of showing respect for other people's time. Being more than 10 minutes late to an appointment usually calls for an apology, and maybe an explanation. People who are running late often call ahead to let others know of the delay. Of course, the less formal the situation, the less important it is to be exactly on time. At informal get-togethers, for example, people often arrive as much as 30 minutes past the appointed time. But they usually don't try that at work. American lifestyles show how much people respect the time of others. When people plan an event, they often set the time days or weeks in advance. Once the time is fixed, it takes almost an emergency to change it. If people want to come to your house for a friendly visit, they will usually call first to make sure it is suitable. Only very close friends will just \"drop by\" unannounced. Also, people hesitate to call others late at night for fear they might be in bed.

Its students have won praise not only for doing this research but also for presenting their findings to groups of expert scientists. The school is one of the Super Science High Schools allowed by the Ministry of Education, Culture, Sports, Science, and Technology, where students are given an opportunity to study science at an advanced level. Here, students use the same type of hitech experimental laboratories as those found at universities. In these labs, they conduct experiments and research in new fields of study not found in textbooks. As part of this science course, the students, with the help of Hiroshima University, used a machine called sequencer  , and over the course of a year and a half they succeeded in decoding   the DNA. They then presented their results to academic groups. Achieving a world first might sound very wonderful, but the process of decoding the DNA involved very hard work. The students were also responsible for maintaining the equipment, and they had to read difficult research papers and put in extra study beyond their regular schoolwork. \"Researchers need to work hard. The work was tiring, but the students worked toward their ambitious goal of achieving a world first. They have a great sense of achievement, and the number of students who hope to become biologists has increased,\" said Taruma Akinori, who is in charge of the science course.

{"answer": 1, "choices": ["Full control by the user.", "Improvement in intelligence.", "Larger size of the robots.", "Help for the experienced users."], "question": "What if handheld   tools know what needs to be done and were even able to guide and help inexperienced users to complete jobs that require skill? Researchers at the University of Bristol have developed and started studying a novel concept in robotics--intelligent handheld robots. Historically, handheld tools have been straight, unintelligent instruments that are _ of the context they operate in, are fully directed by the user, and therefore, lack any understanding about the task they are performing. Dr. Walterio Mayol-Cuevas and PhD student, Austin Gregg-Smith, from the University's Department of Computer Science, have been working in the design of the robot as well as in understanding how best to be with a tool that \"knows and acts\". Compared to other tools such as power tools that have a motor and perhaps some basic sensors  , the handheld robots developed at Bristol are designed to have more degrees of freedom to allow greater independence from the instructions of the user, and importantly, understand the steps being carried out. This allows for a new level of co-operation between user and tool, such as the user providing directions and the tool performing the detailed task. Handheld robots, aim to share physical similarity with users but are neither fully independent as is a humanoid robot nor are part of the user's body. The aim with handheld robots is to develop the intuitiveness   of using traditional handheld tools while adding planted intelligence and action to allow for new abilities. Dr. Mayol-Cuevas, Reader in Robotics Computer Vision and Mobile Systems, said, \"There are three basic levels of autonomy   we are considering: no autonomy, semi-autonomous when the robot advises the user but does not act, and fully autonomous when the robot advises and acts even by correcting or refusing to perform incorrect user actions.\" What is the new concept in robotics?", "subject": ""}
