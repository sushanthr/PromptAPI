She informed me it was no good arguing with her and I should have read the sign, an almost invisible piece of card saying \"X-rays\" just in front of her where very few people can have seen it. No matter how hard I tried to persuade her, she wouldn't give me an appointment card for a blood test, so I started queuing again and finally got the card at 8: 30!

The Guardian   described the scene of a friend's face buried in a screen as \"a distinct 21st-century problem\". A new word has been created to describe this --- phubbing. It is the act of looking at your mobile phone instead of paying attention to others during a social interaction. Like pointing at one's nose, phubbing is widely considered rude behavior. People everywhere are beginning to lose patience with the phenomenon. A \"Stop Phubbing\" campaign group has been started in Australia and at least five others have sprung up in its wake as anger about the lack of manners grows. The campaign's creator, Alex Haigh, 23, from Melbourne, said, \"A group of friends and I were chatting when someone raised how annoying being ignored by people on mobiles was.\" He has created a website where companies can download posters to discourage phubbing. Phubbing is just one symptom of our increasing dependence on mobile phones and the Internet, which is replacing normal social interaction. A survey found that one out of three Britons would answer the phone in a restaurant and 19% said they would while being served in a shop. The survey came after a supermarket assistant in south London refused to serve a woman until she stopped using her phone.

{"answer": 1, "choices": ["In a telephone book.", "In a newspaper.", "In a travel guide.", "In a textbook."], "question": "It is not easy to reach Panjiayu, a village in the countryside around Thangshan, Hebei province. To get to the isolated village, visitors first have to take a bus ride of about an hour to the Fengrun district before taking a long-distance bus, which usually runs five times a day. Surrounded by mountains and bathed in plentiful sunlight, Panjiayu is nicknamed \"Turpan\", after the city in the Xinjiang Uygur Autonomous Region that is famous for its sweet grapes. The fruit is the Panjiayuy's main money spinner  ------ the courtyard of almost every home boasts at least one grape trellis , and the main road is enlaced  by vines. Last year, about 200,000 tourists from nearby cities visited Panjiayu. Even so, the place has retained its traditional feel. When night falls, except for a few road lamps that send out a dim light, the village is shrouded  in darkness, the silence only broken by the occasional bark of a dog. So why does this village of just 1,500 residents attract so many visitors? Grapes are only part of the reason; most of the tourists visit to commemorate a massacre  that happened 73 years ago. The modern building that seems so _ with the traditional feel of the place is a memorial to the events of Jan 25, 1941, two days before Lunar New Year, when the Japanese army carried out a frenzied  slaughter of unarmed villagers. \"About 1,298 of the 1,700 villagers were murdered. Of the survivors, 273 were not in the village that day, and although nearly 200 others survived, 98 of them were badly injured,\" said Pan Ruishen, the leader of the Panjiayu compensation  Team for Japanese Atrocities .

To get to the isolated village, visitors first have to take a bus ride of about an hour to the Fengrun district before taking a long-distance bus, which usually runs five times a day. Surrounded by mountains and bathed in plentiful sunlight, Panjiayu is nicknamed \"Turpan\", after the city in the Xinjiang Uygur Autonomous Region that is famous for its sweet grapes. The fruit is the Panjiayuy's main money spinner  ------ the courtyard of almost every home boasts at least one grape trellis , and the main road is enlaced  by vines. Last year, about 200,000 tourists from nearby cities visited Panjiayu. Even so, the place has retained its traditional feel. When night falls, except for a few road lamps that send out a dim light, the village is shrouded  in darkness, the silence only broken by the occasional bark of a dog. So why does this village of just 1,500 residents attract so many visitors? Grapes are only part of the reason; most of the tourists visit to commemorate a massacre  that happened 73 years ago. The modern building that seems so _ with the traditional feel of the place is a memorial to the events of Jan 25, 1941, two days before Lunar New Year, when the Japanese army carried out a frenzied  slaughter of unarmed villagers. \"About 1,298 of the 1,700 villagers were murdered. Of the survivors, 273 were not in the village that day, and although nearly 200 others survived, 98 of them were badly injured,\" said Pan Ruishen, the leader of the Panjiayu compensation  Team for Japanese Atrocities . Panjiayu was just one of many massacres committed by the Japanese during the occupation of China before and during World War II, however, it is now a patriotism-education base because the village is full of sites of historical interest, such as the big lotus tree, whose hollow trunk was used to hide secret files of the Eighth Route Army, and the metal doors at the village entrance, which are scarred with countless white marks left by Japanese bayonets .

Many worry about the right time or \"right age\" to start working out. But it's never too late to start exercising and all you need is enough determination. Here're some practical tips to help you get fit.  Master your mind--most people argue that they're too tired or old to start exercising. Doing so is much easier than trying to change the busy lifestyle. Change your mindset and be more confident in improving your health. Tell your body to be more active and say, \"I can do it.\" Easy does it--once you have chosen a fitness program, start slowly and increase it in stages. Begin with just a few minutes of gentle exercises and stretches. Go next to some mild activity such as walking, jogging or cycling. About 30 minutes should be devoted to your workout. As your body starts to respond and your muscles get used to the exercises, you can gradually increase the length of your workout.  Don't overload your body--there's no quick access to getting fit. It's a common mistake to do too much too soon. If you don't know how to balance your needs and your expectations, you might seriously injure your muscles or just create stress.  _ -- always remember to warm up your muscles before exercising. Gentle warm-ups will reduce your risk of injury, aches and pains, and increase blood circulation  and flexibility.  Cool down--when you finish your routine, you need to cool your muscles and let your heart rate slow gradually. Cooling down will help your body to return to its pre-exercise level.

{"answer": 0, "choices": ["Unsatisfying", "Favorable", "Pleasant", "Practical"], "question": "Twelve years ago, when I was 50,I wondered what 60 or 70 would be like? I looked around and saw only one style of living. It's not fair, I thought. Young people have so many styles to choose from, but older people have just one choice. So I decide to do something about it , something practical. I worked on my fitness by joining exercise classes in town. A few years later, my husband and I moved to a retirement community, and I wanted to teach aerobic classes. The community center wouldn't give me a room to teach in, so I had to walk around and find any available empty room. One day, the community center staff came to me and asked if I would help with the entertainment for a Hawaiian luau they were putting on. I said yes. Then I talked five other ladies into dancing with me. We performed the hula and a war chant and brought the house down. Someone had a camera and took pictures, and then sent them to our local paper. We got requests for more engagements, which in turn led to more publicity and yet more engagements. Soon we had invitations from all over the country. The Dancing Grannies were born!

The unbelieving expression \"Well, I'll be a monkey's uncle\" has its origin in bitter disbelief over Darwin's writings on evolution. These colourful expressions bring spice  to our language. Yet certain well-used phrases from science are just plain wrong! Some are obvious, yet we use them anyhow. For example, a person who acutely shakes her head and says \" A watched pot never boils\" while you are waiting second after tiring second for test results to arrive or job offers to come in knows that if she sat down and watched a pot containing water on a stove over high heat for long enough, the water will eventually boil. However, a few phrases have less obvious scientific inaccuracies. Here are a few for you to consider. Once in a blue moon: This poetic phrase refers to something that occurs extremely rarely. A blue moon is the term commonly used for a second full moon that occasionally appears in a single month of our solar-based calendars. The problem with the phrase, however, is that blue moons are not so rare. They happen every few years at least, and can even happen within months of each other when the 29.5-day lunar cycle puts the full moon at the beginning of any month but February. The usage of \"blue moon\" as the second full moon in a month dates back to a 1937 Marine Farmer's Almanac . But before that, blue moons meant something slightly different. Typically, 12 full moons occur from winter solstice to the next winter solstice, but occasionally a fourth full moon in a season could be observed . In such a case, one of the four full moons in that season was known as \"blue\" Where there's smoke, there's fire: The phrase means that if something looks wrong, it likely is wrong. But let's step back. Do you always have to have fire if you see smoke? Answering that first requires defining 'fire\" , Merriam--Webster's first definition of fire is \" the phenomenon of combustion manifested in light, flame and heat\". Combustion is the chemical reaction that occurs when fuel is burned in the presence of oxygen---denying a fire any of these three things will stop the fire; attempting to start a fire without any one of the three things will be impossible. In complete combustion---what occurs when you light a gas stove--- the fire produces no smoke. However, when most materials are burned, they have incomplete combustion, which means that the fire isn't able to completely burn all of the fuel . Smoke, then, can be considered to be a product of pyrolysis   rather than of fire itself. You're probably thinking---so what? To get the smoke, a fire needed to be present at some point, right? Not always. Diamonds are forever: Thanks to the DeBeers slogan , decorating your honey's neck, wrists and fingers with diamonds means true and timeless love. Of course, no object that you can hold in your hand can last forever. But diamonds have a special reason for being incapable of timelessness.

{"answer": 3, "choices": ["indifferent", "objective", "critical", "favourable"], "question": "Concepts from science and nature are filled with our language's common phrases , idioms and spoken expressions. The unbelieving expression \"Well, I'll be a monkey's uncle\" has its origin in bitter disbelief over Darwin's writings on evolution. These colourful expressions bring spice  to our language. Yet certain well-used phrases from science are just plain wrong! Some are obvious, yet we use them anyhow. For example, a person who acutely shakes her head and says \" A watched pot never boils\" while you are waiting second after tiring second for test results to arrive or job offers to come in knows that if she sat down and watched a pot containing water on a stove over high heat for long enough, the water will eventually boil. However, a few phrases have less obvious scientific inaccuracies. Here are a few for you to consider. Once in a blue moon: This poetic phrase refers to something that occurs extremely rarely. A blue moon is the term commonly used for a second full moon that occasionally appears in a single month of our solar-based calendars. The problem with the phrase, however, is that blue moons are not so rare. They happen every few years at least, and can even happen within months of each other when the 29.5-day lunar cycle puts the full moon at the beginning of any month but February. The usage of \"blue moon\" as the second full moon in a month dates back to a 1937 Marine Farmer's Almanac . But before that, blue moons meant something slightly different. Typically, 12 full moons occur from winter solstice to the next winter solstice, but occasionally a fourth full moon in a season could be observed . In such a case, one of the four full moons in that season was known as \"blue\" Where there's smoke, there's fire: The phrase means that if something looks wrong, it likely is wrong. But let's step back. Do you always have to have fire if you see smoke? Answering that first requires defining 'fire\" , Merriam--Webster's first definition of fire is \" the phenomenon of combustion manifested in light, flame and heat\". Combustion is the chemical reaction that occurs when fuel is burned in the presence of oxygen---denying a fire any of these three things will stop the fire; attempting to start a fire without any one of the three things will be impossible. In complete combustion---what occurs when you light a gas stove--- the fire produces no smoke. However, when most materials are burned, they have incomplete combustion, which means that the fire isn't able to completely burn all of the fuel . Smoke, then, can be considered to be a product of pyrolysis   rather than of fire itself. You're probably thinking---so what? To get the smoke, a fire needed to be present at some point, right? Not always. Diamonds are forever: Thanks to the DeBeers slogan , decorating your honey's neck, wrists and fingers with diamonds means true and timeless love. Of course, no object that you can hold in your hand can last forever. But diamonds have a special reason for being incapable of timelessness. Without the extreme pressures of the deep Earth where they formed, a diamond will slowly turn back into graphite , which is why the older a diamond is, the more inclusions it's likely to have.

In my enthusiasm and excitement, I talked quite louder than usual voice and in Spanish, my mother tongue. A few minutes into the call, an old lady sitting at the table beside mine got up, seemingly offended, and asked the restaurant staff to relocate   a table as far away as possible from this man who seemed to be impolite. I sank in my seat out of embarrassment. I ended the call soon afterwards and felt the urge to apologize.

However, there is nothing fixed about attitudes to dirt. In the early 16th century, people thought that dirt on the skin was a means to block out disease, as medical opinion had it that washing off dirt with hot water could open up the skin and let ills in. A particular danger was thought to lie in public baths. By 1538, the French king had closed the bath houses in his kingdom. So did the king of England in 1546. Thus began a long time when the rich and the poor in Europe lived with dirt in a friendly way. Henry IV, King of France, was famously dirty. Upon learning that a nobleman had taken a bath, the king ordered that, to avoid the attack of disease, the nobleman should not go out. Though the belief in the merit   of dirt was long-lived, dirt has no longer been regarded as a nice neighbor ever since the 18th century. Scientifically speaking, cleaning away dirt is good to health. Clean water supply and hand washing are practical means of preventing disease. Yet, it seems that standards of cleanliness have moved beyond science since World War II. Advertisements repeatedly sell the idea: clothes need to be whiter than white, cloths ever softer, surfaces to shine. Has the hate for dirt, however, gone too far? Attitudes to dirt still differ hugely nowadays. Many first-time parents nervously try to warn their children off touching dirt, which might be responsible for the spread of disease.

But the puffins may be in danger. Last summer, the percentage of laid eggs that successfully produced baby puffins took a dive. Scientists also found a decline in the average body weight of the adult and baby puffins on Machias Seal Island, home to the area's largest colony. Over the winter, dozens of the seabirds from the region were found dead, likely from starvation. What's causing the puffin trouble? Scientists think it may be a shortage of food. With ocean temperatures rising, fish populations have moved around. Normally, puffins' primary food source is herring, a type of fish. A lack of herring in the area could be causing the problem. Butterfish from the south have become more abundant in the Gulf of Maine and could be a new food source for birds. But Steve Kress says butterfish may be too big and round for baby puffins to swallow. Puffins spend most of their lives at sea. They come ashore to breed each spring and return to the ocean in August. The chicks swim to sea about 40 days after hatching. Puffin populations stretch across the North Atlantic, from Maine to northern Russia. Maine's puffin population has been at risk in the past. In the 1800s, they were hunted for their food, eggs and feathers. By 1901, only one pair of puffins remained in the state.

And the amount of time they spend on these devices is only likely to increase in the future. But are all these changes good? We sometimes call children who are able to use mobile devices and technology easily digital natives. They can text, email, get Wi-Fi, and download. Some experts say that long periods of time spent chatting to friends online, playing video games and listening to mp3s, for example, may possibly change how their brains work. Then there is the question of privacy. All this online activity creates a digital footprint. Every time we share a photo or a post on social media, and every time we search for something on the Internet, information about our activity is stored somewhere. Our inability to control what happens to our children's digital footprint and their personal privacy has big possibilities. It might become normal for companies to ask their employees for their social media qualifications. We are also becoming more aware that companies and governments may be able to 'listen in' on our communications. So it is important to make our children aware of the possible results of over sharing. Another area where the digital world may have a big effect is in education.

{"answer": 3, "choices": ["if exercise cushions against depression", "what can lead to depression in animals and people", "if stress can contribute to the development of depression", "how exercise contributes to reducing someone's risk for depression"], "question": "Exercise may help to safeguard the mind against depression  through previously unknown effects on working muscles, according to a new study involving mice. Mental health experts have long been aware that even mild, repeated stress can contribute to the development of depression and other mood disorders in animals and people. Scientists have also known that exercise seems to cushion against depression. But precisely how exercise, a physical activity can reduce someone's risk for depression, a mood state, has been mysterious. So for the new study, researchers at the Karolinska Institute in Stockholm studied the brains and behavior of mice in a complicated and novel fashion. We can't ask mice if they are feeling cheerful or in low spirits. Instead, researchers have pictured certain behaviors that indicate depression in mice. If animals lose weight, stop seeking out a sugar solution when it's available -- because, probably, they no longer experience normal pleasures -- or give up trying to escape from the cold-water zone just freeze in place, they are categorized as depressed. And in the new experiment, after five weeks of frequent but low-level stress, such as being lightly shocked, mice displayed exactly those behaviors. They became depressed. The scientists could then have tested whether exercise blunts   the risk of developing depression after stress by having mice run first. But, frankly, from earlier research, they wanted to know how, so they bred pre-exercised mice. A wealth of earlier research by these scientists and others had shown that aerobic exercise, in both mice and people, increases the production within muscles of an enzyme   called PGC-1alpha.

But precisely how exercise, a physical activity can reduce someone's risk for depression, a mood state, has been mysterious. So for the new study, researchers at the Karolinska Institute in Stockholm studied the brains and behavior of mice in a complicated and novel fashion. We can't ask mice if they are feeling cheerful or in low spirits. Instead, researchers have pictured certain behaviors that indicate depression in mice. If animals lose weight, stop seeking out a sugar solution when it's available -- because, probably, they no longer experience normal pleasures -- or give up trying to escape from the cold-water zone just freeze in place, they are categorized as depressed.

{"answer": 2, "choices": ["The Dead Sea is a miracle of the world.", "How to save the environment of the Dead Sea.", "The Dead Sea is slowly becoming smaller.", "Why the Dead Sea is so salty."], "question": "As a little boy I read a book with a picture showing a man reading while floating in the Dead Sea. What a miracle! How would it feel to lie back in water so thick with salt that it was impossible to sink?               Fed by the Jordan River and smaller streams, the Dead Sea is the lowest point on the earth's surface, and its water is ten times saltier than the Mediterranean. As evaporation  is its only outlet, salt and other minerals become super-concentrated. Earlier this year, I drove down the long, steep hill to realize my dream. The shoreline was a broad area of bare salt-mud, but the water edge was out of sight. It seemed as if somebody had pulled the Dead Sea's plug . Eli Dior, an Israeli official, explained the problem \"The Dead Sea is drying up. Every year, the surface falls about one meter, and as the water level falls, shallow areas are left high and dry.\" Over the last half-century, the five neighboring countries have used up almost all the water flowing into the Dead Sea to meet human and agriculture needs. Result the Dead Sea is being emptied.               With population in the neighbouring countries to double at least in the next 50 years, there is little hope of restoring the water being used in this area.

Cards, flowers, sales, TV specials, and a day off for someone who really deserves it --those are what probably come to mind for many people when they think of Mother's Day. But there's more about the story. The earliest Mother's Day celebrations were held during spring in Ancient Greece. The celebrations honored Rhea, the Mother of the gods. During the 1600s, England celebrated a day called Mothering Sunday. On this day even servants   were given the day off to spend with their families. A mothering cake was even served with the family meal. In the U.S., Mother's Day began in 1872 when Julia Ward Howe, who wrote the words of the famous song The Battle Hymn of the Republic, suggested it as a day devoted to peace. But it didn't really become popular until 1907 when Anna Jarvis started a campaign   to honor her own mother. She believed that mothers could help people get over the pain they experienced during the Civil War. The U.S. isn't alone in devoting a day to its mothers.

I hesitantly asked, \"Do you think I could get a job at the packing shed?\" \"Sure. My cousin is the boss. He'll give you a job.\" Mama  came  into  the  kitchen  and  exchanged  greetings with Chatita. She must have heard our conversation. \"I  think  it's  nice  that  you're  going  to  go  to  college, Chatita.

Clarence Duncan has been teaching in Brownsville since last year and I think Zulema will start this year.\" The lightbulb blinked again and went out. Mama quickly arose from the table. \"I'm going to have to bring in the lanterns. I knew I shouldn't have packed them away.\" \"Well, Nilda, do you want to go? Because, if you do, you can go over to Edinburg with me tomorrow.\" I hesitated, then said, \"Yes. I want to go.\" My heart was beating fast. I couldn't believe how happy I was feeling. \"But I have to talk to Mama and Papa. What if they won't let me?\" \"You can at least go with me tomorrow and find out what it's all about.

My parents had never had the opportunity for much education. Juana had quit school  to get married and Roberto and Zeke had graduated from high school as I had. But college? I would be the first one in my family to go to college. Yes, college was exactly what I wanted. The day had  turned dark and  the  rain had started. My mother  came back  into  the kitchen with two lanterns. \"Mama, I need to ask you something.\" She picked up a cloth and began to clean the dust from the lanterns. She looked at me and smiled. \"Mama,  if  I  could  find  a way  to pay,  could  I  take  classes  at  the  junior  college?\"  I  asked, trying to control my excitement. She stopped cleaning and raised her eyebrows. \"What would you study, my daughter?\" \"I think I want to be a teacher,\" I quietly replied. Mama sat down at the table across from me. \"Then, I would like for you to go to college,\" she said in a serious tone. \"What about Papa? Do you think he will allow me to go?\" \"Your  father wants  you  to  be  happy.  If  going  to  college  and  being  a  teacher makes  you happy, then he will probably allow it,\" she answered. I didn't say anything. I was enjoying the feeling of happiness and sense of wonder that had come over me. The two of us sat in the darkened room without speaking until  I saw my mama rubbing her eyes with the edge of her apron. \"What's wrong, Mama.\" \"Nothing,\" she replied. \"I probably got some dust in my eyes.

The things I do all the time are playing football, watching movies and going places with my friends. I know it sounds bad, but what I find funny is when people hurt themselves.

On China's biggest online search engine Baidu, it has been looked up almost 600,000 times.

The word resurfaced again recently after Chan posted it on his Weibo page. Thousands of users then began to flood Chan's Weibo page with comments, coining the word in reference to his infamous shampoo appearance. The word appears to have many different meanings, and there's no perfect translation, but you could use it as an adjective to give emphasis to the word that follows it. A kitten might be \"duang cute\", for example. Or you might be \"very duang confused\" by this blog.

There is one located on our street and it has just been completely rebuilt. I told her that they helped people book their trips and vacations. \"Why haven't we ever been in there?\" she wanted to know. \"Because we do everything ourselves online these days\" I explained. \"But why do it yourself if other people want to do it for you?\" she wondered out loud. The answer is that the travel agency makes a little bit of money on each ticket you book through them. If you book your ticket yourself, online, you save that money. Saving money sounds great except that when you think about it you typically spend three evenings comparing prices to end up saving $30 on a $300 trip. All those $30 discounts add up of course so I guess we should be happy with that. Still, how bad is it really to pay someone $30 and trust them to buy you something decent? Wouldn't you say your free evenings are worth more than $10 a piece? Consider books for a moment. Buying your book at Amazon saves you maybe 30% to 40% on each book. Add to that the convenience of shopping from home and getting the package delivered to your home address. So far so good. Unfortunately that does mean you spend way too much time browsing Amazon. com while you could do something fun instead. Like maybe reading an actual book? Then the package arrives and you aren't home and end up having to pick it up at the local post- office. All in all I wonder how much time I end up investing in the whole process. Time sounds free, but to most of us, it is more valuable than money. The Internet Economy promised to get rid of the middle-men and we loved it. Somehow, I'm starting to get the feeling that we ourselves ended up doing the work of that middle-men we were so eager to get rid of. In any project you can always pick two of these: fast, cheap or good. We seem to have focused a lot on 'cheap' and 'good' but the extra time we need to invest to keep it 'fast' comes out of our own pockets.

Researchers from the University of Montreal wanted to see if blind people were also better at locating sounds that are far away. Twenty-three blind people participated in the study.

He had chosen to study this major because he could get a good job with it.     He won the Nobel Prize for Chemistry in 1954 \"for his research into the nature of the chemical bond and its application to the explanation of the structure of complex substances\". His interest in the \"behavior\" of molecules   led him from physical chemistry to biological chemistry, especially of the human body. He began with proteins and their main parts, the amino acids  , which are called the \"building blocks of life\". In 1950, he constructed the first satisfactory model of a protein molecule, a discovery very important to the understanding of the living cell.      During World War II, Pauling was a member of the Research Board for National Security, for which he was awarded the Presidential Medal of Merit in 1948.

Even walking through heavy, wet snow can a person's heart. Many people aren't conditioned to the physical stress of outdoor activities and don't know the dangers of being outdoors in cold weather. Those who like winter sports can suffer accidental hypothermia if they don't make certain preparations. Hypothermia means the body temperature has fallen below normal. It occurs when your body can't produce enough energy to keep the internal   body temperature warm enough. It can kill you. Heart failure causes most deaths in hypothermia. Children, the elderly and those with heart disease are at special risk. As people age, their ability to keep a normal internal body temperature often decreases. Elderly people can suffer hypothermia without knowing they're in danger because they can't notice the cold conditions as quickly as the young. Besides cold temperatures, high winds, snow and rain can also steal body heat. Wind is especially dangerous because it removes the layer of heated air from around your body. At 30 degrees Fahrenheit in a 20-mile-per-hour wind, the cooling effect is equal to calm air at four degrees. Similarly dampness   causes the body to lose heat faster than it would at the same temperature in drier conditions. To keep warm, wear more clothes. This traps air between layers. Also, wear a hat or head scarf. Much of your body's heat can be lost through your head. Keep your hands and feet warm, too, as they tend to lose heat rapidly. Don't drink alcohol before going outdoors or when outside. Alcohol makes you feel warm at first because blood vessels in the skin expand. But heat is then drawn away from the body's important organs.

A real set of braces in Bangkok, the capital city of Thailand, for example, will cost around $ 1,200, which is a large amount for the country with a GDP of $345 billion ( a billion is 1,000 million), compared to the US which had a GDP of $1,506 Trillion ( a Trillion is 1,000 billion) last year. While Asian teens may think that their colorful fake braces are cool, experts say that these trendy fashion braces can cause illness and can even lead to death. According to the New York Daily News, fake fashion braces have already been linked to the deaths of two teens in Thailand.A 17-year-old in the northeast city of Khon Kaen died from heart failure caused by a thyroid infection  from a pair of fake fashion braces. Police also linked the death of another 14-year-old girl in Chonburi to a pair of fashion braces she had brought from an illegal shop.

Love is a signal that both partners are committed, and makes it more likely that this commitment will continue as long as necessary for children to reach independence. But what does science have to say about the notion of love at first sight? In recent years the ability to watch the brain in action has offered a wealth of insight into the mechanics of love. Researchers have shown that when a person falls in love, a dozen different part of brain work together to release chemicals that trigger feelings of euphoria, bonding and excitement. It has also been shown that the unconditional love between a mother and a child is associated with activity in different regions of the brain from those associated with pair-bonding love. Passionate love is rooted in the reward circuitry of the brain--the same area that is active when humans feel a rush from cocaine. In fact, the desire, motivations and withdrawals involved in love have a great deal in common with addiction.

Comics are now gaining a new respectability at school. That is thanks to an increasingly popular and creative program, often aimed at struggling readers, that encourages children to plot, write and draw comic books, in many cases using themes from their own lives. The Comic Book Project was started in 2001 by Michael Bitz at an elementary school in Queens. Since its creation, the program, which is mainly conducted after school, has spread to more than 850 schools across the country. It has gotten a big push from the craze   among teenagers for comic book clubs and for Manga, a wildly popular variety of comic from Japan. The point is not to drop a comic book on a child's desk and say \"read this\". Rather, the workshops give groups of students the opportunity to work together on stories and characters that they then revise, publish and share with others in their communities. Teachers are finding it easier to teach writing and grammar with material that students are fully invested in . And it turns out that comic books have other built-in advantages. The pairing of visual and written plotlines  that they rely on appear to be especially helpful to struggling readers. No one is suggesting that comic books should take the place of traditional books or for standard reading and composition lessons. Teachers who would once have dismissed comics out of hand are learning to use a style that clearly has a powerful hold on young minds. They are using what works.

However, a healthy diet can reduce your risk of developing the disease by 40 to 60 percent. Generally speaking, eating more vegetables can reduce your risk of developing breast cancer by 60 percent. Vegetables like cabbage are rich in fiber  , can lower your risk of developing breast cancer. To get the most from their goodness, it's recommended that you eat at least three to four cups of these vegetables per week. It's the oleic acid   contained in olive oil. American scientists conducting laboratory research have observed that oleic acid has a beneficial effect on breast cancer cells. Olive oil is the richest source of this acid, so whenever possible, use it in place of butter. Eating fruit is another excellent way to help prevent the development of breast cancer. In fact, women who do eat fruit are six percent less likely to develop the disease. The American Institute for Cancer Research considers berries   (blueberries, strawberries, etc.) to be powerful for breast cancer fighters. It's the lycopene  , found in great quantities in tomatoes, that can reduce the risk of developing breast cancer. The lycopene found in canned tomatoes is more readily absorbed by the body than that contained in fresh ones, so add tomato juice, paste, and sauce to your diet. As a result of various studies, the American Institute for Cancer Research has concluded that components   found in green tea can help halt the development of cancerous tumours   and even prevent them from appearing in the first place. Three cups a day will help you get the benefits of green tea. According to the passage, the author may agree that   _  .", "subject": ""}

A nameless cat with a taste for travel flew for three weeks between New York and Tel Aviv in 1984. It escaped from its owner's cat-box in the plane's luggage compartment on the first trip and all efforts to get it out with bowls of milk and food failed. After nearly 80,000 miles of flying the airline called in a vet who got it out. The Chinese attitude to the cat was not clear. Cats were welcome for their ability to kill mice and were considered suitable pets for women. On the other hand, they were suspected of bring bad luck into the home. In the days before the invention of the watch, it was said that they used their cats as clocks. The pupils of the cat's eyes were believed to gradually change shape with the position of the sun in the sky. At midday they were a narrow line and they gradually  became rounder until sunset.

Researchers from Pennsylvania State University and Duke University tracked more than 700 children from across the US between kindergarten and age 25 and found a significant correlation between their social skills as kindergartners and their success as adults two decades later. In 1991, teachers assessed how the kindergartners interacted  with each other socially using a range of criteria like whether they cooperate with their peers without prompting , if they're helpful to others, whether they're good at understanding feelings, and if they can solve problems on their own. Researchers then kept track of whether the students went on to graduate high school on time, get a college degree, and find and keep a full-time job by 25. They also monitored the participants' involvement with crime, drug abuse, public assistance, and mental health issues. The results showed that socially competent children were far more likely to earn a college degree and have a full-time job by 25 than those with limited social skills.

However, scholars have been working to established some facts and this is the brief story of Aesop as it is accepted today. Aesop was born a slave around the year 620 B.C. InAncient Greece, it was a privilege and tradition of freedmen to be interested in public affairs, so Aesop worked hard to raise himself from a servile slave's position to a high position of renown. He was a thinker and philosopher and eventually became widely admired. Aesop was a smart man and a good speaker. He liked to learn and to also teach people, so he traveled through many countries. He came to Sardis, the capital of the famous king Croesus of Lydia who was a patron of learning and learned men.  Croesus was so impressed by Aesop that he invited Aesop to permanently reside at Sardis. The king hired Aesop to do diplomatic government work such as trying to establish peace between the various republics of Greece. Aesop reconciled the inhabitants of these cities by telling his wise fables.  It was on one of these ambassadorial missions that Aesop was killed. Croesus had sent him to Delphi with lots of gold which was to be distributed among the citizens. After talking with the people of Delphi, Aesop got so mad at the citizens because of their covetousness. He refused to divide the money and instead sent it back to his master. The Delphians were so mad they executed Aesop as a public criminal.  As it often happens in Greek history, the Delphians were visited by a series of calamities as a sort of retribution for Aesop's death. This is where the phrase \"the blood of Aesop\" originated.

{"answer": 3, "choices": ["Tropical wave.", "Tropical storm.", "Category 1 hurricane.", "Category 2 hurricane."], "question": "Hurricane Sandy was a hurricane that destroyed parts of the Caribbean and the Mid-Atlantic and Northeastern United States during late October 2012, with minor impacts in the Southeastern and Midwestern states and Eastern Canada. Sandy, classified as the eighteenth named storm and tenth hurricane of the 2012 Atlantic hurricane season, was a Category 2 storm at its peak intensity. While it was a Category 1 storm off the coast of the Northeastern United States, the storm became the largest Atlantic hurricane on record. Previous estimates of losses due to damage and business interruption are estimated at $65.6 billion, which would make it the second-costliest Atlantic hurricane, behind only Hurricane Katrina. At least 253 people were killed along the path of the storm in eight countries. Sandy developed from a tropical wave in the western Caribbean Sea on October 22, quickly strengthened, and was upgraded to Tropical Storm six hours later. Sandy moved slowly northward toward the Greater Antilles and gradually becoming stronger. On October 24, Sandy became a hurricane, made landfall near Kingston, Jamaica, a few hours later, entered into the Caribbean Sea again and strengthened into a Category 2 hurricane. On October 25, Sandy hit Cuba, and then weakened to a Category 1 hurricane. Early on October 26, Sandy moved through the Bahamas. On October 27, Sandy briefly weakened to a tropical storm and then restrengthened to a Category 1 hurricane. Early on October 29, Sandy turned from north to northwest and then moved ashore near Atlantic City, New Jersey, as a post-tropical cyclone with hurricane-force winds. In the United States, Hurricane Sandy affected 24 states, including the entire eastern seaboard from Florida to Maine and west across the Appalachian Mountains to Michigan and Wisconsin, with particularly severe damage in New Jersey and New York.

When blood vessels open up more, blood flows more smoothly and is less likely to form the clots   that cause heart attacks and strokes. \"We are not saying to stop your statins or not to exercise but rather to add this to an overall program of heart health,\" said Miller, who presented his findings to a meeting of the American Heart Association in New Orleans. Miller's team tested 10 healthy, non-smoking men and women, who were told to bring their favorite music. They spent half an hour listening to the recordings and half an hour listening to music they said made them feel anxious while the researchers did ultrasound tests designed to show blood vessel function. Compared to their normal baseline measurements, blood vessel diameter increased 26 percent on average when the volunteers heard their joyful music.

I'm too skinny. I'd be happy if I were taller, shorter, had curly hair, straight hair, a smaller nose, bigger muscles, longer legs. Do any of these statements sound familiar? Do you often put yourself down? If so, you're not alone. As a teen, you're going through a ton of changes in your body. And as your body changes, so does your image   of yourself. Lots of people have trouble getting used to it and this can affect their confidence. Some people think they need to change how they look or act to feel good about themselves. But actually all you need to do is change the way you see your body and how you think about yourself. The first thing to do is recognize that your body is your own, no matter what shape, size, or color it comes in. If you're very worried about your weight or size, go to your doctor to check that things are OK. But it's no one's business but your own what your body is like-finally, you have to be happy with yourself.Next, find which aspects of your appearance you can change and which you can't change and need to accept-like their height, for example, or their shoe size. If there are things about yourself that you want to change and can do this by making goals for yourself. For example, if you want to get fit, make a pan to exercise every day and eat nutritious foods. When you hear negative comments coming from within yourself, tell yourself to stop. Try building your confidence by listing three things in your day that really gave you pleasure.

I'm too skinny. I'd be happy if I were taller, shorter, had curly hair, straight hair, a smaller nose, bigger muscles, longer legs. Do any of these statements sound familiar? Do you often put yourself down? If so, you're not alone. As a teen, you're going through a ton of changes in your body. And as your body changes, so does your image   of yourself. Lots of people have trouble getting used to it and this can affect their confidence. Some people think they need to change how they look or act to feel good about themselves. But actually all you need to do is change the way you see your body and how you think about yourself. The first thing to do is recognize that your body is your own, no matter what shape, size, or color it comes in. If you're very worried about your weight or size, go to your doctor to check that things are OK. But it's no one's business but your own what your body is like-finally, you have to be happy with yourself.Next, find which aspects of your appearance you can change and which you can't change and need to accept-like their height, for example, or their shoe size. If there are things about yourself that you want to change and can do this by making goals for yourself. For example, if you want to get fit, make a pan to exercise every day and eat nutritious foods. When you hear negative comments coming from within yourself, tell yourself to stop. Try building your confidence by listing three things in your day that really gave you pleasure.

Looking behind her into the darkness, at first she thought that Jessie was the wolf. But a metre behind the boy was a 350kg polar bear -- no wolf in sight -- standing on the icy road. Jessie turned and saw it, too, then ran, screaming, to his mother. Angiyou felt a rush of blood to her brain. \"Get as far away as you can!\" she shouted to the boys as she ran towards the bear. She stopped just in front of it, then faced it quietly. It made a move to go around her to get to the boys, who must have seemed like the easier meal. But Angiyou moved with the bear to maintain her position blocking the children. Finally she got the animal's attention. In response, it rose on its hind legs, stretching to its full 2.5m height.

Researchers from Britain's University of Warwick Business School, University College London, and Dartmouth College, US, did a number of experiments. The research team used computer software to make 40 faces, from the least to the most trustworthy-looking. The study said that the difference between a trustworthy face and one that isn't as trustworthy comes from features that look slightly angry or slightly happy, even when the face is at rest. However, a slightly happy face is more likely to be trusted. Researchers gave participants some money and asked them which face they trusted to invest the money for them. Then researchers gave some good and bad information about the people with these faces, and asked the participants again whom they trusted. The results showed that even if they got different information, the participants didn't change their choices. They were still more likely to invest their money with the more trustworthy-looking faces.

Researchers from Britain's University of Warwick Business School, University College London, and Dartmouth College, US, did a number of experiments. The research team used computer software to make 40 faces, from the least to the most trustworthy-looking. The study said that the difference between a trustworthy face and one that isn't as trustworthy comes from features that look slightly angry or slightly happy, even when the face is at rest. However, a slightly happy face is more likely to be trusted. Researchers gave participants some money and asked them which face they trusted to invest the money for them. Then researchers gave some good and bad information about the people with these faces, and asked the participants again whom they trusted. The results showed that even if they got different information, the participants didn't change their choices. They were still more likely to invest their money with the more trustworthy-looking faces. Chris Olivola, one of the study's authors, said in the University of Warwick's press release: \"It seems we are still willing to go with our own instincts   about whether we think someone looks like we can trust them. The temptation   to judge strangers by their faces is hard to resist.\" Which of the following about the experiment is TRUE?", "subject": ""}

Each of these options has a different opportunity cost--namely, what they cost us in missed opportunities.

Consider that most famous economic rule of all: there's no such thing as a free lunch.

Not only is it deadly poisonous --- though that doesn't stop people trying to eat it --- but it is also able to scare off enemies by inflating itself to become much larger than normal, when it is young it even chews on its own brothers and sisters. Tiger puffer fish attach their eggs to rocks near the bottom of the sea, often at the mouths of bays. Then the larvae   move to the entries of rivers and lakes once they have grown a little. Then, having put on a lot of weight, they head out to sea. There's no innocent childhood for the puffer fish, as Shin Oikawa of Kyushu University in Japan and his colleagues found out when they put the larvae of tiger puffer fish in the lab and monitored them for two months. They found that the larvae went through three steps in which their metabolic  rates increased dramatically when they reached body weights of 0.002g, 0.01g, and 0.1g. When a larva went through one of these steps, its behavior also changed. For instance, once a larva had passed the first level it would have grown its first tooth and could start attacking larvae that had not yet reached that stage. Similarly, any larva that had reached the 0.01g or 0.1g levels would start attacking lighter larvae. The researchers noted that the baby fish had a \"relatively small mouth\", so rather than swallowing their brothers and sisters whole, they would bite pieces out of them. Despite this limitation, the fish caused plenty of deaths --- up to 12 per cent of the deaths that happened in the lab each day. Those fish that grew fast enough to be able to chew on their fellows had an advantage. The extra food accelerated their growth and development. Tiger puffer fish are likely to be faster and swifter, so they can deal better with enemies. As the name suggests, puffer fish can inflate to make themselves seem much larger than they really are, thus scaring off enemies. They do this by filling their stomachs, which are extremely elastic , with water. If that's not enough of a threat, the tiger puffer fish --- like most of the other puffer fish in the family --- carries a deadly toxin . Eat one puffer fish and the poison will paralyze   your muscles, including the muscles responsible for breathing, so death is usually caused by a lack of oxygen. Famously, the fish is a delicacy in Japan, where highly qualified chefs produce dishes that contain the safe level of the poison.

I'm only 29, so it's been a quick ride to CEO.Out of college, I worked for AOL as a product manager, then moved to Revolution Health and ran the consumer product team.In mid-2007 I left Revolution Health and started LivingSocial with several other colleagues, where I became a CEO.     Career advice: Don't figure out where you want to work, or even what industry you'd like to work at.Figure out what makes you do so.What gives you a really big rush? Answer why you like things, not what you like doing...and then apply it to your work life.Also, just because you're graduating, don't stop learning.Read more books than you did in college.If you do, and they're not, you're really well-positioned to succeed in whatever you do.

{"answer": 1, "choices": ["he received a warm welcome", "his literary road was not easy", "he became famous for his unusual style", "his poetic style was copied by other poets"], "question": "Walt Whitman was born in 1819 in Long Island, New York. Whitman received most of his education outside of the classroom. At the age of eleven, he worked in a law office as an office boy where he became interested in reading. He was soon reading the works of famous authors like William Shakespeare and Homer, and was well on his way to becoming one of America's most well-known poets. By the time Whitman was seventeen years old, he had already worked as a printer's learner, a worker, and a learning games to help his students with spelling and maths. In his early twenties, however, he gave up teaching to pursue   a full-time career as a journalist and poet. When Walt Whitman first appeared as a poet, his arrival onto the American literary scene was met with controversy. His first collection of poems, Leaves of Grass, was so unusual that no commercial publisher would print the work. In 1855 Whitman published, at his own expense, the first edition of his collection of twelve poems. Whitman's poetic style was uncommon I the sense that he wrote poems in a form called parallelism  , in which his goal was to copy the flow of the sea and the quickly-passing nature of human emotion. A common theme in Whitman's poetry is self-realization. In his work, Whitman moves from conventional patterns of rhyme to create a unique rhythm and a multi-layered, but truly American voice. \"Although Whitman was considered a revolutionary by many, there is little doubt he loved his country deeply.\" In his writing, he used slang   and various images, or voices, to create a sense of national unity.

They spend days building tall towers out of vines and logs . Then they jump off _  According to their beliefs, the first land diver was a woman. She decided to run away from her rude husband. So she climbed up a tall tree and tied some vines around her feet. Her husband also climbed up the tree and tried to catch her, but the woman jumped and the man followed. The vines saved her life, but her husband died. This ancient custom caught the interest of some students at Oxford University in England. In the late 1970s, they formed a group called the Dangerous Sports Club. They were some of the first people to test several of what are now called extreme sports. They are said to have invented modern bungee jumping. In the spring of 1979, members of the group jumped off the Clifton Suspension Bridge in Bristol, England. They were attached to the bridge by a bungee cord, a long elastic rope that stretches. The group soon received even more attention when they organized a bungee jump off the Golden Gate Bridge in San Francisco, California. A man named A. J. Hackett of New Zealand decided to make the sport into a business. He started developing bungee ropes and material with a friend. They held a major jump in 1987 off the famous Eiffel Tower in Paris, France. They later got permission to open the first bungee jumping operation on the Kawarau Bridge in Queenstown, New Zealand.

When I knocked on the door, I met in an instant an angry look and a few harsh words. When the door was slammed in my face, I stood there shocked, and in a rush, I was reminded of my dog bit my father 20 years ago or so. What brought that story back was that same feeling of betrayal. Both stories taught me something the next day. You see, when I got up in the morning and was told my dog had died, it became clear to me that he must have been in great pain. For him to have bitten a family member, he could not have been himself. Much the same for the other story when I learned that my friend's wife had just left him.

The real community of Celebration, Florida, built in 1999, applies the social and environmental goals of both Disney and the New Urbanism movement. Disney and the New Urbanism have imagined communities that promote social and local communication. Celebration has a central Market Street district to reduce traffic and encourage social contacts. The idea is that if the downtown area is neatly and closely ranked, people will walk and meet their neighbors. Downtown events like arts festivals also bring citizens together. Narrow, tree-lined streets are \"traffic calm\"----with slower speed limits----to encourage bicycling and walking.    Moreover, housing in Celebration includes both single- and multi-family houses that encourages socialization. Apartment buildings are located close to downtown, and houses are built close together with small yards. They feature entrance halls to encourage citizens to socialize.    \"Many aspects of that kind of design are really aimed at maximizing social communication between citizens, not just on the streets but also in community institutions that are very much a part of public life there,\" says Andrew Ross, a New York University professor who lived in Celebration for one year.    Utopian communities such as Celebration are also designed with environmental protection in mind. The town itself is built on 4,900 acres surrounded by a 4,700 acre protected greenbelt. The greenbelt parks, and common areas accommodate native wildlife and animals.    High-rise office and apartment buildings provide close office and living space in a small geographic area in order to reduce urban  _ , the spread of today's cities onto nature areas. Buildings also minimize environmental influence by using cooling; and electric systems with insulated (;) glass, cooling towers, and energy-saving lamps.    \"The town more or less borrows very heavily from New Urbanist principles...to create environmentally friendly alternatives to sprawl and to create communities around people rather than vehicles,\" Ross said.

He sailed south of New Zealand, through the South Pacific, around South America, north on the Atlantic, back south past Africa, through the Indian Ocean and back to Melbourne. Even as a young child, Jesse had been an adventurer who traveled all over Europe and Asia with his parents. Born in Munich, Germany in 1981, he moved to Australia with his family when he was only two years old. They moved close to a rainforest in Cow Bay, about 3500kms north of Melbourne, where they built a small house with no electricity or running water. Jesse grew up at the beach enjoying the outdoors to its fullest. At 14, he sailed for the first time with his father and brother, Beau. It was after this trip that he began to dream about sailing around the world. Jesse's family played an important role. \"I was made to believe I could do anything.\" he says. Although, he says, there were others that were not so encouraging or supportive, \"People that I looked up to, respected and trusted told me I couldn't. Thankfully, I trusted myself. There were people that said that the boat couldn't be ready by the time I had to leave.\" However, through perseverance and belief in himself he was able to do what many told him was impossible.

He sailed south of New Zealand, through the South Pacific, around South America, north on the Atlantic, back south past Africa, through the Indian Ocean and back to Melbourne. Even as a young child, Jesse had been an adventurer who traveled all over Europe and Asia with his parents. Born in Munich, Germany in 1981, he moved to Australia with his family when he was only two years old. They moved close to a rainforest in Cow Bay, about 3500kms north of Melbourne, where they built a small house with no electricity or running water. Jesse grew up at the beach enjoying the outdoors to its fullest. At 14, he sailed for the first time with his father and brother, Beau. It was after this trip that he began to dream about sailing around the world. Jesse's family played an important role. \"I was made to believe I could do anything.\" he says. Although, he says, there were others that were not so encouraging or supportive, \"People that I looked up to, respected and trusted told me I couldn't. Thankfully, I trusted myself.

The new model could work in Meyer's restaurants because he draws a particular type of customers who are there for a high-end experience.

Sleep is necessary for the body to rest, yet our brains continue to process information.

Joseph Kett teaches history at the University of Virginia in Charlottesville. He says living at home until the late ten years has become the norm   only in recent times. \"In the 17th century, children were often sent to live in other people's home when they were about 10 or 11\", he said. Peter Sheras teaches education at the University of Virginia. He says parents should listen when a child wants to move out. They should try to find out why the child wants some time away.

{"answer": 0, "choices": ["can record images", "can imagine objects", "provide centered images", "work at the same height"], "question": "Have you wondered why you have two eyes and why they are set close together on the front of your face? The reasons are simple and important to the way you see the rest of your world. Your eyes are like two small cameras. A camera catches an image of an object and records it on film.Similarly,when you look at something,each eye takes in what it sees and sends this image to the back of the eyeball.Because your eyes are set close together,they view the world from about the same height but from slightly different angles. Working as a team, the eyes send the images to your brain, which puts them together into a single, centered image. Seeing in stereo means seeing with two eyes working together,which is called stereoscopic sight.This allows you to view the world in three dimensions,or 3-D.Seeing depth helps you to judge the distance between you and the objects you see and to adjust to the changing angle at which you see something as you move closer to or farther away from it.If images are coming from only one eye, however,only two of these dimensions-height and width-can be perceived.A world seen with one eye is thus two-dimensional,as in a photograph. Now consider why your two eyes are on the front of your face.Think of other animals with this same arrangement.They are all animals that hunt,like lions and wolves.Their eyes face directly in front of them.This provides a field of sight about 180 degrees wide,which is called binocular sight.On the other hand,animals that are hunted have eyes on the sides of the head,which provides nearly 360-degree field of sight.In order to stay alive,they need to see things coming from the sides and from behind.However,without stereoscopic sight,they have difficulty determining how far a danger is. With sight both stereoscopic and binocular,humans share with animal hunters the ability to  see from side to side and to accurately determine the distance.If you think it would be great to  have another type of sight,perhaps with hundreds of tiny eyes like many insects do,think again!

People have generally viewed personal growth as a result or product that can easily be identified   and measured. The worker who gets a rise, the student whose grades improve, the foreigner who learns a new language--all these are examples of people who have measurable results to show for their efforts. By contrast, the process of personal growth is much more difficult to determine, since it is a journey and not the specific signposts or landmarks along the way. The process is not the road itself, but rather the attitudes and feelings people have, their caution or courage, as they meet with new experiences and unexpected obstacles  . In this process, the journey never really ends; there are always new ways to experience the world, new ideas to try, new challenges to accept. In order to grow, to travel new roads, people need to have a willingness to take risks, to face the unknown, and to accept the possibility that they may \"fail\" at first. How we see ourselves as we try a new way of being is extremely important to our ability to grow. Do we notice ourselves as quick and curious? If so, then we tend to take more chances and to be more open to unfamiliar experiences. Do we think we're shy and indecisive? Then our sense of fear can cause us to hesitate, to move slowly, and we think we're slow to adapt to change or that we're not smart enough to deal with a new challenge.

This has been questioned a lot recently in America. According to a new survey released by the Pew Research Center, only 40 percent of Americans felt that colleges provided a good value for the cost. At the same time, 86 percent of college graduates still felt it was good for them. There are a number of reasons for such dissatisfaction with college. First, there are plenty of problems with higher education -- poor quality and out-of-control costs are two of the biggest. Second, it is true that college is not for everyone. Plenty of rewarding and important careers do not require college. And due to the slow economy, there may in fact be more graduates than the current job market needs. Besides, anti-college feelings are nothing new.

However, getting a college education is still a good idea. College graduates earn more, and are more likely to have a job in the first place.

Some scientists believe birds have abilities including communication and different kinds of memory. In some unusual cases, their abilities seem better than those of humans.      Irene Pepperberg, a birds expert, did research about a grey parrot named. Griffin. Ms. Pepperberg says Griffin can arrange objects in order of size. She says the talking bird also can combine words in the right order. For example, he will combine words when asking for a piece of food. The researcher says experts had thought that only humans and other mammals with large brains have the ability to combine objects and words. She believes that bird brains have the ability to understand that complex  tasks must be done in the correct order.      Some birds have other memory skills. For example, they collect and store thousands of seeds in autumn, and find them later in winter. Alan Kamil and Alan Bond of the University of Nebraska are studying the memories of birds called jays and nutcrackers. Their experiments show that these birds use natural objects to find the seeds they have stored.      It's said some birds can learn as many as 2,000 different songs. Songs may have developed as a way for birds to communicate with other birds.      According to Verner Bingman of Bowling Green State University in Ohio, birds must have a special guidance system in their brain. He says that understanding how a bird's brain operates may help us better understand how a human brain processes information.

{"answer": 2, "choices": ["Finance", "Science", "Advertisement", "Sport"], "question": "As we all know, children are our future, and it's up to us to arm them with the tools to succeed. Sadly, today's children are sometimes being armed with more dangerous tools like weapons, drugs and gangs in the USA. Once a relatively peaceful environment, many schoolyards of today are becoming unsafe for both students and teachers. Home schools are available to give you choices. Home schooling provides top-quality education, flexibility and freedom to create your own schedule. At Sunny Home School we believe the choice should be yours. Thanks to modern technology, home schooling information is becoming readily available across the nation. A recent study by the ITBS (Iowa Tests of Basic Skills) and TAP (Tests of Achievement and Proficiency) shows us that students of home schools do particularly well when compared with the nationwide average. In every subject at every grade level, students of home schooling scored obviously higher than those in public and private schools. If you're new to home schooling, you may be asking yourself, \"Will home schools really work for my children?\" Fact: A nationwide study using a random selection of 1,516 families found students of home schooling to be scoring, on average, at or above the 80thpercentile (80) in all areas, on standardized achievement test. (Note: The national average on standardized achievement test is the 50thpercentile.) Collectively, the staff at Sunny Home School brings 65 years of experience in home schooling curriculum. We've placed students in the top 2% of the nation in math and many are successfully moving on to college. One study found that of the home schooled students, 94% said home education prepared them to be independent persons. For more home schooling information, call us today toll free at (1800)542-8668.

In fact, there is a growing field of health care known as music therapy, which uses music to treat diseases. Even hospitals are beginning to use music therapy. This is not surprising, as music affects the body and mind in many powerful ways. Research has shown that quick music can make a person feel more alert, while slow music can produce a calm, deep thinking state. Also, research has found that music can change brainwave activity levels. This can help the brain to change speeds more easily on its own as needed, which means that music can bring lasting benefits to your state of mind, even after you've stopped listening. Breathing and heart rates can also be influenced by music. This can mean slower breathing, slower heart rate. This is why music and music therapy can help reduce the damaging effects of long-term stress, greatly promoting   not only relaxation, but health. Music can also be used to bring about a more positive state of mind by helping to keep worries away.

Check out some other Best Picture nominees to see if you missed any of last year's top Hollywood films. The Imitation Game This historical thriller is about British computer scientist, Alan Turing (Benedict Cumberbatch), the father of artificial intelligence. At the start of World War II, Turing was asked to join a select team of mathematical geniuses to decode  the system the Nazis used to send military messages. Besides the actual breaking of the code, Cumberbatch's portrayal of Turing's personality, a mixture of decency and shyness, is also a highlight of the movie. Birdman This dark comedy film is about how Riggan Thomson, a faded star once famous for his superhero roles, struggles to regain fame. American actor Michael Keaton, 63, who has a similar experience to Thomson's, plays the leading role. Selma A stellar cast  including talk show queen Oprah Winfrey may be one reason to see Selma. But that the film focuses on Martin Luther King Jr.'s struggle for civil rights also makes it worth viewing. Based on the 1965 Selma to Montgomery voting rights marches, the film is a chronicle  of King's (David Oyelowo) campaign for political rights for African-American people. The Theory of Everything We know English theoretical physicist Stephen Hawking for his significant scientific discoveries, especially his black hole theories. This biographical film reveals the scientist's (played by Eddie Redmayne) secret romantic relationship with Jane Hawking (Felicity Jones), whom he meets and falls in love with at Cambridge and who later becomes his first wife. Boyhood American Director Richard Linklater did an experiment in this film, using the same cast for 12 years to record a boy's growth.

But when an ant returning along the crowded route to the nest met with another ant just starting out, the returning ant pushed the newcomer onto the other path.

And the money he did earn was chicken feed -- very little. Sometimes Al even had to accept handouts,gifts from his family and friends. But do not get me wrong. My friend was not a deadbeat. He was not the kind of person who never paid the money he owed. He simply _ pennies. He was always very careful with the money he spent. In fact,he was often a cheapskate. He did not like to spend money. The worst times were when he was flat broke and had no money at all. One day,Al scraped together a few dollars for a lottery ticket. He thought he would never strike it rich or gain lots of money unexpectedly. But his combination of numbers was chosen and he won the lottery. He hit the jackpot. He won a great deal of money. Al was so excited. The first thing he did was buy a costly new ear. He splurged on the one thing that he normally would not buy. Then he started spending money on unnecessary things. He started to waste it. It was like he had money to burn. He had more money than he needed and it was burning a hole in his pocket so he spent it quickly. When we got together for a meal at a restaurant,Al paid every time. He would always foot the bill,and pick up the tab. He told me the money made him feel like a million dollars. He was very happy. But,Al spent too much money. Soon my friend was down and out again. He had no money left. He was back to being strapped for cash. He had spent his bottom dollar, his very last amount. He did not even build up a nest egg. He had not saved any of the money. I admit I do feel sorry for my friend. He had enough money to live like a king. Instead,he is back to living on a shoestring--a very low budget. Some might say he is penny wise and pound foolish. He is wise about small things,but not about important things.

The graceful Art Nouveau dragon-fly entrances are just the most noticeable on a Metro system which celebrated its 100thanniversary by spending 30 million francs (PS2.9million) on making its stations works of art. On my way home I pass Bonne Nouvelle station in the heart of Paris's cinema district. There, during the cinema festival this summer, special lighting effects dot the platforms and films are projected onto the large advertising boards. More than anything the metro is efficient. \"When I worked on line 4\", says a retired driver, \"we had exactly 30 minutes and 15 seconds to complete the journey. If it took any longer, they cut our pay.\" But there are problems. Many Metro stations have too many stairs, and changing lines at big interchanges  can be tiresome. Moscow Passengers carried per day: 9m Cost of ticket: 12p Length: 164 miles    Lines: 11   Stations: 162 The first underground passage for the Moscow Metropolitan started in 1932. Three years later the trains started running. They haven't stopped since-- every 90 seconds or two minutes during rush hour, every five minutes the rest of the time, from 6 a.m. till 1 a. m. There may be a crowd of people but there is seldom a wait. The trains take you through spacious and spotless stations. For tourists it's a major sightseeing attraction: from Russian Art Deco to neo-classical, the Metro stations are not to be missed. Tokyo Passengers carried per day: 7m Cost of ticket: 90p ~ PS1.68 Length: 177 miles    Lines: 12   Stations: 209 Trains do not just arrive on time in Tokyo. They stop right on the platform mark so that passengers can line up knowing exactly where the doors will open. Train driving is a respectful job for life, for which the applicants must pass a strict screening of health checks, interviews and written exams before they can put on the enviable uniform, cap and white gloves. However, overcrowding means it is far from perfect. At rush hours, some stations employ part-time platform staff to push in passengers. Carriages can be filled to 184% of capacity . The main reason for such conditions is that the Tokyo subway station system has only 15 miles of track for every 1 million people, compared to 36 on the London Underground. New lines are under construction, but at a cost of PS500,000 per meter of rail. Progress has been slow. Mexico City Passengers carried per day: 4.2m Cost of ticket: 11p flat fare Length: 99 miles    Lines: 11   Stations: 175 Fast, relatively safe, and very cheap, Mexico City's underground is an ideal place of order and efficiency compared to the disorders above. The Mexican capital's underground system is the biggest in the continent and one of the most subsidized   networks in the world. The first trains leave the station at 5 a.m. and the last after midnight as the crowd move from the outskirts of the 20 million-strong megacity  . Mexico City's Metro also attracts a sizeable group of passengers who are unwilling to spend hours in traffic jams.

Sometimes the best life lessons are found deep in the roots of where we came from. My father passed away years ago, but I always remember the lessons he taught me. Three of them particularly shape my perspective day after day.  The first one is that little things make big things happen. To the best of my memory, when I was young, we needed to build a new shed. Those were the days when stores like Home Depot and Lowes didn't exist. Brand-new timber   was expensive, so folks often reused the materials that others in the community didn't need. That summer, Dad and I used the boards from an old abandoned barn. We pulled them down one by one, drew the nails out and took off the tin and straightened it in order to reuse it. We got our supplies back to our yard and got to work. I don't know how much of a help I really was, but I chose to stay beside Dad the entire period, working along with him. The sun was hot that day, and sweat formed and ran down our faces. I stood there and handed him the nails one by one, which were hammered into that shed. Dad made me feel proud of my work. Even though I just handed him the nails, he repeatedly emphasized how we built the new shed \"together\". He taught me that when you're willing to do hard work, even in little things, big things come together. The second one is that we should honor our promises. As a young man, my father always carried a pocket-sized Bible in his chest pocket. Shortly before the invasion of Normandy in 1944, he prayed for God's protection and promised God that if he made it home, he would make sure his family attended church every Sunday. Well, he made it home and he kept that promise. I cannot remember a Sunday when Dad did not take my mother, my siblings and me to church -- even when we were away on vacation. I now have my Dad's pocket Bible. It is one of my most treasured possessions, and it serves as a constant reminder of my dad's service to his country. However, it also serves as a visual representation of my dad's firm determination to keep his promises. Today, I place great value on my family and my faith, undoubtedly because of my dad's example. This lesson of promise has been introduced into all areas of my life.  The third one is that listening is a way to acquire wisdom. My dad and I kept ourselves busy doing a lot of things together. During the nights of late summer, after dinner, the whole family would gather on our small porch to talk as the sun went down. Sometimes an aunt or uncle would drop by, and at other times my grandparents would be there. They would talk about the neighborhood news, the goings-on in modern Western society and politics -- mostly ordinary things, but it was good to sit there listening and to be together. Moreover, sitting there on the porch as dusk faded into night, I learned the value of listening and observing. Sometimes taking a moment to pause gives us the best perspective and sometimes we find the best answers simply by listening. Life in America becomes more complex. However, I like to think back to the simple lessons I learned from my father. They were the building blocks of my character and the values that still guide me today. Perhaps someone who has influence on your life taught you life lessons that helped form your character. I'm convinced that our nation could gain a lot by applying these lessons today.

Activities are planned in more than twenty countries to get millions of people in the developing world to wash their hands with soap. 150,000 bars of soap were given to schools in prefix = st1 /Ethiopia, where the Education Ministry asked 1,000,000 schoolchildren to wash their hands for _ .   Experts say people around the world wash their hands but very few use soap at critical moments such as after using the toilet, after cleaning a baby and before touching food.  The organizers say all soaps are equally effective at removing disease-causing germs . They say the correct way to wash is to wet your hands with a small amount of water and cover them with soap. Rub it into all areas, including under the fingernails. Rub for at least 20 seconds.  Then, wash your hands well under running water.

Each one had to read a paragraph or two about a certain topic, then answer questions about it. In the first part, the participants had 15 minutes to understand and then answer questions about six readings. Throughout this test, they met no distractions. During a new set of readings, the brothers sent messages to the participants' cell phones every 90 seconds. In each message, there were questions that required a reply. Participants should have scored better on the second test because it was easier. In fact, they scored worse when distracted by messages.

But theory, logic and history suggest that he's wrong in his conclusions. I would recommend to Rubio one of the classics of conservative  thought, Milton Friedman's \"Capitalism and Freedom.\" He doesn't have to spend too much time on it. The first chapter outlines the \"relation between economic freedom and political freedom.\" The point Friedman makes in the book is one that America's founding fathers well understood. Drawing on the political philosopher John Locke, they believed that the freedom to buy, sell, own and trade were primary elements of human freedom and individual autonomy . As they expand, liberty expands. This is not just theory, of course. Over the last two centuries, the countries that embraced \"more commerce and access to money and goods\" in Rubio's phrase -- Britain, America, then Western Europe and East Asia -- have moved toward greater prosperity, but also political freedom. If you exclude oil-rich countries, where money is not earned but dug from the ground, on the whole there has been a strong connection between economic freedom and political freedom. In Latin America today, democracy  and markets have acted to strengthen each other, transforming the continent, which 30 years ago was almost entirely ruled by dictatorships  to one that is today almost entirely ruled by democracies. After opening up its economy in the 1970s, Chile began to grow, but that growth then produced a stronger civil society that over time contributed to the end of the dictatorship within the country. Yet Cuba is an outlier, one of the last regimes in Latin America that has embraced neither markets nor ballots. The Obama administration is acting on the theory that more commerce, capitalism, contact, travel and trade will empower the people of Cuba and thus gives them a greater voice in their political future. And so the first point to make is that it will help Cubans economically -- it will raise their incomes, their standard of living, and boost access to technology. These are all good things in and of themselves. But easing the embargo  will also help Americans, who will benefit from being able to trade with a neighbor. This is the reason that conservatives have long understood that free trade is not a gift bestowed on someone. It helps both countries and in particular, helps the United States.

They feast on marine mammals such as seals, sea lions, and even whales, employing teeth that can be four inches (ten centimeters) long. They are known to grab seals right off the ice. They also eat fish, squid  , and seabirds. Though they often frequent cold, coastal waters, orcas can be found from the polar regions to the Equator  . Killer whales hunt in deadly groups, family groups of up to 40 individuals. There appear to be both permanent and temporary group populations of killer whales. These different groups may hunt different animals and use different techniques to catch them. Permanent groups tend to prefer fish, while temporary groups target marine mammals. All groups use effective, cooperative hunting techniques that some are similar to the behavior of wolf packs. Whales make a wide variety of communicative sounds, and each group has various noises that its members will recognize even at a distance. They use echolocation   to communicate and hunt, making sounds that travel underwater until they meet objects, then reflect back, showing their location, size, and shape.

As a child, Jobs preferred doing things by himself. He was a competitive swimmer at school, but was not interested in any other team sports or other group activities. He showed an early interest in electronics. He spent a lot of time working in the garage workshop of a neighbor who was an electronics manufacturer.    He went to college but decided to drop out.

Many people enjoy the advantages of working part-time, but benefits are rarely offered to part-time employees. Most people are hoping for health insurance and retirement benefits when taking a job. Traditionally, companies only offer benefits to employees who work 30 hours or more a week. This is only a 25% reduction in hours, so it doesn't free up a lot of time for the employee who needs part-time hours.

Many businesses hire part-time employees for the simple reason of saving money. If they work less than a certain number of hours, the employers don't need to pay for benefits. There are companies, however, that are beginning to offer benefits to part-time employees. This includes benefits for health, paid time off and retirement plans. Some companies have begun to offer this in order to take in high quality, trained professionals who just want part-time hours.

Addwaita, which means \"the one and only\" in the local Bengali language, was one of four Aldabra tortoises brought to India by British sailors in the 18th century.

However, as soon as he accepted the idea, his career took off.The father of two children is rarely at home these days.Recently a group of reporters followed him on a tour of the school Obama once attended.Anas sat in the classroom where the present US president once studied.He spoke a few lines in English.The moment he opened his mouth, however, the differences became clear.\"Obama is a baritone  ,\"Anas said.\"I'm not.I sound like a little boy.\" He is also shorter than the president, but he makes up for that by practicing Obama's typical actions.        He used to dislike looking into the mirror because of his average appearance.Now he no longer considers himself as an average guy, but a superstar.Looking like a president is a good thing, Anas says.\"How else could a person like me travel the world and meet all kinds of people? I'm really just a shy guy.\"        He says he has made a request to meet President Obama when he arrives, but he hasn't heard back from the president's schedules.        Now, Anas hopes that Obama will win a second term in the White House.\"The longer he's in office, the longer my fame will last,\" he said. What is the best title for the text?", "subject": ""}

Five years on, the card is an increasingly sought-after document. On August 15, 2004, the Regulations on Examination and Approval of Permanent Residence oAliens in China created a Green Card system granting qualified foreigners the right to live in China permanently. Liu Lili, who works in the Exit and Entry Administration of Beijing Municipal Public Security Bureau, has watched the Green Card system develop since its inception. She said nearly all applications received by the Bureau are approved. So far, 323 people have been granted a \"Green Card\" qualifying them for permanent residence in Beijing. Another 15 are awaiting final approval. It takes around 6 months to process each application. Of the 323 Green Card holders, 94 are wives or husbands of Chinese citizens; 50 are minors dependent on their parents; 20 are senior citizens returning to live with relatives; 114 are individuals who have made outstanding contributions or are of special importance to China (another 7 are their family members); and 23 are high-level foreign personnel who hold posts in businesses (another 15 are their family members). Liu said the authorities had been granting residence to returning senior citizens for some time before the Green Card system was formally launched .The government has approved permanent residence for over 3,000 foreigners since the implementation of the Law on Control of the Entry and Exit of Aliens which was adopted by the Standing Committee of the National People's Congress in November 1985. Four groups of people are eligible for permanent residence: high-level foreign personnel who hold posts in businesses that promote China's economic, scientific and technological development or social progress; foreign citizens who make large  direct investments in China; persons who have made outstanding contributions or are of special importance to China; and people who come to China to be with family, such as husbands and wives, minors dependent on their parents, and senior citizens dependent on their relatives. Liu said that most applications she dealt with were from American citizens. Why do overseas citizens apply for permanent residence status in China? The main concern, aid Liu, is the political factor. Once people have a \"Green Card\", they feel they are accepted and trusted by the Chinese government. The \"Green Card\" also facilitates entry and exit. With permanent residence status, visas are no longer needed and people can enter and leave the country using only a valid passport. China offers outstanding career opportunities and is seen by many as safer and more secure than many other countries, said Liu. Liu said that Green Card holders have the same rights and responsibilities as Chinese citizens. However the card is not equivalent to Chinese nationality and holders are not allowed to vote in elections, hold political office, or serve in the military. Obtaining a Green Card is not easy. The qualifying conditions are tough. Unless you are a close relative of a Chinese citizen,you will either have to invest a substantial amount of money in the country or make a genuinely outstanding contribution to the country's development.

It's an important concern: Being weight or obese during childhood can lead to serious problems normally seen in adults, such as diabetes and high blood pressure.

Scientists in Finland recently found just such a link. In a recent study, they showed that overweight kids had different species of bacteria living in their guts. You probably think of bacteria only as germs that can make you sick. While it's true that some bacteria can make people ill, your body actually depends on some types of bacteria to help you digest food and extract nutrients from it. These \"good\" bacteria live in your guts, where they process the food you eat. Human babies get these bacterial helpers from their moms. When a baby is born, some of the bacteria in the mother move into the baby's body. Growing babies get additional \"good\" bacteria from the milk their mothers produce. And it turns out the bacteria might play an important role in regulating weight just six years later. So how could these bacteria affect weight?

And it turns out the bacteria might play an important role in regulating weight just six years later. So how could these bacteria affect weight?

Many of us want our children to have a little taste of everything, from organized sports to music, dance and more. But we can overdo it, leaving our children feeling a little burnt out, and according to parent educator Diane Loisie ,it's their school work which suffers the most. \"After school, if they're busy in a number of sporting events, besides they need to do their homework, then the time they'll feel sleepy is in the classroom. Your child needs free time. So if you're filling up that after school time, then it's during the day that they're going to be taking a break.\" Professor Claire McDermott agrees that there's a lot to be gained from sometimes putting those scheduled lessons and activities away. \"Relaxing time is important for children. It's time just to do the things they want to do. A child can go up to their room, or they can play around. It doesn't look like productive time; parents certainly wouldn't be saying 'Wow, are they ever learning things now?' But this relaxing time gives both the body and the brain just a wonderful chance to relax after a day.

After all, many of us want our children to have a head start in life and the chance to join in great activities in the arts or sports is a part of that. However, Loisie feels that in the long run most children feel better with just a few key activities because it gives them an opportunity to master them. \"When we get our children in too many activities because we want our children to experience everything, then what we're doing is setting them up not to be good at one thing or gaining a skill.\" So choose your children's activities wisely.

I've decided to re-establish the 5-paragraph essay as the goal for the composition course. I interviewed some of my former students and they all agreed that being able to write critically and continuouslywas important to them. So next academic year, Term 1 will be like always: sentences to paragraphing. And Term 2 will work toward the 5-paragraph essay. The final 3 weeks of Term 2 will be reserved tointroduce writing for TOEFL and CEE. By that time, if the students have done their job correctly, then they should be able to write quite well. As for the Latin course, I will post notices around campus next week so that the students will understand what's on offer before I actually introduce the course. A number of students already emailed me about the course. I am sure you don't understand what a big deal our opening this program at our school is. People around the world are interested in what we plan to do. There are many rewards available to the students who succeed in the course. Please share what I have said with the administration. I want them to understand the importance of this course. The reason I have contacted these colleagues (actually Oxford contacted me) isthatI have confidence in our students and in myself. I know that when those professors meet our students and hear them speaking and reading Latin, they are going to be amazed.

As China opens its doors, studying abroad has become a dream for many Chinese students. They want to learn about the world. It's true that studying abroad can help students develop themselves. Language skills will improve and it may be easier to find jobs. But there are problems that should be considered. Language is the first.
