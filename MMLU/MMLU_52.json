E-books are all over the Internet; some are free, and some are not. E-books are basically electronic books you can read without having to carry heavy books and flip through   all the pages. Now authors not only sell regular books in bookstores but also sell e-books on the Internet. Some e-books are sold on CDs, too.     You can get all types of software right from the Internet. After you download it, you have it. It is so convenient that you can get it even without leaving the house. These are the advantages we have in today's high-tech world.    We can find videos of different people. There are so many websites with videos that it would take you some time to actually go through them all. The cool thing about videos is that some people have their own websites or their own spaces where they can upload videos of their families or of different events and allow other people to view them. It is amazing.     The Internet is an exciting place and it plays a big part in our lives today. You can even pay your bills on the Internet if that's what you want to do. The marketing industry is also doing a lot better because of the Internet. Companies can communicate very quickly with each other over the Internet.

ClearPath uses two and a half years worth of traffic data from 9,000 sensors on the roads of L.A..It also collects information on accidents. Professor Shahabi says his system does more than just respond to current traffic conditions.With ClearPath,he says,a driver can enter what time he wants to leave on a specific time and date,and ClearPath will give the fastest route.It looks at the entire road network,including surface streets as well as highways,before the driver hits the road. Ugur Demiryurek says they will launch the free ClearPath app for roads in L.A.in two months.In a year,he and Professor Shahabi hope to have ClearPath available nationwide and overseas once they can collect traffic data from other cities. \"I thought always that L.A.had the worst traffic,but now I know that Shanghai,Beijing,Seoul,Tokyo,believe it or not,Singapore,Hong Kong definitely are examples that can immediately use this.\" The ClearPath app can mainly be used to   _  .", "subject": ""}

Whenever I feel my own life taking a turn for the worse, as if things will never get better, I remember how many years he lived fighting such a scary and difficult disease. He died with a huge party going on around him, with all his friends and family. They ate and I honestly didn't know how to cope. I never cried alone.

It's not that you don't have enough. In fact you usually have too much time, and as a result time gets wasted. If you take good notes in class, and spend one hour reviewing your notes every day before going to sleep, you will make use of the power of the subconscious to absorb information and by the time exams come around you'll know all the material on a subconscious level, and you don't have to sit up the night before exams. Select Easy Courses The reason why selecting easy courses is powerful is that it allows you to start off your college career with an extremely high GPA. Good grades have less and less of an impact on your GPA later in your college career and raising your GPA becomes much more difficult. Selecting easy courses in the first term also leaves room for the occasional failure when coursework become more challenging. Join (or Form) Study Groups If you go to a large public school where classes often have 700 plus people, study groups are an extremely effective way to ensure good grades. Study groups are often led by older students who have taken the course and received A's in that particular course. They also often provide you with resources such as practice tests, practice problems, and many others that might not be provided by professors.

He was 95. Those 95 years were remarkable. At the age of seven, he entered a local school, where he was given the name \"Nelson\", after Admiral Horatio Nelson of the Royal Navy, by a teacher who had difficulty in pronouncing his African 'name. That name, Rolihlahla , means  \"troublemaker\" . In 1927, when Mandela was nine, he decided to become a lawyer, influenced by the cases that came on his father. In 1942 Mandela entered politics by joining the African National Congress (ANC), South Africa's major liberation movement and today the country's ruling party. It was during this time that he and a small group of mainly young members of the ANC got down to a task transforming the party into a mass movement. In 1952, he was charged and brought to trial for his role in the campaign of fighting against Unjust Laws and given a prison sentence. The 1950s turned out to be a time of hardship and suffering for Mandela-he was banned, arrested and imprisoned.    While in prison, Mandela studied by correspondence with the University of London, earning a Bachelor of Law degree. He never faced with his teachers, but his name was familiar to all the teachers by means of his writing letters.    After spending 27 years in prison, Mandela became South Africa's first democratically elected president in 1994. He united a fearful country, bringing together blacks and whites in harmony When South Africa was living through violent and troubled times. After serving a five year term as president of the country, he retired from public life, though not from the public eye.     He is the greatest son of the nation and a great father of his people. More than l, 115 awards and honors, even the Nobel Peace Prize had been on him. More than 85 streets, roads, avenues, bridges, highways had been named after Mandela.

But in the past five years, growing scientific evidence has shown these drugs work for only a minority of people. And now a research journal says that these antidepressants can make many patients' depression worse. This alarming suggestion centres on the very chemical that is targeted by antidepressants-serotonin . Drugs such as Prozac are known as selective serotonin re-uptake inhibitors(or SSRIs). Their aim is to increase the level of this  \"feel-good\" chemical in the brain. But the new research, published in the journal Frontiers In Evolutionary Psychology, points out that serotonin is like a chemical Swiss Army knife, performing a very wide range of jobs in the brain and body. And when we start changing serotonin levels purposely, it may cause a wide range of unwanted effects. These can include digestive problems and even early deaths in older people, according to the study's lead researcher Paul Andrews. \" We need to be much more cautious about use of these drugs,\" says Andrews, an assistant professor of evolutionary psychology at McMaster University in Ontario, Canada. Previous research has suggested that the drugs provide little benefit for most people with mild depression, and actively help only a few of the most severely depressed. Famous psychologist Irving Kirsch has found that for many patients, SSRIs are no more effective than a placebo pill. A research in 2010 on Danish children found a small, but significant, increase in the risk of heart problems among babies whose mothers had used SSRIs in early pregnancy. The key to understanding these side-effects is serotonin, says Andrews. Serotonin is also the reason why patients can often end up feeling still more depressed after they have finished a course of SSRI drugs. He argues that SSRI antidepressants disturb the brain, leaving the patient an even greater depression than before. \"After long use, when a patient stops taking SSRIs, the brain will lower its levels of serotonin production,\" he says, adding that it also changes the way receptors in the brain respond to serotonin, making the brain less sensitive to the chemical. These changes are believed to be temporary, but studies indicate that the effects may continue for up to two years. Most disturbingly of all, Andrews' review features three recent studies which, he says , show that elderly antidepressant users are more likely to die earlier than non-users, even after taking other important variables into account. One study, published in the British Medical Journal last year, found patients given SSRIs were more than 4 per cent more likely to die in the next year than those not on the drugs. \"Serotonin is an ancient chemical,\" says Andrews. \"It is regulating many different processes, and when you disturb these things, you can expect that it is going to cause some harm.\" Stafford Lightman, professor of medicine at the University of Bristol, and a leading UK expert in brain chemicals and hormones, says Andrews' review highlights some important problems, yet it should also be taken with a pinch of salt. \"This report is doing the opposite of what drug companies do,\" he says. \"Drug companies selectively present all the positives in their research, while this search selectively presents all the negatives that can be found. Nevertheless, Andrews' study is useful in that it is always worth pointing out that there is a downside to any medicine. \" Professor Lightman adds that there is still a great deal we don't know about SSRIs-not least what they actually do in our brains. When it comes to understanding why the drugs work only for a limited part of patients, U.S.  scientists think they might now have the answer.

Some people may be greedy, and others are simply too lazy to bother  with the trip to the post office to send back a wallet to a stranger. But according to a psychology study by Dr. Richard Wiseman, there's one thing that'll greatly increase your odds of being reunited with a lost wallet: a photograph of a cute baby. In the study, hundreds of wallets were scattered  around the streets of Edinburgh, Scotland. The psychologists wanted to see how many strangers would take the trouble to return them to the addresses listed on the drivers' licenses inside--but more than that, they wanted to find out what would make a person more likely to help out a stranger. To finish this, they included personal things in most of the wallets: some included a photo of a happy elderly couple, some contained a cute puppy, some contained a family portrait, and some held a photo of a lovely baby. Others had receipts  showing that the wallet's owner had recently donated to a charity . Some contained no personal details. As the psychologists soon discovered, the sight of a smiling baby is enough to warm nearly any heart: only one in ten of the strangers who _ such wallets did not return them. In contrast, the second most successful image, the puppy, had a 53% return rate. When the wallet included no photograph, it stood only a one in seven chance of being returned to the owner. The success of the baby photograph shows a human compassion  for the young that's been passed down through the ages, according to Dr. Wiseman. \"The baby kicked off a caring feeling in people, which is not surprising from an evolutionary perspective ,\" he told theTimes.

Scientists say that this study supports the argument that we won't feel compassion only for our own babies, but for any that we see--hence, the strong desire a stranger would feel to return a wallet to the baby's parent.

Students at one school in New Mexico can earn up to three hundred dollars a year for good attendance. In Baltimore, Maryland, high scores in state graduation tests can be worth more than one hundred dollars. And a New Jersey school system plans to pay students fifty dollars a week to attend after---school tutoring programs. Schools that pay students can be found in more than one---fourth of the fifty states. Other schools pay students with food or other rewards. Robert Schaefer is a public education director. He says paying students may improve performance in the short term, but students develop false expectations for the future. He sees a lack of long term planning in these programs because of the pressure on schools to raise test scores. Public schools need to show improvement under the education reform law. Low---performing schools may lose their federal money; teachers and administrators  may lose their jobs. Often these schools are in poor neighborhoods where getting students to go to school can be a continual problem. Critics  say paying students sends a message that money is the only valuable reward. But some students say it makes school more exciting. And some teachers have reported getting more requests for extra help.

{"answer": 1, "choices": ["Work sharing requires more working hours.", "Work sharing is aimed at creating more jobs.", "Work sharing provides a more satisfactory salary.", "Work sharing depends on the employer's decision."], "question": "Job sharing refers to the situation in which two people divide the responsibility of one full-time job. The people willingly act as part-time workers, enough hours between them to fulfill the duties of a full-time worker. If they each work half the job, for example, they each receive 50 percent of the job's wages, its holidays and its other benefits. Job sharing differs from conventional  part-time work in that it occurs mainly in the more highly skilled and professional areas, which require higher levels of responsibility and employee commitment. Job sharing should not be confused with the term work sharing, which refers to increasing the number of jobs by reducing the number of hours of each existing job, thus offering more positions to the growing number of unemployed people. Job sharing by contrast, is not designed to address the growing number of unemployed people. Job sharing, by contrast, is not designed to address unemployment problems; its focus, rather is to provide well-paid work for skilled workers and professionals who want more free time for other activities. As would be expected, most job sharers are women. A survey carried out in 1988 by Britain's Equal Opportunities Commission showed that 78 per cent of sharers were female, the majority of whom were between 20 and 40 years of age. Subsequent studies have come up with similar results. Many of these women were re-entering the job market after having had children, but they chose not to seek part-time work because it would have meant lower status. Job sharing also offered an acceptable shift back into full-time work after a long absence. The necessity of close cooperation when sharing a job with another person makes the actual work quite different from conventional one-position jobs. However, to ensure a greater chance that the partnership will succeed, each person needs to know the strengths, weaknesses and preferences of his or her partner before applying for a position. Moreover, there must be a fair division of both routine tasks and interesting ones. In sum, for a position to be job-shared well, the two individuals must be well matched and must treat each other as equals. In what way is work sharing different from job sharing?", "subject": ""}

Not to say that we were surrounded by it, but the accessibility of game parks and wildlife sanctuaries(,) always made it seem like a natural part of the environment. For this reason, I suppose that the way my European friends used to talk to me, wasn't so strange after all. They would ask me what I thought at the time were really silly questions which got on my nerves. They'd say things like 'Do you have a pet baboon?' or 'Do you travel to school by elephant?'. When Amanda, a friend of mine who was visiting from England, invited me to join her and a group of friends on a wildlife expedition, I was not filled with enthusiasm. However, from the moment we entered the gates of the Zaluzi game reserve, I knew that this was not going to be anything like I had expected. We had been traveling along the National Road when, suddenly, we turned onto a dirt track which seemed to be hidden in the middle of nowhere. Amazingly, the scenery changed dramatically. The civilized environment took on a wild, chaotic(;) aspect and continued to do so as we walked deeper into the bush. After having a good night's sleep at one of the reserve's bungalows, we were woken at the crack of dawn. After a quick breakfast we piled into a jeep and set off.

It did cross my mind, however, that we might be in a certain amount of danger. When I asked Timothy, our game ranger, if we were actually in any danger, he replied straightforwardly that one is never entirely safe in the bush, but his knowledge and experience allowed him to anticipate any danger with reasonable accuracy. However, the following day there was some cause for alarm. Not having started out so early, we missed the sightings of the day before. We decided to drive around for a while, hoping to come across something of interest. Suddenly our tracker perched up on the back of our vehicle, signaled to the driver to halt and at the same moment I realized that this time we had stumbled right into a pride of lions. The driver promptly turned off the engine and in a low voice warned us to remain seated and not to make any abrupt movements. The lions were picking at what looked like the remains of a zebra.

I shall soon start my studies at King's College.   So far I've been learning about British ways of living. I won' tell you about London in a traditional way, because there are plenty of books you can read and plenty of pictures you can look at. I'm sure you'll be more interested to know what I think about the life here. I find some of the customs new and interesting. People here do not shake hands so much as we do in Asia. During the first few weeks I was often surprised because people did not put out their hands when I met them. Men raised their hats to women, but not to each other. Yours ever,  Anne Men in England_.", "subject": ""}

The Internet had just taken off in 1991 and people were only using office and PCbased email exchanges. In the mid 1990s external email providers appeared. The most famous of these was Hotmail, the first free email provider and webbased email service. Sabeer Bhatia and Jack Smith launched Hotmail on July 4, 1996. And Microsoft took note of and bought Hotmail for $400 million on December 30, 1997, a nice birthday present for Bhatia who turned 29 that day. It was relaunched as MSN Hotmail and in 2007 was relaunched again as Windows Live Hotmail. Fast forward the present day and most of us have at least a personal webbased email account. It seems impossible to live without them. One of the biggest advantages of email is the fact that communication has become so much easier, especially with those across different time zones. Email takes seconds to send a message whereas letters, as we used to communicate by, could take weeks. Of course there was the fax, that beeping invention from the 1980s, but it wasn't as secure as email and you never knew if the person on the other end had picked up your fax or if it had got lost somewhere in the office. In conclusion, one of the best inventions from the 1990s has to be email. But sometimes people are too closely connected to their email and have a _ to check it several times a day. At work, people have become lazy and instead of going to speak to the person sitting next to them, they send an email,causing an in box to pile up with more time spent reading email and responding rather than working. Clearly, an invention that saved time because of its quick and speedy connection can now also cause us to waste a lot of time. The earliest web-based email came into being probably   _  .", "subject": ""}
{"answer": 1, "choices": ["a sound mind is less important than a good health", "our mind has a strong effect on our body", "our physical health has nothing to do with our mind", "mental health mainly depends on our physical health"], "question": "\"Mind over matter\" is an English saying meaning that we can control our bodies with our minds. Now scientists are finding increasing evidence that our mind can have a great effect on our physical health. Since our mind influences how we feel, it's not true to say if someone is ill just because he feels ill. The influence of the mind on how well we feel is the basis of what is known as the placebo effect. A placebo (which is Latin for \"I shall please\") is a harmless, inactive substance. Patients are sometimes given placebo pills and begin to feel better because they believe that they have been given real drugs and expect to respond to them. The placebo effect is very strong: research on pain suggests that up to 30% of the effect of most painkillers is a placebo effect. So if it is so powerful, why don't doctors use it today? According to Dr Persaud, they really do. \"All these things like seeing a doctor, going to a hospital, and being scanned  have a very strong placebo effect,\" he says.

{"answer": 2, "choices": ["with his family", "with Evelyn", "alone", "with his children"], "question": "I made a promise to myself on the way down to the vacation beach cottage. For two weeks I would try to be a loving husband and father. Totally loving. No ifs, ands or buts. The idea had come to me as I listened to a talk on my car radio.

A person can choose to love.\" To myself, I had to admit that I had been a selfish husband. Well, for two weeks that would change. And it did. On arriving at the beach cottage, I kissed Evelyn meeting me at the door and said, \"That new yellow sweater looks great on you.\" \"Oh, Tom, you noticed\", she said, surprised and pleased. Maybe a little puzzled. After the long drive, I wanted to sit and read. Evelyn suggested a walk on the beach. I started to refuse, but then I thought, \"Evelyn's been alone here with the kids all week and now she wants to be alone with me.\" We walked on the beach while the children flew their kites. So it went. Two weeks of not calling the Wall Street firm where I am a director; a visit to the shell museum though I usually hate museums. Relaxed and happy, that's how the whole vacation passed. I made a new promise to keep on remembering to choose love. There was one thing that went wrong with my experiment, however. Evelyn and I still laugh about it today. On the last night at our cottage, preparing for bed, Evelyn stared at me with the saddest expression. \"What's the matter?\" I asked her. \"Tom,\" she said in a voice filled with distress, \"I don't?\" \"What do you mean?\" \"Well...that checkup I had several weeks ago...our doctor...did he tell you something about me?

From there, the couple, in their 20s, were forced to shelter for 24 hours on the cement   floor of a shopping centre with 2,500 others. \"Trees were being knocked over and big branches were put down across the streets, \" Mr. Svanstrom told Sweden's Expressen newspaper. \"We escaped by the skin of our teeth.\" Mr. Svanstrom said they then headed south to Brisbane but the city was experiencing massive flooding, so they crossed the country to Perth where they narrowly escaped burning bush fires. The couple then flew to Christchurch, New Zealand, arriving just after a massive magnitude   6.3 earthquake attacked the city on February 22. Mrs. Svanstrom said, \"When we got there the whole town was like a war zone. We could not visit the city since it was completely blocked off, so instead we travelled around before going to Japan.\" But days after the Svanstroms arrived, Tokyo was rocked by Japan's largest earthquake since records began. \"The trembling was horrible and we saw roof tiles fly off the buildings,\" Mr. Svanstrom said. \"It was like the buildings were swaying back and forth.\" The family returned to Stockholm on March 29 after a much calmer visit to their last destination China. But Mr. Svanstrom --- who also survived the destructive Boxing Day tsunami that hit southeast Asia in 2004 --- said the marriage was still going strong. He added, \"I know marriages have to experience some difficulties, but I think we have been through most of them.

The arrival of a letter will be followed by two others within a certain period. Another belief involving the number three has it that it is unlucky to light three cigarettes from the one match. If this happens, the bad luck that goes with the deed falls upon the person whose cigarette was the last to be lit. The ill-men linked to the lighting of three things from one match or candle goes back to at least the 17th century and probably earlier. It was believed that three candles alight at the same time would be sure to bring bad luck; one, two, or four, were permissible, but never just three. Seven was another significant number, usually regarded as a bringer of good luck. The ancient astrologers believed that the universe was governed by seven planets; students of Shakespeare will recall that the life of man was divided into seven ages. Seven horseshoes nailed to a house will protect it from all evil. Nine is usually thought of as a lucky number because it is the product of three times three. It was much used by the Anglo Saxons in their charms for healing. Another belief was that great changes occurred every 7th and 9th of a man's life.

This being the eve of his betrayal, it is not difficult to understand the significance given to the number by the early Christians. In more modern times 13 is an especially unlucky number of a dinner party, for example.

Maybe that is why there are so many expressions that use the word \"cold\". For centuries, the body's blood has been linked closely with the emotions. People who show no human emotions or feelings, for example, are said to be cold-blooded. Cold-blooded people act in merciless ways. They may do brutal things to others, and not by accident. For example, a newspaper says the police are searching for a cold-blooded killer. The killer murdered someone, not in self-defense. He seemed to kill for no reason, and with no emotion, as if taking someone's life meant nothing. Cold can affect other parts of the body, the feet, for example. Heavy socks can you're your feet, if your feet are really cold. But there is an expression--to get cold feet--that has nothing to do with cold or your feet. The expression means being afraid to do something you have decided to do. For example, you agree to be president of an organization. But then you learn that all the other officers have resigned. All the work of the organization will be your responsibility. You are likely to get cold feet about being the president when you understand the situation. Cold can also affect your shoulder. You give someone the cold shoulder when you refuse to speak to them. You treat them in a distant and cold way. The expression probably comes from the physical act of turning your back toward someone, instead of speaking to him face-to-face. You may give a cold shoulder to a friend who has not kept a promise he made to you, or to someone who has lied about you to others. A cold fish is not a fish. It is a person. But it is a person who is unfriendly, unemotional and shows no love or warmth. A cold fish does not offer much of himself to anyone. Out in the cold is an expression often heard.

A self-employed jobber, he was always building things out of odds and ends. When we were kids, he always created something surprising for us. Today, however, Dad would say no more, and caught ups in the busyness of our new life, I eventually forgot about his surprise. Until one gloomy day the following March when I glanced out of the window. Any yet... I saw a dot of blue across the yard. I headed outside for a closer look. They were crocuses  , throughout the front lawn. Lavender, blue, yellow and my favorite pink ---- little faces moved up and down in the cold wind. Dad! I smiled, remembering the things he had secretly planted last autumn. He knew how the darkness and dullness of winter always got me down. What could have been more perfectly timely to my needs? My father's crocuses bloomed each spring for the next four or five seasons, bringing the same assurance every time they arrived: hard times was almost over. Hold on, keep going, light is coming soon. Then a spring came with only half the usual blooms. The next spring there were none. I missed the crocuses. I would ask Dad to come over and plant new bulbs. But I never did. He died suddenly one October day. My family was in deep sorrow, leaning on our faith. I missed him terribly. Four years passed, and on a dismal spring afternoon I was driving back when I found myself feeling depressed. \"You've got the winter depression again and you get them every year.\" I told myself. It was Dad's birthday, and I found myself thinking about him. This was not unusual --- my family often talked about him, remembering how he lived his faith.

{"answer": 0, "choices": ["faith", "family", "love", "friendship"], "question": "It was an autumn morning shortly after my husband and I moved into our first house. Children were upstairs unpacking , and I was looking out of the window at my father moving around mysteriously on the front lawn. My parents lived nearby ,and Dad had visited us several times already. \"What are you doing out there?\" I called to him .He looked up, smiling. \"I'm making you a surprise.\" Knowing my father, I thought it could be just about anything. A self-employed jobber, he was always building things out of odds and ends. When we were kids, he always created something surprising for us. Today, however, Dad would say no more, and caught ups in the busyness of our new life, I eventually forgot about his surprise. Until one gloomy day the following March when I glanced out of the window. Any yet... I saw a dot of blue across the yard. I headed outside for a closer look. They were crocuses  , throughout the front lawn. Lavender, blue, yellow and my favorite pink ---- little faces moved up and down in the cold wind. Dad! I smiled, remembering the things he had secretly planted last autumn. He knew how the darkness and dullness of winter always got me down. What could have been more perfectly timely to my needs? My father's crocuses bloomed each spring for the next four or five seasons, bringing the same assurance every time they arrived: hard times was almost over. Hold on, keep going, light is coming soon. Then a spring came with only half the usual blooms. The next spring there were none. I missed the crocuses. I would ask Dad to come over and plant new bulbs. But I never did. He died suddenly one October day. My family was in deep sorrow, leaning on our faith. I missed him terribly. Four years passed, and on a dismal spring afternoon I was driving back when I found myself feeling depressed. \"You've got the winter depression again and you get them every year.\" I told myself. It was Dad's birthday, and I found myself thinking about him. This was not unusual --- my family often talked about him, remembering how he lived his faith. Once I saw him give his coat to a homeless man. Suddenly I slowed as I turned into our driveway. I stopped and stared at the lawn. And there on the muddy grass and small gray piles of melting snow, bravely waving in the wind, was one pink crocus. How could a flower bloom from a bulb more than 18 years old, one that had not blossomed in over a decade? But there was the crocus. Tears filled my eyes as I realized its significance.

Not too long after we arrived and unpacked, we were invited for \"a drink on Sunday morning\" by a retired couple nearby. We got there about noon, to find the living-room crowded -- lots of chat and discussions, and in all a very jolly occasion. Trouble was, there was no food -- no self-respecting Australian would regard a tray of crisps as food. In Sydney, when you are invited for a drink any time after midday on a Sunday, you know you will be fed as well as watered and you plan accordingly. Meaning the hardworked little woman makes no plans to cook lunch because you are eating out. By one-fifteen my stomach was sending up \"please explain\" to me. Even the crisps had gone. There was nothing we could do except wait, and wonder if the hostess was going to perform some magic and feed us fashionably late. Then, as quickly as if word had spread that there was free beer at the local pub, the room emptied. By one-forty-five there were only a few guests left, so we decided to go home. Tinned soup for lunch that day because the little woman was not really interested in real cooking for us. A few weeks ago we were invited out for \"supper\" and the hostess suggested 8:15. Ah, we thought greedily, \"this is going to be the real thing.\" We dressed with some care -- I putting on a dark suit -- and arrived on time. My wife looked pretty good, I thought, a little black dress and so on. But when we walked in I had a terrible feeling we had got the night wrong because the hostess was dressed in a daytime kind of way and the husband was in jeans and an open-neck shirt. But no, we were greeted and shown into the sitting-room. After a drink I looked around and saw that this was indeed a superior cottage because it had a (more or less) separate dining-room. But there were no signs of a table-setting. Not again! I thought. Were we meant to eat before we came? I decided that in future my wife and I would always carry a chocolate bar. About 9:28 our hostess went out of the room, saying something about food. Ten minutes later she returned and asked us to follow. We were led out to the kitchen. There on the table were country style plates and a huge bowl of soup, rough bread and all the makings of a simple meal. And that is what it was.

Live Below Your Means There will always be temptation to give up the future for immediate pleasure. We all want to buy that new piece of technology, treat ourselves to an expensive night on the town, or take out a loan for the flashy car we can't afford. It might feel great at the time but unwise spending hurts a lot later on. Enjoy life's simple pleasures and save as much as you can. Expensive things don't create lasting happiness and security. Careful spending will bring you greater leisure and enjoyment in the long run. 2. Put Your Money to Work Saving is great, but to make the most of your money you need to put it to work. Good investments can be the difference between retiring in your 40's or in your 60's. A post today at The Simple Dollar really got me thinking. According to Trent's estimates, if a person in their early 20's invests 20% of their income in an S&P index fund, the interest they earn will equal their current salary when they reach their early 40's. They could retire without a drop in income! Wise investing is the surest path to financial independence and it's something everyone can work on. It's definitely an area I'll be devoting more attention to in my personal life. 3. Educate Yourself To be happy we need continuous growth. The best way to grow is life-long education. This doesn't mean you need to pursue a doctorate or spend 2 hours reading every day. Self-education can be anything that takes you out of your comfort zone. The important part is keeping an open mind and searching for fresh ideas and perspectives. Education builds over time. It might feel like the bits of wisdom you acquire don't mean much, but over the years they add up to form a wiser, kinder, more interesting person. 4.

Halloween was referred to as All Hallows Eve and dates back to over 2000 years ago. The American tradition of \"trick-or-treating\" probably dates back to the early All Souls' Day marches in England. During the festivities, poor citizens would beg for food and families would give them pastries called \"soul cakes\" in return for their promise to pray for the family's dead relatives. The act of giving out soul cakes was encouraged by the church as a way to replace the ancient practice of leaving food and wine for homeless ghosts. The practice, which was referred to as \"going a-souling\" was finally taken up by children who would visit the houses in their neighborhood and be given sweets, food, and money. The tradition of dressing in costume  for Halloween has both European and Celtic roots. Hundreds of years ago, winter was an uncertain and frightening time. Food supplies were often not enough because people were afraid of the darkness and would stay at home without doing businesses.

My artificial eye was very convincing and I usually wore glasses over it -- even my boyfriend, Mick, didn't really notice. I told him I was blind in one eye just before we got married -- I was 19 at the time. He said he didn't care and that he loved me just the same. The day before we married, I was at my parents' house, when my other eye suddenly went blurry  . My dad phoned the doctor, who told him it was probably nerves  and I'd be fine by morning. He was right -- when I awoke, I was able to read my good luck cards. The wedding photographer arrived just as I was putting on my dress and I was called into the garden for a pre-ceremony photo. There was no time even to look in a mirror. Afterwards, we drove straight to the church. It was a sunny day, and as we approached I could see all our friends waiting. The service was delightful, and Mick and I went into the minister's office to sign the register -- the last thing I ever wrote with my sight. It was only when we reached the hotel, where the reception was taking place, that I started to feel strange. As we waited to greet our guests, my sight started to become blurry again and I really had to concentrate as our friends and family lined up to congratulate us. Afterwards, we went into the reception room, so the photographer could take our picture as we pretended to cut the cake. That's when the pain started. \"Don't let anyone know!\"my mum said. She'd always blamed herself for the loss of my other eye, wishing she'd taken me to the doctor earlier. Only a few family members had ever been told -- even my close friends had beennone the wiser. So even as the pain became more severe, I carried on as if nothing was happening. I'd waited so long for this day, and everyone seemed so happy, I didn't want to spoil things. I couldn't make anything out, but I managed tostay calm and made it through the meal and the speeches. I suppose it's normal for the bride and groom to stay close together after a wedding, and Mick led me around properly. We took regular dance lessons, so the first dance passed without incident, Mick leading me in a slow, graceful waltz. Afterwards, we left the building to see if a bit of air would improve the situation, but it didn't help, and nor did a lie-down. I still thought the blurriness would pass, as it had the night before. But I finally accepted that things just weren't going to get better on their own -- I was in so much pain. Mick sent for a doctor, who took one look at me and called for an ambulance. At the hospital, I remember a nurse bursting into tears when she saw me arrive -- I still had confetti   in my hair. I was diagnosed with glaucoma, a disease in the eye that causes terrible pressure -- it was unrelated to the problems I'd had as a child, just a coincidence. An operation to try to save my sight seemed successful at first -- as the bandages were removed, I remember seeing a vase of flowers at the end of the bed. But it's the last thing I ever saw.

I told him I was blind in one eye just before we got married -- I was 19 at the time. He said he didn't care and that he loved me just the same. The day before we married, I was at my parents' house, when my other eye suddenly went blurry  . My dad phoned the doctor, who told him it was probably nerves  and I'd be fine by morning. He was right -- when I awoke, I was able to read my good luck cards. The wedding photographer arrived just as I was putting on my dress and I was called into the garden for a pre-ceremony photo. There was no time even to look in a mirror. Afterwards, we drove straight to the church. It was a sunny day, and as we approached I could see all our friends waiting. The service was delightful, and Mick and I went into the minister's office to sign the register -- the last thing I ever wrote with my sight. It was only when we reached the hotel, where the reception was taking place, that I started to feel strange. As we waited to greet our guests, my sight started to become blurry again and I really had to concentrate as our friends and family lined up to congratulate us. Afterwards, we went into the reception room, so the photographer could take our picture as we pretended to cut the cake. That's when the pain started. \"Don't let anyone know!\"my mum said. She'd always blamed herself for the loss of my other eye, wishing she'd taken me to the doctor earlier. Only a few family members had ever been told -- even my close friends had beennone the wiser. So even as the pain became more severe, I carried on as if nothing was happening. I'd waited so long for this day, and everyone seemed so happy, I didn't want to spoil things. I couldn't make anything out, but I managed tostay calm and made it through the meal and the speeches. I suppose it's normal for the bride and groom to stay close together after a wedding, and Mick led me around properly. We took regular dance lessons, so the first dance passed without incident, Mick leading me in a slow, graceful waltz. Afterwards, we left the building to see if a bit of air would improve the situation, but it didn't help, and nor did a lie-down. I still thought the blurriness would pass, as it had the night before. But I finally accepted that things just weren't going to get better on their own -- I was in so much pain. Mick sent for a doctor, who took one look at me and called for an ambulance. At the hospital, I remember a nurse bursting into tears when she saw me arrive -- I still had confetti   in my hair. I was diagnosed with glaucoma, a disease in the eye that causes terrible pressure -- it was unrelated to the problems I'd had as a child, just a coincidence. An operation to try to save my sight seemed successful at first -- as the bandages were removed, I remember seeing a vase of flowers at the end of the bed. But it's the last thing I ever saw. It was hard, but I coped, and nearly 40 years on I feel I've had a full and active life. There are sights I'll always feel sad not to have seen -- the face of the daughter and my grandchildren. I'll always regret not finding the time to look in the mirror on the morning of my wedding, too -- despite everything that happened, I have happy memories of the ceremony. Why did the nurse at the hospital cry suddenly?", "subject": ""}

Although we had no money, between the covers of those books, I could go anywhere, do anything and be anybody. When I entered high school, I was an A-student, but not for long. I wanted the fancy clothes. I wanted to hang out with the guys. I went form being an A- student to a B- student to a C-student, but I didn't care. One night my mother came home and I complained about not having enough shirts. She said, \"Okay, I'll give you all the money I make this week cleaning floors and bathrooms, and you can buy the family food and pay the bills. With everything left over, you can have all the shirts you want.\" I was very pleased with that arrangement but once I got through allocating  money, there was nothing left.

It selves directly to bring about a rapid sale of goods at reasonable prices, so setting up a firm home market and so making it possible to provide for export at good prices. By drawing attention to new ideas it helps greatly to raise standards of living. By helping to increase demand it causes an increased need for labor, and is therefore a nice way to fight unemployment. It lowers the costs of many services: without advertisements your daily newspaper would cost four times as much, the price of your television program would need to be doubled, and travel by bus or subway would cost more. And perhaps most important of all, advertising provides a promise of reasonable value in the products and services you buy.

But if their goodness was put into an easy-to-swallow pill that you were told might prevent strokes  and heart attacks you would probably be putting in an order tomorrow. Researchers believe they may have come up with just that after trials. The daily pill contains a chemical called lycopene which makes tomatoes red and is known to break down fat in the vessels . A Cambridge University study found taking the pills improved blood flow and the lining of vessels in patients with pre-existing heart conditions. It also increased the flexibility  of their vessels by 50 percent. The scientists believe it could limit the damage caused by heart disease-responsible for 180,000 deaths a year-and help cut the 49,000 deaths a year from strokes. They also hope it could benefit those with arthritis , diabetes  and even slow the progress of cancer. Each pill is equal to eating around 61 pounds of ripe tomatoes. Studies have shown eating a Mediterranean-style diet rich in tomatoes fish, vegetables, nuts and olive oil can significantly reduce cholesterol  and help prevent cardiovascular disease. Preliminary results from a two-month trial, in which the pill was given to 36 heart disease patients and 36 healthy volunteers with an average age of 67, were presented at a meeting of the American Heart Association. It was shown to improve the function of the endothelium- the layer of cells lining blood vessels. It also improved their sensitivity to nitric oxide, the gas which causes the enlargement of the vessels in response to exercise.

{"answer": 2, "choices": ["A dry mouth.", "Stomach upset.", "Weight changes.", "A rise in blood pressure."], "question": "If you experience great stress in your life on a frequent basis, you're not alone. Nowadays, stress is almost a given fact of life. Actually, a certain degree of stress can have positive effects on us. But if stress continues over a long period of time, the effects on the body can be harmful, resulting in health problems and stress-related illness, including heart attack and stroke. Stress is a normal reaction by the body to what it perceives  as a threatening situation or environment. Short-term reactions may include an increase in heart rate as well as a rise in blood pressure. A person under short-term stress may feel nervous, anxious and even experience shortness of breath. Other reactions can include a dry mouth, quick heartbeat, sweating, stomach upset and diarrhea. When stress is long-term and becomes more chronic   in nature, it can cause more serious health-related problems, including regular headaches, back pain, weight changes, sleep difficulties, changes in mood and so on. Chronic stress can also result in memory problems, including difficulty remembering new information and the inability to quickly deal with old information. No matter how your body reacts to stress, ignoring the problem can have serious health results. Not surprisingly, more women than men openly seek the help of their family doctors or other health care experts when they are experiencing stress or stress-related illness. Men are more likely to refuse to admit the problem or attempt to self-treat it, which may contribute to higher rate of drug and alcohol addiction seen in men exposed to chronic stress. There's no doubt that stress is a fact of life and is likely to remain a part of our fast-paced society. Although stress can't be completely _ , methods of dealing with stress-related issues, in my view, can be developed so that the effects of stress on the body are avoided, so people won't be so easy to suffer stress-related illness.

{"answer": 0, "choices": ["By studying Allan Hills meteorite.", "By using spacecraft orbiting Mars.", "By studying minerals gathered on Mars", "By studying a meteorite on the Martian surface."], "question": "Mars Was Not Always Bitterly Cold Scientists at the California Institute of Technology (Caltech) have reported evidence that Mars was warmer and wetter long ago than it is today.  The Caltech scientists say they have directly _ the temperature of Mars four billion years ago. At least, they established the surface temperature on part of the planet at that time. The researchers say it is the first such evidence to be discovered and presented. The Caltech scientists say carbonate  minerals formed on Mars at about eighteen degrees Celsius. They reached the finding after studying a meteorite  that had its beginnings near the Martian surface. Today, the average temperature on Mars is sixty-three degrees below zero Celsius. The finding was reported on the website of the National Academy of Sciences. Caltech Assistant Professor Woody Fischer helped to prepare the report. He says eighteen degrees Celsius is not especially cold or hot. He says this makes the finding extremely interesting. Knowing the temperature can give scientists an idea of the climate on Mars long ago. It can also help them decide whether the planet had liquid water. Spacecraft orbiting Mars have shown what appear to be rivers, lakebeds and mineral deposits. These pictures suggest that, at one time, water did flow there. Mars Rover vehicles and other spacecraft have confirmed the information. Caltech Geology Professor John Eiler was another writer of the report.

Contrary to what many people imagine, it has nothing to do with blindfolds. It involves tasting a wine without seeing the label and it can deliver shocking surprises. I tasted seven champagnes   blind with a group of professionals recently. There was a shock when they discovered the wine most of them preferred carried a label they regarded as their least favorite. That sort of result is especially common with champagne, the most image-driven rather than quality-driven wine of all. But it happens all the time when wine is tasted blind. Because I'm interested in how wines really taste instead of how I think they should, I taste wine blind as often as I can, especially when assessing similar young wines. But blind tasting when you know absolutely nothing about the wine in front of you is something completely different. The most difficult Master of Wine exams include three sessions during which you have a dozen glasses in front of you and nothing more helpful than a printed exam paper asking you to identify each wine as closely as possible, and assess its quality. Now that the MW is behind me, I taste wine completely blind only very rarely, and never in public. So my blind tastings these days are round the dinner table with good friends and once a year when I act as a judge, with Hugh Johnson, in the Oxford vs Cambridge wine-tasting competition.

But this was not always so. In the past, women all over the world had to fight to get the same chance as men in education and jobs. Many people said that women should not receive much education because they would not do as well as men when they went to work. One woman who showed that women should have the same chance was Marie, a scientist. In the 1800s scientists knew that a metal, uranium, gave off radiation. They also knew how much radiation came from his element. But they didn't know what this radiation was like; they wondered why and how uranium gave off radiation. Marie Curie set out to answer these questions. In one of her experiments she was studying a certain material which, she knew, contained uranium, But it gave off 4 times as much radiation as usually does. What could explain this fact? Marie Curie thought that there must be another source of radiation in this material. In 1898 Marie Curie set out to find out this new source of radiation, which she named \"radium\". Her husband, who was also a scientist, helped her. They set up a laboratory in an old building behind a school. For four years Curies searched, doing many experiments, And one morning in 1902 Marie found the source of the radiation. Marie Curie proved to the world that there was element that gave off radiation. And she also proved to the world that, if women are given truly equal chance, they can really help society.

Researchers found that walking around with a forced smile and faking happiness simply led to people feeling gloomier. So, putting a brave face on your woes could actually be counterproductive.    The research found that women suffered more than men when pretending to be happy. Psychologist, Dr. Brent Scott, who led the study, said employers should take note because forcing workers to smile when workers were dealing with clients could backfire  . He said:\"Smiling for the sake of smiling can lead to emotional exhaustion, and that's bad for the organization.\"    Dr. Scott said the research showed customer service workers who\"faked smiles\"throughout a day worsened their moods and then withdrew from work, so their productivity dropped. He added:\"Bosses may think that getting their staff to smile is good for the organization, but that's not necessarily the case.\"Dr. Scott, assistant professor of management at Michigan State University, analyzed a group of bus drivers during a two -week period.    The study is one of the first of its kind to examine emotional displays over a period of time and compare the different effects that they have on men and women. His team examined the effects of\"surface acting\"--or fake smiling--compared to what was termed\"deep acting\", or cultivating positive emotions by recalling pleasant memories. Dr. Scott said: \"Women were harmed more by'surface acting', meaning their moods worsened even more than men and they withdrew more from work. However , they were helped more by'deep acting',which meant their moods improved more.\" Dr. Scott suggested women tended to suffer more when pretending to be happy because they were expected to be more emotionally expressive than men. Therefore, faking a smile while they are feeling down is more likely to go against their normal behavior and cause more harmful feelings. Although,\"deep acting\"seemed to improve moods in the short term, Dr. Scott said it was not a long-term solution to feeling unhappy.

{"answer": 3, "choices": ["They can get more chances to gain a good job.", "They can get more financial aid.", "They have nothing to lose.", "They have less to lose and more to gain."], "question": "For the most part, it seems, workers in rich countries have little to fear from globalization, and a lot to gain. But is the same thing true for workers in poor countries? The answer is that they are even more likely than their rich-country counterparts   to benefit, because they have less to lose and more to gain.  Traditional economics takes an optimistic line on integration   and the developing countries. Openness to foreign trade and investment should encourage capital to flow to poor economies. In the developing world, capital is scarce, so the returns on investment there should be higher than in the industrialized countries, where the best opportunities to make money by adding capital to labour have already been used up. If poor countries lower their barriers to trade and investment, the theory goes, rich foreigners will want to send over some of their capital.  If this inflow of resources arrives in the form of loans or portfolio investment  , it will top up domestic savings and loosen the financial restriction on additional investment by local companies. If it arrives in the form of new foreign-controlled operations, FDI, so much the better: this kind of capital brings technology and skills from abroad packaged along with it, with less financial risk as well. In either case, the addition to investment ought to push incomes up, partly by raising the demand for labour and partly by making labour more productive. This is why workers in FDI-receiving countries should be in an even better position to profit from integration than workers in FDI-sending countries. Also, with or without inflows of foreign capital, the same gains from trade should apply in developing countries as in rich ones. This gains from trade logic often arouses suspicion, because the benefits seem to come from nowhere. Surely one side or the other must lose. Not so. The benefits that a rich country gets through trade do not come at the expense of its poor country trading partners, or vice versa. Recall that according to the theory, trade is a positive sum game. In all these trades, both sides--exporters and importers, borrowers and lenders, shareholders and workers can gain.

More than two thousand years ago the ancient Greek philosopher Aristotle defined   jokes as the pleasure that results from a feeling of triumph by showing we're better than someone else in a certain way. According to Aristotle and many other philosophers, all jokes depend mainly on showing inferiority in another person or group of persons--that is, putting it clearly, on showing that they are worse off than ourselves. Jokes raise our good opinion of ourselves at someone else's expense. Showing how much better than other people we are is only one reason we like jokes. Someone may also use a joke to express their anger or their cruelty or any other kind of action that is not acceptable to us. We feel free to laugh when we hear about someone sliding on a banana skin. The joke lets us express those attitudes which are usually unacceptable to society. This is probably the reason why some of the jokes, especially those involving cruelty, are so popular with certain people. Besides, all jokes depend on our enjoyment of laughing at something that is strange and out of place because it's different from things which are happening around it. The same situation can be either sad or pleasant, depending entirely on how strange and out of place it is. If a girl in a bathing suit falls into a swimming pool, we don't laugh because nothing unusual has happened. But if a man in a smart suit falls in, the situation is at once unusual in a pleasant way and we laugh.

If the movie is based on a book, discuss whether one is better than the other and why. If the movie is a remake, compare the film to its original.

In 1848, the Carnegies arrived in Pittsburgh, then the iron-manufacturing center of the country.

He devoted himself to the replacement of wooden bridges with stronger iron ones and earned a fortune. He further introduced a new technique to change iron into steel. By 1900, Carnegie Steel produced more of the metal than all of Great Britain. However, Carnegie often expressed his uneasiness with the businessman's life.

In fact sharks come in all shapes, sizes and even colors! Follow me please; I'd like to show you a very special small shark commonly known as horn sharks, only found in the coastal waters of north-west North America. Look at this shark, and you can easily see the horns on it and you will know the reason why it is called the horn shark is that it has the broad, flattened head and two large horn-like spines  found behind its eyes and makes it one of the hardiest of all shark species. What makes it unique is that as its enemy attempts to swallow it, the spines on its back will stick into the enemy's mouth and give a good chance for it to get away. The horn shark is brown in color with black spots all over its body. The adults can reach up to a length of 4 feet and weigh up to 10 kg. An interesting fact about the horn shark is that it has five gills . The horn shark is a clumsy swimmer using its flexible pectoral fins to push itself along the bottom of the ocean. The maximum distance that has ever been recorded for a horn shark to have traveled out from its habitat is 10 miles. Today, as so little is known about its population off the Californian coast, they have been listed as being \"Data Deficient\" in the World Conservation Union.

What do birds have to do with high speed trains? These may sound like strange things to put together. But scientists, inventors, and designers are doing just that. They are learning from nature to create new technology. The word biomimicry   combines two words: biology and mimicry. So people using biomimicry try to use examples in nature to design new technology. Biomimicry is not a new idea. People have been studying nature for hundreds of years. Leonardo DaVinci used birds as models to invent his flying machine. And when the Wright Brothers made the first successful airplane, they also studied birds. In 998, Janine Benyus, a natural science writer and teacher, wrote a book about biomimicry. To develop her interest in the subject, Janine Benyus started the Biomimicry Institute. The Biomimicry Institute is a non-profit organization. It brings together scientists, designers, inventors and many other people. It offers classes to teach people biomimicry. It provides money for people to research and test new technologies. And it wants all people, from children to adults, to think about new ways to learn from nature. People involved with the Biomimicry Institute believe that biomimicry can help solve many of the world's problems. Often, new technologies can harm nature, but this is not true for biomimicry. Let's look at some examples. Butterflies have colorful wings because light shines off them in a special way. Scientists want to copy these same ways to make light shine off computers. They hope this will make for more colorful screens. Another example of biomimicry is the bullet train. It travels at speeds of over 250 kilometers per hour! But it had a problem: it made too much noise! Through the observation of birds, scientists thought about a kind of bird, the kingfisher . The kingfisher can dive into water without making any noise because of the shape of its beak .

Among these people was a man named Alfred Butts. He always had an interest in word games and so, to fill his time, he planned a game which he called 'Lexico'. However, he was not completely satisfied with the game, so he made a number of changes to it and, in time, changed its name from 'Lexico' to 'Alph' and then to 'Criss Cross'. He wanted to make some money from his new game but he didn't have any real commercial success. In 1939, Butts happened to meet a man called Jim Brunot who showed an interest in the new game.

In the first year it sold just 2,250 sets and by 1951 it had only reached 8,500 sets a year.

Allen ran for his mini-bus. Too late; they were upon him. Just as he jumped aboard, half a dozen red spots showed on his arm, and he felt more on his back and shoulders.

However, what he didn't know was that the first sting had turned his body into a time bomb waiting for the next to set off an explosion.

Wolfgang's older sister Maria Anna (who the family called Nannerl) was learning the clavier, an early keyboard instrument, when her three-year-old brother took an interest in playing. As Nannerl later recalled, Wolfgang \"often spent much time at the clavier picking out thirds  , which he was always striking, and his pleasure showed that it sounded good.\" Their father Leopold, an assistant concertmaster at the Salzburg Court, recognized his children's unique gifts and soon devoted himself to their musical education. Born in Salzburg, Austria, on January 27, 1756, Wolfgang had composed his first original work by age five. Leopold planned to take Nannerl and Wolfgang on tour to play before the European courts. Their first venture was to nearby Munich where the children played for Maximillian III Joseph, elector of Bavaria. Leopold soon set his sights on the capital of the Hapsburg Empire, Vienna. On their way to Vienna, the family stopped in Linz, where Wolfgang gave his first public concert.

This finding suggests that taking steps to prevent northern forest fires to limit the release of greenhouse gases may warm the climate in northern regions. Usually large fires destroyed forests in these areas over the past decade. Scientists predict that with climate warming, fires may occur more frequently over the next several centuries as a result of a longer fire season. Sunlight taken in by the earth tends to cause warming, while heat mirrored back into space tends to cause cooling. This is the first study to analyze all aspects of how northern fires influence climate. Earlier studies by other scientists have suggested that fire in northern regions speed up climate warming because greenhouse gases from burning trees and plants are released into the atmosphere and thus trap heat. Scientists found that right after the fire, large amounts of greenhouse gases entered the atmosphere and caused warming. Ozone  levels increased, and ash from the fire fell on far-off sea ice, darkening the surface and causing more radiation from the sun to be taken in. The following spring, however, the land within the area of the fire was brighter than before the fire, because fewer trees covered the ground. Snow on the ground mirrored more sunlight back into space, leading to cooling. \"We need to find out all possible ways to reduce the growth of greenhouse gases in the atmosphere.\" Scientists tracked the change in the amount of radiation entering and leaving the climate system as a result of the fire, and found a measurement closely related to the global air temperature.

Oxford said Mr Blavatnik's donation was one of the most generous in the university' s 900 year history The university itself will be investing an additionalPS26m in the school, as well as land in the Radcliffe Observatory Quarter, where the school will be located. Lord Patten, Oxford's chancellor, said: \"This is a once - in - a - century opportunity for Oxford through the Blavatnik donation, Oxford will now become the world's leading centre for the training of future leaders in government and public policy - and in ways that take proper account of the very different additions, institutions and cultures that those leaders will serve.It is an important moment for the future good government throughout the world.\" Which of the following is true of the school?", "subject": ""}

{"answer": 3, "choices": ["personal taste", "our aesthetics", "cultural effects", "psychological effects"], "question": "Most of the time, we choose colors for decorating based on our personal taste and our sense of aesthetics  . But, a number of color experts believe that colors have an effect on our emotions and that it would be wise of us to be conscious of that before settling on a definite choice. Some of the effects of colors are well known and accepted by most people. In fact, those effects have been the subject of serious research and experiments and have been scientifically proven. But not all scientists agree on the validity   of the results. When we become interested in the psychological effects of colors, it is important to know that not all societies share our opinion of those effects on our emotions. What we hold as an \"objective\" observation on a color is often nothing more than a reflection of our cultural belongingness, which has attributed properties to that color for generations. Why is it not possible for us to hold a really objective discourse on the subject? In part, because it is very difficult to separate the psychological from the symbolic, the symbolic aspects are definitely cultural. Often, and this without our realizing it, they influence our understanding of colors and the following emotions - both psychological aspects. Black and white are good examples. In western countries, black is considered serious, dramatic and sometimes sad. People are warned against its potentially depressing effects on decoration. Black is the traditional color of mourning. White, on the other hand, is associated with purity, peace and optimism. For those reasons, white is the traditional color of bridal dresses. No one would think of attending a funeral in white. Any more than it would occur to a bride to wear black. We simply remain convinced that it is not in the \"nature\" of those colors. Yet, in certain oriental countries, it is white, not black that is the color of mourning. That having been said, there is some \"overlapping\" in the properties different cultures attribute to certain colors. For example, Feng Shui, the traditional Chinese philosophy that distinguishes between good and evil influences explains colors much in the same way as the majority of western color specialists. Is that to say that colors have real natural properties which all humans perceive  in the same way or is the phenomenon an example of the cross-influences that affect the thinking of cultures brought closer to one another by a certain Venetian  called Marco Polo?

They can be minor problems or life-threatening emergencies. Distinguishing a minor burn from a more serious burn involves determining the degree of damage to the tissues of the body.

The skin is usually red and some swelling   and pain may occur. Unless the burn involves large portions of the body, it can be treated at home. Second-degree burns are those in which the first layer of skin has been burned through and the second layer of skin is also burned. In these burns, the skin reddens intensely and blisters   develop. Severe pain and swelling also occur. Second-degree burns require medical treatment. Third-degree burns are the most serious and involve all layers of skin. Fat, nerves, muscles, and even bones may be affected. Areas may be charred black or appear a dry white. If nerve damage is substantial, there may be no pain at all. These burns require emergency medical attention. Follow these steps when treating minor burns at home  1) If the skin is not broken, run cool water over the burn for several minutes. 2) Cover the burn with a sterile   bandage or clean cloth. 3) Take aspirin to relieve any swelling or pain.

If you became a PhD in English or history or political science or languages or - worst of all - in philosophy , you take the risk of becoming over - educated for our national demands. Thousands of PhDs are selling shoes, driving taxis, waiting on tables and filling out applications month after month, and then may be taking a job in some high school or college with the pay much less than a door-keeper makes.

Originally discovered in Ethiopia, coffee beans were brought into the Middle East by Arab traders, spreading to Egypt, Yemen, Persia, Turkey, and North Africa by the 15th century. Muslim merchants eventually brought the beans to the thriving port city of Venice, where they sold them to wealthy Italian buyers. Soon, the Dutch began importing and growing coffee in places like Java and Ceylon (largely through slave labor), and the British East India Trading Company was popularizing the beverage in England. Coffee spread across Europe and even reached America. Where there has been coffee, there has been the coffeehouse. From the 15th century Middle Eastern establishments where men gathered to listen to music, play chess, and hear recitations from works of literature, to Paris' Cafe le Procope where luminaries of the French Enlightenment such as Voltaire, Rousseau, and Diderot came to enjoy a hot cup of joe, coffeehouses have traditionally served as centers of social interaction, places where people can come to relax, chat, and exchange ideas. The modern coffee shop is modeled on the espresso and pastry-centered Italian coffeehouses that arose with the establishment of Italian-American immigrant communities in major US cities such as New York City's Little Italy and Greenwich Village, Boston's North End, and San Francisco's North Beach. New York coffee shops were often frequented by the Beats in the 1950's. It wasn't long before Seattle and other parts of the Pacific Northwest were developing coffee shops as part of a thriving counterculture scene. The Seattle-based Starbucks took this model and brought it into mainstream culture. Although coffeehouses today continue to serve their traditional purpose as lively social hubs in many communities, they have noticeably adapted to the times.

It has become extremely common to see someone sitting at a Starbucks listening to music or surfing the web on his or her laptop.

The wonderful fighting and the world-saving adventures are much more colourful than most people's everyday lives. Well, Cody Banks is just like any other boy, except that he is not just dreaming. He has a big secret his friends never know about. He was trained to be a spy  by a special CIA programme, which was made to look like a summer camp. He learned high-speed driving, hand-to-hand fighting and the use of high-tech tools. After proving he could become a young hero by saving a baby from a runaway car, Banks gets his first real task. He must make friends with a popular girl at school, Natalie Connors. Then, he must spy on her father, a scientist who has developed a dangerous technology . Banks must stop a group of bad people from forcing Natalie's father into using the technology to endanger the world. The CIA may have taught him first-class self-defence moves, but they didn't show him how to talk to girls. Banks has zero ability when it comes to dealing with girls.

As a general rule, there is a positive relationship between the size of an animal and its flight distance --- the larger the animal, the greater the distance it must keep between itself and the enemy. An antelope will escape when the enemy is as much as five hundred yards away. The wall lizard's flight distance, on the other hand, is about six feet. Flight is the basic means of survival for mobile creatures. Critical Distance Critical distance apparently is present wherever and whenever there is a flight reaction. \"Critical distance\" includes the narrow zone separating flight distance from attack distance. A lion in a zoo will flee from an approaching man until it meets a barrier that it cannot overcome. If the man continues the approach, he soon penetrates(,)the lion's critical distance, at which point the cornered lion turns back and begins slowly stalk the man. Social Distance Social animals need to stay in touch with each other. Loss of contact with the group can be fatal  for a variety of reasons including exposure to enemies. Social distance is not simply the distance at which an animal will lose contact with his group --- that is, the distance at which it can no longer see, hear, or smell the group --- it is rather a psychological distance, one at which the animal apparently begins to feel anxious when it goes beyond its limits. We can think of it as a hidden band that contains the group. Social distance varies from species to species. It is quite short --- apparently only a few yards --- among some animals, and quite long among others. Social distance is not always rigidly fixed but is determined in part by the situation. When the young of apes and humans are mobile but not yet under control of the mother's voice, social distance may be the length of her reach. This is readily observed among baboons in a zoo. When the baby approaches a certain point, the mother reaches out to seize the end of its tail and pull it back to her. When added control is needed because of danger, social distance shortens.

But have you ever wondered why those things make you uncomfortable? It's all about personal peace, which means not only an imaginary space around the body, but also the space around all the senses. People feel that their space is being violated   when they meet with an unwelcome sound, smell or look. This is probably why a man on a crowded bus shouting into his mobile phone or a woman next to you putting on strong perfume   makes you feel angry. Whether people have had a stronger wish to protect their personal space in recent times is hard to say. Yet studies of airlines show that people have a strong desire   to have space to themselves. In a survey  by Trip Advisor, a travel website, people said that if they had to pay more for some extra service, they would rather have larger seats than extra food. Although people may need their personal space, some hardly realize it. For example, people on a bus who hold newspapers in front of their faces to read in fact keep a distance from strangers. Go and watch a library table. You will notice that one of the corner seats will usually be taken first, because they are the farthest way. What if someone sits opposite to you? Maybe you will pile up books as if to make a wall. Preference  for personal space are different from culture to culture.

Lifton's Medis Technologies, as well as companies like Hydrogenics and Nanosys, is tapping into fuel cells and dolor panels to give people power whenever and wherever they want it, free from dependence on local grids . The search for alternative energy is nothing new, but the current trend of innovators is focusing on the goal of making clean and sustainable power a mainstream commodity. For example, the fuel cell, which produces electricity from the chemical reaction between oxygen and hydrogen, has been around for about 150 years, though its commercial development did not begin until the 1960s and then only as part of NASA spacecraft. Today this technology is coming down to Earth in places like Tokyo; in nine European cities, from Stockholm to Porto, each operating three hydrogen-fuel-cell buses; and in Iceland, which is trying to create the first fuel free hydrogen economy by 2030.

Grain was the first domesticated crop that started that farming process. The oldest proven records of brewing are about 6,000 years old and refer to the Sumerians. Sumeria lay between the Tigris and Euphrates rivers including Southern Mesopotamia. It is said that the Sumerians discovered the fermentation   process by chance. No one knows today exactly how this occurred, but it could be that a piece of bread or grain became wet and a short time later, it began to ferment. The Sumerians were able to repeat this process and are assumed to be the first civilized culture to brew beer. They had discovered a \"divine drink\" which certainly was a gift from the gods. The word beer comes from the Latin word bibere, meaning \"to drink\", and the Spanish word cerveza originates from the Greek goddess of agriculture, Ceres. A vitamin-rich porridge, used daily, beer is reported to have increased health and longevity and reduced disease and malnutrition  . The self-medicating properties of alcohol-rich beer also eased the tensions and stresses of daily living in a hostile world. The use of yeast   was not yet known at that time. The success of the fermentation process was left to chance, as the brewers unknowingly relied on yeast particles in the air. Considerable scientific research took place in breweries   in the 19th century. A famous work from 1876 by Louis Pasteur was Studies Concerning Beer where he revealed his knowledge of micro-organisms. By establishing that yeast is a living microorganism, Pasteur opened the gates for accurately controlling the conversion   of sugar to alcohol. Another discovery in beer brewing was the work of Christian Hansen, a Danish scientist, who successfully isolated a single yeast cell and induced it to reproduce on an artificial culture medium. With the resulting yeast multiplication   methods, the purity of the fermenting process has been improved. According to the passage, who was the first to brew beer?", "subject": ""}

New traffic regulations are the latest measure to improve road safety, which has become a problem in China. Experts say that to achieve better road safety, various and comprehensive methods are needed. Updating the rules are only part of the story. According to the WHO (World Health Organization), traffic accidents kill more people around the world than malaria and are the leading cause of death for young people aged 5 to 29 -- especially in developing countries. Each year up to 1.3 million people are killed and more than 50 million injured in traffic accidents around the world. The economic consequences are also significant: according to a study by the World Bank and Harvard University, traffic accidents on average cost a country 1 to 3 percent of its annual Gross National Product.. The newly revised regulations impose much heavier punishment on drivers who violate traffic rules. Under the new regulations, 52 different violations result in penalties, up from 38 under the previous system. Eleven kinds of violations now result in the deduction of 12 points, compared to six points under the previous regulation. These violations include drunken driving and using fake license plates, as well as driving without a valid license.

It is also assumed that dull people are particularly suited for dull work . We are told that the reason the present-day young complain so loudly about the dullness of jobs is that they are better educated and brighter than the young of the past . Actually , there is no evidence that people who achieve a lot desire , let alone live , colorful lives . The opposite is nearer the truth . Einstein worked out his theory of relativity while serving as a clerk in a Swiss patent office . Immanuel Kant's daily life was a dull routine . The housewives of Konigsberg set their clocks when they saw him pass , on his way to the university . He took the same walk each morning , rain or shine . The greatest distance Kant ever traveled was sixty miles from Konigsberg . It may be true that work on the assembly line dulls the abilities and empties the mind , and the cure is only fewer hours of work at higher pay . But during fifty years as a workingman , I have found dull routine coexisting with an active mind . While doing dull , repetitive work by the water , I could talk with my partners and compose sentences in my mind , all at the same time . Chances are that had my work been too interesting I could not have done any thinking and composing at work or even on my own time after returning from work . People who find dull jobs unbearable are often dull people who do not know what to do with themselves at leisure . Children and mature people will get used to dull routine , while the adolescent , who has lost the child's ability for concentration and is without the inner resources of the mature , needs excitement and novelty to get rid of boredom .

The whisper of intelligence is always there, whatever you do.

We are so busy with the outside world and its force that the world that is inside us does not command that respect and reverence  , that care and concern from us.

Below we cleared up the main _ about one of the world's most perfectly formed creatures ...          All sharks are the same.           This is  ly not true. There are nearly four hundred species of sharks and they vary widely in habitat, size, features, diet and lifestyle. They range from the cigar shark, which is about 15 centimetres long, to the whale shark, which can be up to about nine meters long. More than 50 percent of sharks are less than a metre long and more than 90 percent are less than two metres long. And their habitat ranges from shallow to deep water and from the Arctic to the Tropic.           _           This is not true, either. In fact, many shark populations are decreasing. The chief reason for this is that hundreds of thousands of them are caught in fishing nets. Depending on where they are caught. They are either killed for their fins , which are used in shark's fin soup, or they are tossed back into the sea because they are unwanted. Almost all sharks which are discarded in this way die. Also, sharks mature late in life and produce very few young. If the current reduction in numbers continues, the ecological balance of the oceans will be severely threatened.

You shouldn't be! Below we cleared up the main _ about one of the world's most perfectly formed creatures ...          All sharks are the same.           This is  ly not true. There are nearly four hundred species of sharks and they vary widely in habitat, size, features, diet and lifestyle. They range from the cigar shark, which is about 15 centimetres long, to the whale shark, which can be up to about nine meters long. More than 50 percent of sharks are less than a metre long and more than 90 percent are less than two metres long. And their habitat ranges from shallow to deep water and from the Arctic to the Tropic.           _           This is not true, either. In fact, many shark populations are decreasing. The chief reason for this is that hundreds of thousands of them are caught in fishing nets. Depending on where they are caught. They are either killed for their fins , which are used in shark's fin soup, or they are tossed back into the sea because they are unwanted. Almost all sharks which are discarded in this way die. Also, sharks mature late in life and produce very few young. If the current reduction in numbers continues, the ecological balance of the oceans will be severely threatened.

{"answer": 3, "choices": ["To discover people's willingness for orders from leaders.", "To display the power of punishment on ability to learn.", "To test people's willingness to sacrifice for science.", "To explore the biological basis of social behavior."], "question": "A few years ago, in one experiment in behavioural psychology, Stanley Milgram of Yale University tested 40 subjects for their willingness to obey instructions given by a \"leader\" in a situation in which the subjects might feel a personal dislike of the actions they were called upon to perform. Specifically, Milgram told each volunteer \"teacher-subject\" that the experiment was in the noble cause of education, and was designed to test whether or not punishing pupils for their mistakes would have a positive effect on the pupils' ability to learn. The teacher-subjects were placed before a panel of thirty switches with labels ranging from \"15 volts of electricity (slight shock)\" to \"450 volts (danger -- severe shock)\" in steps of 15 volts each. The teacher-subject was told that whenever the pupil gave the wrong answer to a question, a shock was to be administered. The supposed \"pupil\" was in reality an actor hired by Milgram to pretend to receive the shocks by giving out cries and screams. Milgram told the teacher-subject to ignore the reactions of the pupil, and to administer whatever level of shock was called for. As the experiment unfolded, the \"pupil\" would deliberately give the wrong answers to questions, thereby bringing on various electrical punishments, even up to the danger level of 300 volts and beyond. Many of the teacher-subjects _ administering the higher levels of punishment, and turned to Milgram. In these situations, Milgram calmly explained that the teacher-subject was to carry on with the experiment and that it was important for the sake of the experiment that the procedure be followed through to the end. What Milgram was trying to discover was the number of teacher-subjects who would be willing to administer the highest levels of shock, even in the face of strong personal and moral revulsion  against the rules and conditions of the experiment. Before carrying out the experiment, Milgram explained his idea to a group of 39 psychiatrists and asked them to predict the average percentage of people who would be willing to administer the highest shock level of 450 volts. The overwhelming consensus was that basically all the teacher-subjects would refuse to obey the experimenter. The psychiatrists felt that \"most subjects would not go beyond 150 volts\" and only a small percentage of about one in 1,000 would give the highest shock of 450 volts. What were the actual results? Well, over 60 per cent of the teacher-subjects continued to obey Milgram up to the 450-volt limit! In repetitions of the experiment in other countries, the percentage was even higher, reaching 85 per cent in one country. How can we possibly account for this result? One might firstly argue that there must be some sort of built-in animal aggression instinct  that was activated by the experiment. A modem sociobiologist might even go so far as to claim that this aggressive instinct was of survival value to our ancestors in their struggle against the hardships of life on the plains and in the caves, finally finding its way into our genetic make-up. Another explanation is to see the teacher-subjects' actions as a result of the social context in which the experiment was carried out. As Milgram himself pointed out, \"Most subjects in the experiment see their behaviour in a larger context that is good and useful to society -- the pursuit of scientific troth. The psychological laboratory has a strong claim to legitimacy  and gains trust and confidence in those who perform there. An action such as shocking a victim, which in isolation  appears evil, acquires a completely different meaning when placed in this setting\". Here we have two different explanations. The problem for us is to sort out which of these two polar explanations is more reasonable.

Though injured, she completed the rescue mission   while under fire on the ground and received the Purple Heart and the Distinguished Flying Cross for \"outstanding heroism and selfless devotion to duty.\" However, Hegar did not get prizes for serving in combat  , for it is illegal for women to be in official combat  positions and to get the benefits that come with them. Hegar and three other service women filed a lawsuit  in federal court in San Fransico on Nov. 27 in a long-overdue challenge to the Pentagon's   ban. Many military women who _ 14% of the 1.4 million active members of the military object to the policy because it stops them from applying for some 238,000 jobs and excludes   them from certain promotions. It is particularly unfair because it doesn't protect women in service. Fully 85% of women, who have served since Sept.11, report having served in a combat zone or an area where they were faced with combat or immediate danger according to the lawsuit, and half reported being involved in combat operations. At least 860 female troops have been wounded and 144 killed in the Iraq and Afghanistan wars. The ban does another bad thing: drive talented women out of service. Hegar says she is asked to leave the Air National Guard for a Reserve Liaison position because she is excluded(,) from jobs she would like to apply for. Another woman who is suing, Captain Alexandra Zoe Bedell who was sent twice to Afghanistan, left active duty last year, because of the combat exclusion policy. It is hard to see how the Pentagon could meet this burden. Clearly, women are capable of taking challenging, dangerous combat assignment, because as the careers of Hegar and others like her have shown they are doing it now. The Pentagon's policy is based on \"outdated idea of women\", just the sort of thing the Constitution forbids. But the Pentagon should not wait for the courts to order it to treat female service members equally. There can be little doubt that a court will eventually do just that and little doubt that, in the very near future, the no-combat rule, like the racial segregation   of troops and \"Don't ask, don't tell,\" will seem like an ancient relic   of unenlightened   times.

Without knowing or being taught any programming language, I was able to figure out some of the BASIC code. I just gave myself a limitless number of lives in the game, so I could continue playing it forever. This was also my first introduction to algebra, and I didn't even know it at the time. This was a decisive moment in my life. I was quite excited because of what I was learning and what I was able to do. As a result, I was enthusiastic for the rest of my life about self-learning and computers, and I was quite happy doing them too. I've noticed that people who are truly content with life are enthusiastic about what they do. This enthusiasm, along with good health, is the key to being happy. It also leads to self-confidence and content in life too. It may also lead to success, wealth and achievements.

I know many people with successful businesses that are not happy with what they are doing .I know people who continuously buy themselves new toys , such as cars , computers ,and televisions ,yet never seem content for too long .Please remember , happiness is the journey of life , not the destination.

Judging from the teenagers who yawn in class, it does. And those students aren't just lazy. Scientific studies have shown that school does start too early for young students. According to a series of studies done across the U.S., the later classes begin, the more academic performance improves. Boys and girls naturally stay up later and sleep in later. The trend begins around age 13 or 14 and peaks between 17 and 19.The teens also need more sleep in general, so forcing them to be up early for school cuts into their sleep time as well as their sleep rhythm, making them less ready to learn during those first-period classes. Practice is proving the science. Hundreds of school districts in the U.S. have experimented with later start times and the academic performance of students has improved as a result. A study of 9,000 high school students in three states showed that grades in science, math, English and social studies all rose when school began at 8:35 or later. What's more, attendance goes up and student depression goes down. The later school starts, the better the result, too. According to a study, delaying the opening bell from 7:30 a.m. to 8:30 a.m. paid off more than delaying only until 8:00 a.m. Students who get at least eight hours of sleep, and preferably nine, perform better than those who do not, so a greater delay raises the chances of achieving those numbers. So, it turns out morning class is just too early for students to learn chemistry equations or study an ancient poem.

According to a study, delaying the opening bell from 7:30 a.m. to 8:30 a.m. paid off more than delaying only until 8:00 a.m. Students who get at least eight hours of sleep, and preferably nine, perform better than those who do not, so a greater delay raises the chances of achieving those numbers. So, it turns out morning class is just too early for students to learn chemistry equations or study an ancient poem.

Judging from the teenagers who yawn in class, it does. And those students aren't just lazy. Scientific studies have shown that school does start too early for young students. According to a series of studies done across the U.S., the later classes begin, the more academic performance improves. Boys and girls naturally stay up later and sleep in later. The trend begins around age 13 or 14 and peaks between 17 and 19.The teens also need more sleep in general, so forcing them to be up early for school cuts into their sleep time as well as their sleep rhythm, making them less ready to learn during those first-period classes. Practice is proving the science. Hundreds of school districts in the U.S. have experimented with later start times and the academic performance of students has improved as a result.

There is one located on our street and it has just been completely rebuilt. I told her that they helped people book their trips and vacations. \"Why haven't we ever been there?' she wanted to know. \"Because we do everything ourselves online these days.\" I explained. \"But why do you do it yourself if other people want to do it for you?\" she wondered out loud. The answer is that the travel agency makes a little bit of money on each ticket you book through them. If you book your ticket yourself online, you save that money. Saving money sounds great except that when you think about it you typically spend three evenings comparing prices to end up saving EUR30 on a EUR300 trip. All those EUR30 discounts add up of course so I guess we should be happy with that. Consider books for a moment. Buying your book at Amazon saves you 30% to 40% on each book. Add to that the convenience of shopping from home and getting the package delivered to your home address. So far so good. Unfortunately, that does mean you spend too much time browsing Amason.com while you could do something fun instead. Like maybe reading an actual book? Then the package arrives and you aren't home and end up having to pick it up at the local post-office. All in all I wonder how much time I end up investing in the whole process. Time sounds free, but to most of us, it is more valuable than money. The Internet Economy promised to get rid of the middle-men and we loved it. Somehow, I'm starting to get the feeling that we ourselves ended up doing the work of the middle-men we were so eager to get rid of. In any project you can always pick two of these: fast, cheap or good. We seem to have focused a lot on \"cheap\" and \"good\" but the extra time we need to invest to also keep it \"fast\" comes out of our own pockets. Your can always make more money, but you can never make more time. What is the best title for the passage?", "subject": ""}

{"answer": 1, "choices": ["Family genes.", "Genetic differences.", "Educational levels.", "Job positions."], "question": "Since IQ testing began a century ago, women have been as much as five points behind, leading psychologists to suggest genetic differences between the male and the female. That gap has been narrowing in recent years and this year women have moved ahead. The finding has been made by James Flynn, a world-famous expert on IQ tests. \"In the last 100 years, the IQ scores of both men and women have risen but women's have risen faster,\" said Flynn. \" This is a result of modernity. The complex modern world is making our brains adapt and raising our IQs.\" One possible explanation is that women's lives have become more demanding as they multitask between raising a family and doing a job. Another might be that women have a slightly higher potential intelligence than men and are only now realizing it. Flynn also made the great discovery that scores in western countries increased by roughly three points a decade, which means people today get 30 more points than those living 100 years ago and that IQs can be improved. Flynn conducted new IQ tests in western European countries, America, Canada, New Zealand, Argentina and Estonia, which showed that the gap between men and women had become very small. In New Zealand, Estonia and Argentina, women scored slightly higher than men. Maybe because of this, many women have exchanged the role with their husband in family life. Helena Jamieson, 33, works a full-time job and her husband, Luke, 37, is a stay-at-home father.

But in this age of BlackBerrys, recession pressures, working at home after hours and on weekends, family time may not be working out the way we thought. Busy parents who expected more time with the kids are Finding that more work hours at home don't necessarily translate into quality time with them. A new generation of parents needs to discover the meaning of \"quality time,\" researchers say. \"Personally, just given the life I lead, I think there is something to this idea of quality time- spending productive time with children vs. just being around,\" says Peter Brandon, a professor at Carleton College. He says engaging or interacting with a child in activities such as reading or playing counts as quality time rather than \"passive monitoring,\" such as washing the dishes while the child is watching TV. \" _ ,\" Brandon says. He notes that good parent-child relationships result in children being happier and more successful, including at school. As parents struggle to be more available to their kids, new research on work and family  schedules to be presented Friday at the meeting in Dallas includes a study that shows parents' availability is on the decline because more parents are in the workforce. Although parents today may be spending more time on child care, they are less available overall.

The World Meteorological   Organization (WMO) said its modeling suggested a \"fairly large potential for an El Nino, most likely by the end of the second quarter of 2016\". The El Nino phenomenon occurs every two to seven years, when the trade winds that circulate surface water in the tropical   Pacific start to weaken. WMO pointed out Tuesday that since last December, trade winds had weakened and there had been a significant warming of the waters below the surface in the central Pacific. \"While  there is no guarantee this situation will  lead to an El Nino event, the longer the trade winds remain  weakened, and subsurface temperatures stay significantly warmer than average, the higher chances are,\" it said. Two thirds of climate models predicted that the phenomenon would begin sometime between June and August, with one-fifth suggesting it could start as early as May, and the remaining predicting no El Nino this year, it said. It is often followed by a return swing of La Nina, which is characterized by unusually cool ocean surface temperatures in the central and eastern tropical Pacific. \"El Nino has an important warming effect on global average temperatures,\" Jarraud cautioned, stressing that combined with warming from greenhouse gases such events had \"the potential to cause a sharp rise in global average temperature\".

So the result is that most of us know that we are going to make mistakes, but deep down, we feel we shouldn't. Experiments with schoolchildren who did well on a given test show that those who were praised for being smart and then offered a more challenging or less challenging task afterward usually chose the easier one. On the other hand, children praised for trying hard-rather than being smart-far more often selected the more difficult task. If we try hard to avoid mistakes, we aren't open to getting the information we need in order to do better. In a writing study, experiments showed that those who are so scared to make mistakes perform worse in writing tasks than those who aren't as worried about being perfect. They fear receiving any kind of negative feedback, so they don't learn where they went wrong and how to get better. We don't just learn more when we're open to mistakes, we learn deeper. Research tells us that if we're only concerned about getting the right answer, we don't always learn the underlying concepts that help us truly understand whatever we're trying to figure out.

Causal reasoning may go from cause to effect or from effect to cause.Either way, we reason from what we know to what we want to find out.Sometimes we reason from an effect to a cause and then on to another effect.Thus, if we reason that because the lights have gone out, the refrigerator won't work, we first relate the effect (lights out) to the cause (power off) and then relate that cause to another effect (refrigerator not working).This kind of reasoning is called, for short, effect to effect.It is quite common to reason through an extensive chain of causal relations.When the lights go out we might reason in the following causal chain: lights out--power off--refrigerator not working--temperature will rise--milk will sour.In other words, we diagnose a succession of effects from the power failure, each becoming the cause of the next. Causes are classified as necessary, sufficient, or contributory.A necessary cause is one which must be present for the effect to occur, as combustion  is necessary to drive a gasoline engine.A sufficient cause is one which can produce an effect unaided, though there may be more than one sufficient cause; a dead battery is enough to keep a car from starting, but faulty spark plugs or an empty gas tank will have the same effect.A contributory cause is one which helps to produce an effect but cannot do so by itself, as running through a red light may help cause an accident, though other factors -- pedestrians or other cars at the crossroads -- must also be present. In establishing or refuting  a causal relation it is usually necessary to show the process by which the alleged   cause produces the effect.Such an explanation is called a causal process.

The devices work like this-A driver must blow into a blood alcohol device linked to the car's ignition. If the result is higher than the legal limit, the car will not start. The device also requires random \"rolling retests\" once the driver is on the road. Virginia's current law requires only repeat drunken-driving offenders or those with a blood alcohol level of 0.15 or higher to have an ignition interlock device in their car. The new law, which takes effect in July, will roughly increase the number of people required to use ignition interlock devices four times, and offenders will have to pay about $ 480 for a typical six-month installation. The measure has caused a debate between groups battling drunken driving and those representing offenders.

Ignition interlock devices, they say, reduce repeat offenses.

In addition, several writers sent me unpublished translations of their novels, giving me a rare opportunity to read works otherwise unavailable to the 62% of the British who only speak English.

This is where things start getting difficult.Lots of people are doing the same thing.And the winner of the \"handathon\" contest is the person who can carry on doing it for the longest time.That person gets to own the car. It still seems to be an easy thing to do.At the beginning it is.Anyone can stand still.But when the contest has been going for four or five days,standing still seems like the most difficult job in the world.And keeping the hand in place over this time becomes an act of serious attention.After a few days,the hand seems to belong to someone else--someone who wants to go home and get some sleep.

{"answer": 2, "choices": ["His date of birth.", "His marriage.", "His life in the Grammar School.", "His date of death."], "question": "Shakespeare, more perhaps than any other writer, made full use of the greatest resources of the English language. Most of us use about five thousand words in our normal use of English; Shakespeare in his works used about twenty-five thousand words! There is probably no better way for a foreigner to appreciate the richness and variety of the English language than by studying the various ways in which Shakespeare uses it. Such a study is well worth the effort, even though some aspects of English usage, and the meaning of many words, have changed since Shakespeare's day. However, it is surprising that we should know comparatively little about the life of the greatest English writer. We know that Shakespeare was born in 1564 in Stratford-on-Avon, and that he died there in 1616. He almost certainly attended the Grammar School in the town, but of this we cannot be sure. We know he was married there in 1582 to Anne Hathaway and that he had three children. We know that he spent much of his life in London writing his great works. But this is almost all that we do know. However, what is important about Shakespeare's life is not its other less important details but its products, the plays and the poems.

{"answer": 3, "choices": ["all high-school students take the same courses", "every student must take practical ability training courses", "every public school offers the same academic subjects", "the subjects every student takes may vary"], "question": "Education is an expensive part of American life. Its size is matched by its variety. Differences in American schools compared with those found in the majority of other countries lie in the fact that education here has long been intended for everyone. Schools are expected to meet the needs of every child, regardless of ability, and also the needs of society itself. This means that public schools offer more than academic subjects. It surprises many people when they come here to find high schools offering such courses as typing, sewing, radio repair, computer programming or driver training, along with traditional academic subjects such as mathematics, history, and languages.  Students choose their courses depending on their interests, future goals, and level of ability. The basic goal of American education is to develop every child to the utmost of his or her own possibilities, and to give each one a sense of community.

Now, a new study of PBS Kids suggests that the experience can be an educational one as well. The study, which was administered by PBS under a grant from the Department of Education, first tested the vocabulary level of a group of 90 Title 1 school children, aged 3 to 7. Then, the children were each given two weeks with an iPod Touch loaded with the Martha Speaks Dog Party app created by PBS Kids. The study monitored how the children used the iPod, during what hours, and in what context. On average, the study found that kids played with the iPod Touch for a total of 5 hours across the two weeks, with half that time spent playing the Martha Speaks app. At the end of the two week trial, the children were given another vocabulary test, which revealed an increase in vocabulary acquisition by as much as 31 per cent. The study findings are particularly useful as smart phones and mobile devices have become increasingly popular among families and parents are faced with a proliferation of mobile apps designed for kids. According to a recent Nielsen study, smart phone usage is 12% higher in households with children than other households. \"Mobile apps can be a great learning tool in the hands of children,\" said Lesli Rotenberg, SVP, Children's Media, PBS. \"This research is important in helping to better understand and guide the development of new apps that improve the value of children's screen time with significant educational outcomes.\" So what does it all mean? At best, it provides more evidence that mobile devices and apps do indeed have educational value and could be an important part of the child-learning process for many years to come.

But the earth goes through temperature cycles over much longer periods than those that we experience. Between 65,000 and 35,000 years ago, the planet was much colder than it is now. During that time the temperature also changed a lot, with periods of warming and cooling. Ice melted during the warm periods, which made sea levels rise. Water froze again during the cold periods.

It now seems that the ice melted at both ends of the earth, rather than just in either northern or southern regions. This surprised the researchers from the University of Bern. Scientists have long assumed that most of the ice that melted was in the Northern hemisphere  during the 30,000-year long ice age. That belief was held because the North Pole is surrounded by land, while the South Pole is surrounded by the Antarctic Ocean. It is easier for ice sheets to grow on land. If surrounded by sea the ice can easily just slip into the ocean instead of building up. The researchers used a computer model to look at ways the ice could melt and how it might affect sea levels.

{"answer": 1, "choices": ["A computer model", "Studies show ice melted equally in the North and the South during the ice age", "Most of the ice melted in the Northern hemisphere during the 30,000-year long ice age.", "A survey result"], "question": "Most of us are used to seasons. Each year, spring follows winter, which follows autumn, which follows summer, which follows spring. And winter is colder than summer. But the earth goes through temperature cycles over much longer periods than those that we experience. Between 65,000 and 35,000 years ago, the planet was much colder than it is now. During that time the temperature also changed a lot, with periods of warming and cooling. Ice melted during the warm periods, which made sea levels rise. Water froze again during the cold periods. A new study from Switzerland, sheds light on where ice sheets melted during the ice age. It now seems that the ice melted at both ends of the earth, rather than just in either northern or southern regions. This surprised the researchers from the University of Bern. Scientists have long assumed that most of the ice that melted was in the Northern hemisphere  during the 30,000-year long ice age. That belief was held because the North Pole is surrounded by land, while the South Pole is surrounded by the Antarctic Ocean. It is easier for ice sheets to grow on land. If surrounded by sea the ice can easily just slip into the ocean instead of building up. The researchers used a computer model to look at ways the ice could melt and how it might affect sea levels. They compared these results to evidence of how temperatures and currents actually changed during that time. The model showed that if it was only in the Northern hemisphere that ice melted, there would have been a bigger impact  on ocean currents  and sea temperatures than what actually happened. Studies suggest that melting just in the Southern hemisphere would have been impossible, too. The only reasonable conclusion, the scientists could make, was that ice melted equally in the North and the South. It is still a mystery as to what caused the temperature changes that caused the ice to melt. Which of the following is the best title for the passage?", "subject": ""}

For instance, in the movie Star Trek, the workers could go to a replicator  and order food, drinks or anything they could program  into the computer. Before long, the item would appear. This is possible today, in a way, with technology we have had for years. Several manufacturers  have created 3D printers. One company, MakerBot, has created a printer that the average person can afford. It is called The Replicator. You can download a lot of design software from the Internet for use with The Replicator. In the near future, rather than going to a store to buy what you need, you may be able to download what you want from the Internet and print it out at home. The process was first used with music. At the very beginning, music was recorded onto plastic disks with etching . Music can now be copied without a physical product.  _  Rather than having to buy a physical book or magazine, you can now download them from the Internet in digital  form. This technology is already used in engineering and architecture. Melissa Shoes, a Brazilian footwear company, is using this technology to create shoes. Rather than having to go through the current process of product design and development, the company is able to design and print shoes for display to see how well they will sell before having lots of them made.

In high school I wanted to be an electrical engineer and, of course, any reasonable student with my aims would have chosen a college with a large engineering department, many famous professors and lots of good labs and research equipment. But that's not what I did. I chose to study engineering in a small liberal-arts  university that doesn't even offer a major in electrical engineering. Obviously, this was not a practical choice; I came here for more noble reasons. I wanted a broad education that would provide me with flexibility and a value system to guide me in my job. I wanted to open my eyes and expand my vision by communicating with people who weren't studying science or engineering. My parents, teachers and other adults praised me for such a wise choice. They told me I was wise and grown-up beyond my 18 years, and I believed them. I headed off to the college and sure I was going to have an advantage over those students who went to big engineering \"factories\" where they didn't care if you had values or were flexible. I was going to be a complete engineer: technical expert and excellent humanist all in one. Now I'm not so sure. Somewhere along the way my noble ideas crashed into reality, as all noble ideas finally do. After three years of struggling to balance math, physics and engineering courses with liberal-arts courses, I have learned there are reasons why few engineering students try to reconcile engineering with liberal-arts courses in college. The reality that has blocked my path to become the typical successful student is that engineering and the liberal arts simply don't mix as easily as I supposed in high school. Individually they shape a person in very different ways. The struggle to reconcile the two fields of study is difficult. At present, the writer is studying   _  .", "subject": ""}

I headed off to the college and sure I was going to have an advantage over those students who went to big engineering \"factories\" where they didn't care if you had values or were flexible. I was going to be a complete engineer: technical expert and excellent humanist all in one. Now I'm not so sure. Somewhere along the way my noble ideas crashed into reality, as all noble ideas finally do. After three years of struggling to balance math, physics and engineering courses with liberal-arts courses, I have learned there are reasons why few engineering students try to reconcile engineering with liberal-arts courses in college. The reality that has blocked my path to become the typical successful student is that engineering and the liberal arts simply don't mix as easily as I supposed in high school. Individually they shape a person in very different ways. The struggle to reconcile the two fields of study is difficult. What problem has the writer found in his study at college?", "subject": ""}

In high school I wanted to be an electrical engineer and, of course, any reasonable student with my aims would have chosen a college with a large engineering department, many famous professors and lots of good labs and research equipment. But that's not what I did. I chose to study engineering in a small liberal-arts  university that doesn't even offer a major in electrical engineering. Obviously, this was not a practical choice; I came here for more noble reasons. I wanted a broad education that would provide me with flexibility and a value system to guide me in my job.

Transporting the bottles and keeping them cold also burns fuels, which give off greenhouse gases. And groundwater pumping by bottled water companies draws heavily on underground aquifers  and harms watersheds , according to the Sierra Club. And some studies suggest it takes up to three liters of water to produce one liter of bottled water. Yet more than $100 billion is spent every year on bottled water globally. In many cities in developing countries where there is not a safe source of tap water, bottled water becomes a trusted choice. In the US, tap water is controlled by the government and often examined for dangerous polluted substances. Each American drinks 79 liters of bottled water per year on average, according to the Columbia Water Center at Columbia University's Earth Institute in New York. The bottled water industry is so successful that it has outpaced  milk, coffee, and juice in the number of gallons of drinks sold -- putting it behind only beer and soda. Though the sale and consumption   of bottled water is still on the rise, certain policymakers have taken steps to reduce it and encourage people to drink tap water. In September 2009, the Australian town of Bundanoon became the first town in the world to completely ban bottled water from its stores' shelves, building water fountains  around the town instead. Among US cities that have taken action are San Francisco and Seattle, which no longer buy water for city use, and Chicago, which added a five-cent tax on each bottle.

{"answer": 0, "choices": ["gun murders", "natural diseases", "TV violence", "physical punishment"], "question": "Teenage boys, regardless of race, are more likely to die from gunshot wounds than from all natural causes combined. By the time the average American child leaves primary school, he or she will witness 8,000 murders and more than 100,000 acts of violence on television.  Youth are becoming involved in violence at an alarming rate. In fact, the young arrest rate for murder doubled, from 6 arrests per 100,000 youth aged from 10 to 17 to over 12 per 100,000.  For the many youth who have not been directly exposed to violence in their own communities, the entertainment media (television, movies, music and video games) provides many opportunities for children to see and hear violent exchanges. Research shows that there are about 5~6 violent acts per hour on prime time and 20~25 violent acts on Saturday morning  children's programming. In its report, the American Psychological Association (APA) reported that viewing violence on television hurts children in many ways. In particular, the APA  concludes that children may become less sensitive to the pain and suffering of others, be more  fearful of the world around them, be more likely to behave in aggressive or harmful ways to- ward others, and gradually accept violence as a way to solve problems. Another form of violence involving youth is physical punishment in the schools. This form of discipline   still remains legally supported in 23 nations in America. The Office for Civil Rights in the Department of Education reported that 555,000 students were physically punished in the schools during this school year. Although such punishment has been regarded as an effective method of discipline by those who apply it, the findings are obvious that physical punishment does not work and that children who are victims of physical punishment are subject to potential long-term physical and emotional damage.
