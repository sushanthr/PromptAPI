I've seen so many new graduates who do not know how to use the degree they have just earned. An example was Dave, who loved sports and had played baseball throughout his college years.

Among the decorations, a bright-color1ed wool artwork attracts most eyeballs and brings about a feeling of warmth. The designer, Gu Yeli, says the art piece, Kiss Forest, was inspired by US artist Andy Warhol's 1963 experimental film Kiss, which featured various couples kissing for three and a half minutes each. Gu also organizes a small workshop to teach knitting   to children.  Artist Wang Xuejun sets up a stainless-steel mirror at the mall's gate leading to Zizhong Lu. Visitors, including men, are invited to put on lipstick and kiss the mirror, thus kissing themselves. The Beast Floral Shop, a flower shop in Shanghai, contributes two walls of flowers that are made into the shape of a book, named Kiss Book. Artifacts   of bees and butterflies are fixed among the blossoms, kissing the flowers. The work represents love and harmony in nature.  Architect Ma Ke creates a Kiss Bridge with transparent   acrylic boards and ceramic fishbowls. Bridges are often spots for dating lovers in traditional Chinese folk stories and the goldfish in the bowls are witnesses of the lovers' kisses.

In any case, what would we have gained by landing? The country was full of snakes and other dangerous creatures and the jungle was so thick that one would be able to advance slowly, cutting one's way with knives the whole way.

{"answer": 2, "choices": ["money is very important in the material world", "the purpose of our life is to make money", "money does not surely mean happiness", "we should value money in our life"], "question": "Recently a professor of philosophy in the United States has written a book called Money and the Meaning of Life. He has discovered that how we deal with money in our day to day life has more meaning than we usually think. One of the exercises he has asked his students to do is to keep a record of every penny they spend for a week. From the way they spend their money, they can see what they really value in life. The professor says our relation with others often becomes clearly defined when money enters the picture. You might have wonderful friendship with somebody and you think that you are very good friends.

{"answer": 2, "choices": ["Money is important in modern society.", "The meaning of life does not completely lie in money.", "Wealth will surely bring the owner happiness.", "Happiness is not necessarily the result of wealth."], "question": "Recently a professor of philosophy in the United States has written a book called Money and the Meaning of Life. He has discovered that how we deal with money in our day to day life has more meaning than we usually think. One of the exercises he has asked his students to do is to keep a record of every penny they spend for a week. From the way they spend their money, they can see what they really value in life. The professor says our relation with others often becomes clearly defined when money enters the picture. You might have wonderful friendship with somebody and you think that you are very good friends. But you will know him only when you ask him to lend you some money.If he does,it brings something to the relationship that seems stronger than ever before. Otherwise it can suddenly weaken the relationship if he doesn't. Since money is so important to us, we consider those who are rich to be very important.

Yet, time travel in China is a bit different from time travel in common sense.It is anything but science fiction and always goes backwards in time.There is minimum imagination involved--no ever-ending circles that mess up present and future, no advanced technology, no new social orders or new human forms from the twenty--whatever century, everything is a known historical fact when you travel through in China. It is not even called time travel; rather the Chinese people refer it as time crossover.Time crossover has been an extremely popular theme for online novels for years(in fact , it is an indispensible part of China's online culture), and didn't get picked up by TV and the big screen until recent two years.Most of time-travel dramas and movies are adapted from popular online novels and like in other cases adaptations are never better than the original books. The main plot of time-travel novels or TV dramas can be very well summarized in one sentence: from nobody to somebody.Time travel in China is more about escaping from the reality than about realizing wild dreams. In China , there is no need of time machine either.People travel backwards in time via the possession of antiques presence at historical places of interest encounter of life-threatening accidents or simple a look into the mirror.Some time-travel novels even start with \"I wanted to go back to history so much that one morning when I opened my eyes I was back.\" Technology is not relevant at all. Though China is not short of histories to go back to, people have their own preferences and it is pretty much a gender  thing.If the main character is male then he usually goes back to special times in history when he is able to help build up or tear up a dynasty.A typical example is A Step Into the Past , the first time-travel TV drama in China, which tells the story of how a SWAT member helps to unite China and build up Qin Dynasty . On the other hand , female characters primarily go back to Qing Dynasty partly because Qing Dynasty has the most number of princes to fall in love with.Yongzheng Emperor is the favorite.As can be seen in Startling by Each Step , a Qing time crossover classic, a girl goes back to Qing Dynasty and falls in love with Yongzheng Emperor and his brothers.

Iris scanning and other technologies , such as fingerprint and voice scanning , have appeared in many science fiction movies in the past. Today , these advanced technologies are part of the real world. They are common at work, the bank, the airport, and your local prison. The iris scan, fingerprint scan, and voice scan are all examples of biometrics  a fast developing area of automatic personal identification technology . Basically , biometrics uses various ways to verify a persons identity , based on the individual's unique characteristics ,including fingerprints , voices, irises, body heat patterns, facial images, handprints , signatures and so on. Biometrics identification systems have a number of advantages over password systems. The primary advantage is that an individual has to be physically present in order to be identified. Another important advantage is that there are no passwords to remember , forget, lose or steal. The voice scan is the simplest and most affordable form of biometrics . It only requires a computer, a microphone and the correct software. The software records a subject's voice and then compares it to a stored voice sample for identification purposes. For additional safety, fingerprint and handprint scans can also be employed . Fingerprint scans take the image of a fingerprint and compare it to a stored file of prints. Handprint scans identify the unique features of a hand. Iris scans currently give the highest level of accuracy among all the available biometrics systems. Another technology , full facial scans , is currently in use at border crossings and airports. Facial scanning equipment can actually track and identify moving faces within a crowd. The potential of biometrics is exciting and encouraging . With continued development , testing , and application , current technologies will become even more effective in the future.

They may talk about how the weather prevented them from having fun or how the weather supported their outdoor events. You can talk about the weather with them to begin a conversation. While talking, they always try to follow up on their answer by asking another open-ended question or make a statement, such as \"Wow, that sounds like fun ! \" or \"You went to St. Louis. In which state is that?\" Be creative in your questions. Feel free to ask one or two, but not very personal ones about relations. Stick to the facts or events that were already referred to.

I looked left, right and behind me. Nothing. Not a car, no suggestion of car lamps, but there I sat, waiting for the light to change, the only human being for at least a mile in any direction. I started wondering why I refused to run the light I was not afraid of being caught, because there was clearly no policeman around, and there certainly would have been no danger in going through it. Much later that night, the question of why I'd stopped for that light came back to me. I think I stopped because it's part of a contract we all have with each other. It's not only the law, but it is an agreement we have, and we trust each other to honor it: we don't go through red lights. Trust is our first inclination .Doubting others does not seem to be natural to us. The whole construction of our society depends on mutual trust, not distrust.

At one point along an open road, I came to a crossing with a traffic light. I was alone on the road by now, but as I drove near the light, it turned red and I made a stop. I looked left, right and behind me. Nothing. Not a car, no suggestion of car lamps, but there I sat, waiting for the light to change, the only human being for at least a mile in any direction. I started wondering why I refused to run the light I was not afraid of being caught, because there was clearly no policeman around, and there certainly would have been no danger in going through it. Much later that night, the question of why I'd stopped for that light came back to me. I think I stopped because it's part of a contract we all have with each other. It's not only the law, but it is an agreement we have, and we trust each other to honor it: we don't go through red lights. Trust is our first inclination .Doubting others does not seem to be natural to us. The whole construction of our society depends on mutual trust, not distrust.

{"answer": 2, "choices": ["enables it to survive with fewer leaves", "works in many other desert plants in the world", "helps it collect much more water than other plants", "prevents the plant from losing water and heat"], "question": "ScienceDaily (July 5, 2009) -- Researchers from the University of Haifa-Oranim have managed to make out the \"self-irrigating\" mechanism  of the desert rhubarb , which enables it to harvest 16 times the amount of water collected by other plants in the Negev Desert. This is the first example of a self-irrigating plant worldwide. The desert rhubarb grows in the mountains of Israel's Negev desert, where average rainfall is particularly low (75 mm per year). Unlike most of the other desert plant species, which have small leaves so as to reduce water loss, this plant is unique in that its leaves are particularly large; each plant's rosette  of one to four leaves reaches a total diameter  of up to one meter.  Prof. Simcha Lev-Yadun, Prof. Gidi Ne'eman and Prof. Gadi Katzir came across this unique plant while studying the field area with students of the Department of Science Education-Biology of the University of Haifa-Oranim, and noticed that its waxy leaves are unusually large. They observed an exceptionally ridged  structure on each leaf.  The scientists explained that these deep and wide depressions in the leaves create a \"channeling\" mountain-like system by which the rain water is channeled toward the ground surrounding the plant's deep root. Other desert plants simply absorb the rain water that goes through the ground in its immediate surroundings.  The desert rhubarb is able to harvest quantities of water that are 16 times the amount of water harvested by the small-leafed plants of the Negev desert region. When the research team watered the plant artificially, they observed how the water flows along the course of the leave's depressions to the ground surrounding the plant's single root and then goes through the ground to a depth of 10 cm or more.

Set in fictional San Fransokyo, the film follows Hiro, a 14-year-old robotics genius  . After his brother dies, he goes on a journey to save his city from an evil masked man with his brother's invention, Baymax. Baymax was named \"Disney's most straightforwardly adorable   character\" in years by The Telegraph. He has a pure white pear-shaped body and stumpy elephant legs. And his eyes -just two black dots with a line through them - can blink   quickly or slowly. Baymax's physical appearance \"works with his personality because he's purely good and naive  ,\" co-director Don Hall told The Hollywood Reporter. Sometimes Baymax is awkward. Moving in tight spaces gets challenging with his potbelly  . And when his batteries run low, he behaves like an amusing drunk. \"This means that he is not at all intimidating   and is easy to like,\" commented The Straits Times in Singapore. Baymax is a comforting friend, the kind that perhaps everyone needs. After he diagnoses   Hiro with feeling sorrow, he says: \"Physical comfort helps too,\" and pulls Hiro into a hug. He pats his head, saying: \"There, there.\" The team's car crashes into the water at one point, and they have to walk shivering   back home. Baymax notices that everyone's body temperatures are low, so he turns on his internal heaters. Everyone cuddles   up with him. \"This is like spooning   with a warm marshmallow  ,\" says Fred, one of the characters. One minute, he is used as a bouncy castle  , and the next he transforms into a superhero. To fight against the villain, Hiro upgrades Baymax so that the robot can attack and fly. The robot has a hard time figuring out these new skills, but after he realizes that Hiro is happy with his improvement, he immediately becomes an expert. \"The treatment is working,\"he says.

Tony Higgins from UCAS said that the statistics are good news for everyone in higher education. \"Students who take a well-planned year out are more likely to be satisfied with, and complete, their chosen course. Students who take a gap year are often more mature and responsible,\" he said. But not everyone is happy. Owain James, the president of the National Union of Students(NUS), argued that the increase is evidence of student hardship -young people are being forced into earning money before finishing their education. \"New students are now aware that they are likely to leave university with up to PS15,000 in debt. It is not surprising that more and more students are taking a gap year to earn money to support their study for the degree.

{"answer": 3, "choices": ["It is impossible for a monster to live in cold water.", "The Loch Ness Monster often stays under the water.", "The Loch Ness Monster is an air-breathing animal.", "There is no so-called monster in Loch Ness."], "question": "Loch Ness, the largest freshwater lake in the British Isles, is twenty four miles long and, at one point, one mile wide. It has an average depth of four hundred and fifty feet and at times drops close to a thousand. It is cold and murky  , with dangerous currents. In short, it is the perfect place to hide a monster from even the sharpest eyes of science. The Loch Ness Monster, also called Nessie, is supposedly living in this area. The earliest recorded sighting of the Loch Ness Monster was in the biography of Life of St. Columba by Adamnan in the year AD 565. The monster apparently attacked a man who was swimming in the River Ness. The monster didn't make headlines again until August 27, 1930, when 3 fishermen reported seeing a creature with 20 feet long approaching their boat, throwing water in the air. In 1933, after a new road was built along the edge of the Loch, the number of reports rose suddenly. Early in 1934, Author Grant, a young student, was out on his motorcycle one evening when he almost ran into the monster as it crossed the road. Grant's description of the thing - small head, long thin neck and tail with a big body, seemed to match the appearance of the plesiosaur  , an aquatic   type of dinosaur that has been extinct   for 65 million years. The Loch Ness Investigation Bureau was formed in 1962 to act as a research organization for information about the creature. Even now, efforts have continued to find the monster. A great deal of information was discovered about the Loch, but there isn't any yet to produce any specific evidence of a monster. Skeptics   argue that the water in the Loch is too cold for a plesiosaur to live in. They also argue that an air-breathing animal, like a whale or seal, would spend much more time on the surface than the creature seems to, and would be spotted more often. Some scientists have wondered if the sightings might be caused by an underwater wave which is known to sometimes occur in deep, long, and cold lakes, like Loch Ness. Such a wave might push debris   to the surface that might look like a strange animal. However, none of these is identified. According to the skeptics, which of the following is TRUE?", "subject": ""}

{"answer": 2, "choices": ["Optimistic.", "Grateful.", "Cautious.", "Enthusiastic."], "question": "Koala bears as pets might be appealing to many of us. However, there are quite a few points to consider even before thinking of adopting one. Koala bears are one of the most lovely Australian animals. In certain cases where the koala has been raised by hand, they have turned out to be quite affectionate pets. These people tied a piece of fur to a pillow and placed it beside a joey (a baby kola) as a substitute   for the mother koala. This trick seemed to work well with the baby koala. However, it is a known fact that human handling causes stress to koalas. In my personal opinion, this aspect clouds the fact that koala bears can be tamed  . In Australia the koala is a priority animal as far as conservation status assessment is concerned. It was hunted to near extinction   for its fur. In fact the koala had been wiped out from South Australia in the 1920s. However, rehabilitation efforts have brought the animal back in the state. As for the Australia government, the koala is not a threatened animal, but the US government does list the koala as one. Although they may live in 40 to 60 kinds of eucalyptus trees, they prefer only 10 to 14 specific kinds. Koalas sleep for most part of the day, which is about 16 to 18 hours, and for most of their waking hours all they do is eat. Koala bears eat the leaves of eucalyptus trees. A full-grown koala can eat almost 2 to 3 pounds of leaves in a day. Despite their slow movements and sweet look, koala bears can be _ when hungry. Other than this, there are the stress caused to koalas due to human handling and the fights that start in koalas. Almost everyone finds koalas lovely in the zoo.

But what is the key to success? How can you be successful? I think we should measure success based on how much we give rather than how much we receive. Fortunately, it also works nicely the other way around since those who give more almost always will also receive more. So how do you pave your way to success? How do you become more successful? The answer is amazingly simple: the key to success is making yourself as useful as possible to others. Here are some ideas on how to do it. 1. Be observant of needs To be useful to others, you should always be aware of even the slightest clues of needs. The more sensitive you are to the needs of others, the more appreciative people will eventually become. The best plan is being able to a need before the other people are even aware of it. 2. Find solutions to the needs Now that you are aware of needs, the next step is finding solutions to them. The solutions you offer should be as useful as possible. To be able to do so, there is no other way but to continuously build your own value. It is from the value you have that you could give value to others. 3. Be proactive to help Do not wait for the other person to ask for your help. Be proactive. Give your help even before they ask. 4.   _   What matters is not only the solution you offer, but also the way you deliver it. Being sincere means being glad to help others without expecting anything in return. Make it your joy to give something to others. People can somehow distinguish whether or not you are sincere. 5. Go the extra mile Doing the above four steps is good, but add this one if you can: give more than expected. First, give what is expected, and then add a little more. If you do the above four steps people will be appreciative, but if you add this one step they will be impressed. What is the measure of success according to the author?", "subject": ""}

The discovery was made by researchers at York and Harvard Universities when they were examining the genetic relationship between the ancient woolly mammoth and mastodon to modern elephants -- the Asian elephant, African forest elephant, and African savanna elephant. Once they obtained DNA sequences  from two fossils , mammoths,and mastodons the team compared them with DNA from modern elephants. They found to their amazement that modern forest and savanna elephants are as distinct from each other as Asian elephants and mammoths. The scientists used detailed genetic analysis to prove that the African savanna elephant and the African forest elephant have been distinct species for several million years. The divergence of the two species took place around the time of the divergence of Asian elephants and woolly mammoths. This result amazed all the scientists. There has long been debate in the scientific community that the two might be separate species, but this is the most convincing scientific evidence so far that they are indeed different species. Previously, many naturalists believed that African savanna elephants and African forest elephants were two populations of the same species, despite the elephants' significant size differences. The savanna elephant has an average shoulder height of 3.5 metres while the forest elephant has an average shoulder height of 2.5 metres. The savanna elephant weighs between six and seven tons, roughly double the weight of the forest elephant.

Now an hour before classes start,every seat in the library is taken by students eager to get online.The teacher talks about rocks as students view them at a colorful website,after school students on buses pull laptops from backpacks to get started on homework.Since the computers arrived,scores in state tests are up 35%and the enrollment increases by 20%.

{"answer": 1, "choices": ["Because it tastes and smells good.", "Because it is not easily noticed.", "Because it kills and injures people.", "Because it always harm people.[."], "question": "Carbon monoxide  poisoning kills and injures many people and animals around the world. The gas has been a problem since people first began burning fuels to cook food or to create heat. It is a problem in all parts of the world that experience cold weather. Carbon monoxide is called the silent killer because people do not know it is in the air. The gas has no color1. It has no taste. It has no smell. It does not cause burning eyes. And it does not cause people to cough. But it is very deadly. It robs the body of its ability to use oxygen. Carbon monoxide decreases the ability of the blood to carry oxygen to body tissues. It does this by linking with the blood. When the gas links with the blood, the blood is no longer able to carry oxygen to the tissues that need it. Damage to the body can begin very quickly from large amounts of carbon monoxide. How quickly this happens depends on the length of time a person is breathing the gas and the amount of the gas he or she breathes in.  Carbon monoxide poisoning has warning signs. But people have to be awake to recognize them. Small amounts of the gas will cause a person's head to hurt. He or she may begin to feel tired. The person may feel sick. The room may appear to be turning around. The person may have trouble thinking clearly. People develop severe head pain as the amount of gas continues to enter their blood. They will begin to feel very tired and sleepy. They may have terrible stomach pains. Medical experts say carbon monoxide affects people differently. For example, a small child will experience health problems or die much quicker than an adult will. The general health of the person or his or her age can also be important. An older adult with health problems may suffer the effects of carbon monoxide more quickly than a younger person with no health problems. People with heart disease may suffer chest pains.

Among professional basketball players, Jeremy Lin's background is not typical. He graduated from Harvard University, which sends few players to the NBA, and he is the only Chinese-American NBA player. But when you watch him on the court, there is no doubt that he belongs there. He moves with speed and grace that demonstrate years of faithful practice, which is fueled by a love for basketball. Lin's enjoyment to basketball actually began in Taiwan. When Lin's father moved to U.S., his interest in the sport only grew and he passed on this love of basketball to his son, introducing him to the game at the age of five. The young Lin spent much of his youth playing basketball for fun. In high school, Lin dreamed of playing in the NBA. When he applied for college, he was not offered a single sports scholarship. However, after his admission to Harvard ,he was offered a place on its college basketball team. During Lin's time at Harvard, his basketball career began to speed up. He scored 1,482 points, making him one of the highest scorers in Ivy League history. When he graduated, no professional teams offered Lin a contract, but he was invited to play in the NBA Summer League. He played well and ended up eagerly signing a contract with the Golden State Warriors. At first, playing in professional games filled Lin with excitement. He treasured opportunities to meet players he had been watching on TV for years. But slowly, the excitement wore off and was replaced by anxiety. In a few very difficult months, he was cut by two teams before the New York Knicks picked him up. But he had the courage and determination to stick to his dream, so he put himself into hard training to get ready for his opportunity to come, Then his moment arrived on February4, 2012,on which his excellent performance made him famous overnight. After that, he led the Knicks to their fifth straight victory. The Associated Press called Lin\"the most surprising story in the NBA.\"Knicks fans developed the nickname for him\"linsanity\" .Time magazine released its 2012 list of the 100\"Most Influential People in the World\",Jermy Lin included.

But most insiders agree there is disease at both ends of the business--where film are produced, and where they're shown---that may take years to overcome.

But due to a static audience base, eight major chains have gone into bankruptcy and several others are in terrible financial situations. In fact, insiders say, Hollywood is now in a business it does not want to be in. \"There's a general problem in that the companies that have the most consistent output of material are least interested in what they're making,\" says former 20thCentury Fox CEO, Bill.

A survey by the Workforce Solutions Group at St. Louis Community College finds that more than 60% of employers say applicants lack the ability to communicate and get along with others--- a jump pf about 10 percentage points in just two years. A large number of managers also say today's applicants can't think creatively, solve problems or write well. Jobs are going unfilled as a result, which hurts companies and employers.

More than 80% of employers want new graduates they hire to have completed a formal internship, but only 8% of students say having an internship in a field related to their major is something they spend a lot of time doing. Instead, the top extracurricular activities   are hanging out with friends, working in an unrelated job and eating out. And all internships are not created equal.

We all seem to be making great efforts towards this goal of happiness but what is it really? It is an agreed fact that all the creatures want happiness and are afraid of pain and sadness. The question, however, is \"what is real happiness?\" What really is called happiness? The desire for happiness has no meaning without understanding the real nature of happiness. Some thinkers say, \"Happiness does not lie in objects of enjoyment; happiness or unhappiness lies in imagination.\" To prove their belief, they give examples like the following one: A man has a two-storey house; on the right is a five-storey building and on the left a cottage. When he sees right, he feels unhappy and when he sees left he feels happy. As such happiness does not lie in possession of sensory objects, but in imagination. They advise people to look towards those who have fewer possessions and be happy. If you look towards people having more wealth and possessions, you will always be unhappy. It is unreasonable to hold this point of view. It is unkind to regard one happy by imagining that one is better than the poor and the unhappy. \"If you want to be happy, look towards the poor\". We know that those poor people cannot satisfy even their basic needs. This attitude satisfies the sense of pride of possessions, but this can never be called happiness. Unless we really find where happiness lies, we cannot really be happy. Some ask people to do this and do that and say, \"This way your desires would be satisfied. You would get the desired objects and become happy.\" People holding these views regard happiness as satisfaction of desires. But it is not possible to satisfy one's desires because there are countless desires of countless people and the material things are limited. Then new desires arise as soon as the previous ones are satisfied. Therefore, desires, which are changing all the time, can never be satisfied.

People who learn to control inner experience will be able to determine the quality of their lives and come to being happy. Happiness lies in the distribution of easiness among others. Happiness stands for forgiveness and justice. Happiness is the name of struggle and courage. Happiness may be founded in seeking of true knowledge and rule of wisdom.

Some thinkers say, \"Happiness does not lie in objects of enjoyment; happiness or unhappiness lies in imagination.\" To prove their belief, they give examples like the following one: A man has a two-storey house; on the right is a five-storey building and on the left a cottage. When he sees right, he feels unhappy and when he sees left he feels happy. As such happiness does not lie in possession of sensory objects, but in imagination. They advise people to look towards those who have fewer possessions and be happy. If you look towards people having more wealth and possessions, you will always be unhappy. It is unreasonable to hold this point of view. It is unkind to regard one happy by imagining that one is better than the poor and the unhappy. \"If you want to be happy, look towards the poor\". We know that those poor people cannot satisfy even their basic needs. This attitude satisfies the sense of pride of possessions, but this can never be called happiness. Unless we really find where happiness lies, we cannot really be happy. Some ask people to do this and do that and say, \"This way your desires would be satisfied. You would get the desired objects and become happy.\" People holding these views regard happiness as satisfaction of desires. But it is not possible to satisfy one's desires because there are countless desires of countless people and the material things are limited. Then new desires arise as soon as the previous ones are satisfied. Therefore, desires, which are changing all the time, can never be satisfied. Happiness is a characteristic of a good life, that is, a life in which a person fulfills   human nature in an excellent way. People have a set of purposes which are typically human: these belong to our nature. Happiness is also a condition that must be prepared for, cultivated  , and defended privately by each person. People who learn to control inner experience will be able to determine the quality of their lives and come to being happy. Happiness lies in the distribution of easiness among others. Happiness stands for forgiveness and justice. Happiness is the name of struggle and courage. Happiness may be founded in seeking of true knowledge and rule of wisdom.

{"answer": 1, "choices": ["benefit the farmers", "get entertainment", "show off their wealth", "limit the fox population"], "question": "Foxes and farmers have never got on well. These small dog-like animals have long been accused of killing farm animals. They are officially classified as harmful and farmers try to keep their numbers down by shooting or poisoning them. Famers can also call on the services of their local hunt to control the fox population. Hunting consists of running after a fox across the countryside, with a group of specially trained dogs, followed by men and women riding horses. When the dogs eventually catch the fox, the kill it or a hunter shoots it. People who take part in hunting think of it as a sport. They wear a special uniform of red coats and white trousers, and follow strict rules of behavior. But owning a horse and hunting regularly are expensive, so most hunters are wealthy. It is estimated that up to 100,000 people watch or take part in fox-hunting. But over the last couple of decades the number of people who are against fox-hunting, because they think it is  brutal , has risen sharply. Nowadays it is rare for a hunt to pass off without some kind of conflict between hunters and hunt opponents  . Sometimes these incidents lead to violence, but mostly opponents discourage the hunt by misleading riders and disturbing the trail of the fox's smell, which the dogs follow. Noisy conflicts between hunters and opponents have become so common that they are almost as much a part of hunting as running after foxes itself. But this year supporters of fox-hunting face a much bigger threat to their sport.

As any serious job-hunter knows, it helps to dress smartly and smile at that all-important interview. But research has showed that a firm handshake is what really matters when it comes to impressing potential employers. The US research looked at 98 undergraduates taking part in mock   interviews with businesses. As each undergraduate was graded on their overall performance, five \"handshake raters\" also marked them on their grasp, strength, duration, vigor and eye contact. Professor Greg Stewart, from the University of Iowa, who led the study, said those who scored highly with the handshake raters were also considered to be the most hirable by the interviewers. Students with \" wimpy\" shakes were judged to be more timid and less impressive. The study also found women with a firm handshake were likely to be evaluated more favorably than their male counterparts. Professor Stewart said: \"We've always heard that interviewers make up their mind about a person in the first two or three minutes of an interview.

What's New in Washington's Seaside City? Advice to visit Seattle's Pike Place Market may border on cliche--but for a good reason. \"Whether you're visiting Washington's seaside city for vacation or just stopping by en route to and from the coming Sasquatch music festival, Pike Place is an easy catch-all destination for shopping, eating and just plain walking around,\" said Kirk Johnson, The New York Times's Seattle bureau chief for the past three years. The Seattle Great Wheel is one of many stops to consider in Washington's seaside city. \"Almost any day of the week, especially on the weekend, it's a crazy fun scene of people shopping,\" Mr. Johnson said. \"There's also pretty good food.\" He recommends wandering into whatever place--especially a hole in the wall--catches your eye. There is one specific restaurant Mr. Johnson likes: the Pink Door, which has no signage and can be found only by its rosy entrance. \"It's creative, interesting Italian,\" he said. \"In the summer they get a lot of great fresh vegetables and probably have the best tomato bruschetta I've had.\" He also recommends the nearby Pioneer Square, the oldest neighborhood in Seattle. Its historic architecture has charm, and the area isn't bad for a lunch break, he said. The clear favorite here is Salumi--which, as the name suggests, is known for its cured meats. Mr. Johnson did warn, however, that it's necessary to plan for the fact that the restaurant has a long line as soon as it opens. Pioneer Square is also a portal to Seattle's maritime world that remains alive and well. Ferry rides are a short walk away. Mr. Johnson said the ferry ride to Bainbridge Island provides \"a great view of the city,\" and it's not a long ride back to the mainland. At some point, you may see sculptures emerging on the horizon--that would be the Olympic Sculpture Park, which is operated by the Seattle Art Museum, Mr. Johnson said, and that's worth a visit itself. People who want to experience Seattle's nearby charms can easily do so with a bicycle, Mr. Johnson said, if they want to get away from depending on a car. He takes a ride to Chateau Ste.

With a sense of bad feeling he wrote: \"The ocean has a personality of its own. The place can be such a peaceful environment to be in, yet it can be frightfully violent. I've experienced both.\" Fearing he wouldn't make it home, he placed the note -- dated June 11, 1998 -- in a wine bottle and covered the bottle. \"I included my geographical coordinates, so if anything happened to me, they'd know my last place when I threw the bottle into the ocean,\" says Peter, who was then sailing from the Azores in Portugal to New York and knew the Atlantic could be dangerous. He also included some money with his message, asking whoever found it to use the money to post the letter to his family. Seventeen days later he reached his destination, having survived the dangerous seas, but he assumed his message in the bottle had not -- until it was found on shore, 11 years later! Recently, American woman Katherine Ginn and her friend came across the bottle on a deserted beach in the Bahamas. \"Alongside it they'd found a life jacket and, assuming the worst, opened the bottle and spent 24 hours drying it out so they could read my story and write to my family as I requested,\" says Peter, 44. \"I couldn't believe it -- that after all these years my bottle had turned up with its contents, still undamaged.\" Overjoyed, he wrote to the pair, saying he was alive and living in Australia with his family. Katherine posted him his letter, money and some broken glass of his bottle placed in a tiny box as a special souvenir.

For my 10thbirthday, my sister and I were taken out to the Great Barrier Reef. There were fish in different colors, caves and layers of coral. They made such an impression on me. When I learned that only 1 percent of Australia's Coral Sea was protected, I was shocked. Australian marine life is particularly important because the reef shave more marine species than any other country on earth. But sadly, only 45% of the world's reefs are considered healthy. This statistic is depressing, so it's important to do everything to protect them. The hope that the Coral Sea remains a complete eco-system has led me to take action.

But too much light at other times may actually cause such mood disorder. Long-lasting exposure to light at night brings depression, a new study finds, at least in animals. The new data confirm observations from studies of people who work night shifts, says Richard Stevens of the University of Connecticut Health Center. Mood disorders join a growing list of problems, including cancer, obesity and diabetes that can occur when light throws life out of balance by disturbing the biological clock and its timing of daily rhythms. In the new study, Tracy Bedrosian and Randy Nelson of Ohio State University exposed mice to normal light and dark cycles for four weeks. For the next four weeks, half of the mice remained on this schedule, and the rest received continuous dim light throughout their night. Compared with mice exposed to normal night-time darkness, those getting dim light at night lost their strong preference for sweet drinks. \"A sign that they no longer get pleasure out of activities they once enjoyed,\" Bedrosian says. In a second test, mice were clocked on how long they actively tried to escape a pool of water. Those exposed to night lights stopped struggling and just floated in the water, a sign of \"behavioral despair\", 10 times as long as the mice that had experienced normal night-time darkness. All symptoms of depression disappeared within two weeks of the mice returning to a normal light-dark cycle, the researchers report. The scientists could also _ the behavioral symptoms by injecting the brains of animals with a drug that prohibits the activity of certain molecules linked with human depression. This finding further suggests that light at night may cause something related to depression. Human studies linking night-time light and mood disorders are important but can not easily detect molecular underpinnings  as animal studies can, says George Brainard of Thomas Jefferson University.

{"answer": 1, "choices": ["Twain was more willing to deal with racism.", "Twain's attack on racism was much less open.", "Twain's themes seemed to agree with plots.", "Twain was openly concerned with racism."], "question": "Mark Twain has been called the inventor of the American novel. And he surely deserves additional praise: the man who popularized the clever literary attack on racism. I say clever because anti-slavery fiction had been the important part of the literature in the years before the Civil War. H. B. Stowe's Uncle Tom's Cabin is only the most famous example. These early stories dealt directly with slavery. With minor exceptions, Twain planted his attacks on slavery and prejudice into tales that were on the surface about something else entirely. He drew his readers into the argument by drawing them into the story. Again and again, in the postwar years, Twain seemed forced to deal with the challenge of race. Consider the most controversial, at least today, of Twain's novels, Adventures of Huckleberry Finn. Only a few books have been kicked off the shelves as often as Huckleberry Finn, Twain's most widely read tale. Once upon a time, people hated the book because it struck them as rude. Twain himself wrote that those who banned the book considered the novel \"trash and suitable only for the slums  .\" More recently the book has been attacked because of the character Jim, the escaped slave, and many occurences of the word nigger.

People are particularly concerned that the radiation will put cellphone users at a higher risk of suffering from cancer. However, studies of the association between cellphone use and the risk of brain cancer have reached different conclusions(some, but not all, studies showed increased risk). Researchers conducted a study to examine if cellphone radiation affected regional activity in the human brain. The study, conducted between January 1 and December 31, 2009,included 47 participants. Cellphones were placed on the left and right ears, and brain imaging was performed to measure brain glucose metabolism  twice: one with the right cellphone activated for 50 minutes(\"on\" condition) and once with both cellphones deactivated(\"off\" condition). An analysis was conducted to check the association of metabolism and cellphone radiation. The scans were compared to assess the effect of cellphone use on brain glucose metabolism. The researchers found that whole-brain metabolism did not differ between the on and off conditions. However there were regional effects. Metabolism in some brain region was higher (about 7 percent) for cellphone on than for cellphone off conditions. This indicates that the regions expected to absorb more cellphone radiation were the ones that showed the larger increases in glucose metabolism. These results provide evidence that the human brain is sensitive to the effects of acute  cellphone radiation. However, how cellphone radiation could affect brain glucose metabolism is unclear. Concerns have been raised by the possibility that cellphone radiation may  _ brain cancer. Results of this study provide evidence that acute cellphone radiation affects brain metabolic activity. However, these results provide no information as to their connection regarding possible carcinogenic  effects (or lack of such effects) of chronic  cellphone use. Further studies are needed to assess if these effects could have long-term harm. What does the passage mainly talk about?", "subject": ""}

The dialogue, which takes place early in the first episode, immediately indicates that this is no ordinary South Korean drama. There's no family feud, or secret crush, or love tangles, or guesses and misunderstandings. The 16-episode show is set in the fictional war-torn country of Uruk . Song Joong-ki is the leader of a special warfare command unit, while Song Hye-kyo plays a doctor who works for a humanitarian medical organization. Both are sent in the midst of disaster and disease as part of their work with UN peacekeeping troops. Both know and show clearly what they want and what they hate. But what stands out the most are Song's skills as a pick-up artist . Boldness and creativity are the key weapons in his arsenal. When Kang invites Yoo to drink wine with her, Yoo, who is not allowed to drink alcohol as a soldier, says, \"There is a way\" before kissing her. Forget about the \"eighth-episode rule\". This kiss happens in the fourth. Humor also does the trick. On their first date in a cinema, Yoo says, \"This is the most exciting moment of my life.

Teenagers also cause discipline problems.As a teacher, I had a 16-year-old student who had fallen in love with a waiter at a fast-food restaurant.In fact,she had left home to stay with him.So we decided to put her in the school hostel.She refused.When she heard her mother begging her to stay in the hostel she turned round and said:\"Why don't you stay in the hostel if you like it so much?\" My palms were itching to slap her for being so rude but the poor mother continued to _ her,hoping that gentle persuasion would work wonders.It did not.The last I heard,she had run away from home again. The list goes on and on.Could it be that today's parents are softer and believe that they must not rod their children for fear of the bad result? Or do they actually believe that the children will get rid of the bad habits and behave well naturally as they grow older? I beg to disagree.I believe it is the parents' duty to discipline the children even at a young age. My children who are now adults will prove the fact that I used the rod when I thought it necessary.Later when they went abroad,they related to their British university friends on how they were disciplined.Their friends abroad were filled with horror and told my daughter that I could be charged with child abuse .However,my daughter showed great respect for me when she told them that she would not be where she was today if not for my strict discipline.

It's hard to believe, but you can find out a number of things about a woman's personality just by looking at the type of handbag she carries. Below you will find a number of handbag styles and colors as well as what each specific type of handbag says about the owner. Styles: Under-the Shoulder - handbags which are smaller and fit tightly underneath the shoulder indicate class and sophistication. A women working in an upscale office or someone of high status would choose this form of handbag. Big and Bulky - Big, bulky and oversized bags are casual and are often associated with younger individuals. These are used for individuals who carry a number of things (binders, books etc) and require a lot of space. Down-to-earth, lower-maintenance women would carry this type of handbag. Designer - Designer handbags often cost an arm and a leg and therefore are usually associated with high-maintenance females. Females who are confident and require top of the line accessories will settle for nothing less than a name-brand designer purse. Guys watch out for these girls, they tend to be a handful. Cigar Box Purses - A women who carries a cigar box purse likes to be unique and stand out from the crowd. These women have minds of their own and cannot be told what to do. They are comfortable in their own skin and tend to be very independent. Leather with Buckles and Zippers - women who choose leather purses with lots of buckles and zippers are leashing out their wild sides. These women tend to act before they think and are always ready for a good time. The extra buckles and zippers tend to signify a \"bad girl\" image. Colors: Bright Colors - Bright colored handbags like pink, purple, bright blue and green indicate that the woman is fun, friendly and approachable. Women who are out-going and sociable will tend to choose these colors. This is the type of woman who will strike up a conversation with a complete stranger. Black and Brown - women who choose black or brown handbags tend to be more formal in manners and are often mistaken as being snobby or restricted. These types of handbags are often associated with down-to-earth women, who are shy at first, but open up after a while. They tend to exude a shy confidence, which is sometimes mistaken as someone who thinks she's better than others. The style and color of your handbag says a lot about you. Choose your handbag very carefully and remember you can choose more than one style.

Without such problems, animals in zoos should live to an old age. But that may not be true for the largest land animals on earth. Scientists have known that elephants in zoos often suffer from poor health. They develop diseases and behaviour changes. Sometimes, they even become infertile, or unable to have babies. To learn more about how elephants are affected, a team of international scientists compared the life spans of elephants born in zoos with those living outdoors in their native lands. Zoos keep detailed records of all the animals, such as birth dates, illnesses, weight and death. These records made it possible for the researchers to analyse 40 years of data on 800 African and Asian elephants in zoos across Europe. The team found that female African elephants born in zoos lived an average of 16.9 years while those in the wild lived an average of 56 years. Scientists don't yet know why wild elephants seem to be so much better than their zooraised elephants. Georgia Mason, a biologist who led the study, thinks stress and obesity   may be to blame.

It turns out that the answer depends not only on your age, but also on your lifestyle. Some people are productive and happy with fewer hours of sleep, while others need more.

The foundation acknowledges that sleep needs will vary -- lifestyle and stress should be taken into consideration -- but their recommendations offer a general guideline. For example, teenagers (14 --17 years old) need 8--10 hours' sleep every day. To create the recommendations, some sleep and medical experts reviewed 312 articles from journals published during the last decade. This is the first time that any professional organization has developed age-specific recommended sleep durations based on a systematic review of the world scientific literature. A lack of sleep can be linked to weight gain, because that causes an increase in appetite, according to the foundation. It can also have serious consequences on the brain. People who do not get enough sleep are at increased risk for depression, and can endanger others. Those that become sleepy while driving, for example, risk both their lives and the lives of those around them. Researchers also have found in the past that too much sleep can have negative effects.

They succeeded at last in 1707, and some Scots have never forgiven them. Scotland is now governed from London, but in some ways it is still a separate nation. It has its own capital city(Edinburgh),its own law, and its own stamps, it even has a language of its own, spoken now by only a few people in the islands.

In fact, until the eighteenth century Scotland was an independent country, with a parliament of its own. The English had tried many times over many centuries to bring Scotland under their rule. They succeeded at last in 1707, and some Scots have never forgiven them. Scotland is now governed from London, but in some ways it is still a separate nation. It has its own capital city(Edinburgh),its own law, and its own stamps, it even has a language of its own, spoken now by only a few people in the islands.

At that moment, I smiled. I don't know why I did that. Perhaps it was nervousness, perhaps it was because, when you get very close, one to another, it is very hard not to smile. In any case, I smiled. In that instant, it was as though a spark jumped across the gap between our two hearts, our two human souls. I know he didn't want to, but my smile leaped through the bars and caused a smile on his lips, too. He lit my cigarette but stayed near, looking at me directly in the eyes and continuing to smile. I kept smiling at him, now thinking of him as a person and not just a guard. \"Do you have kids?\" he asked. \"Yes, here, here.\" I took out my wallet and nervously fumbled for the pictures of my family.

Not only are they in the habit of making knee-jerk  judgments, but violent people cause harm, and therefore their suffering seems to deserve less sympathy. You hurt me, so why should I have sympathy for you? It should be the other way around. Does it take a saint  to make the change from strong anger to sympathy? Turning points arrive when we can make a choice not to suffer in silence. We then strike a soul bargain that is fearful but necessary. The bargain is that redemption  is possible through love.The absence of love is absolutely the problem, and love is absolutely the solution. We don't have to reach into another area to locate the magic power of love that is available to us here and now.  _ The rule is constant work on the spiritual path to clear away the obstacles that prevent love from coming through us. The work is much more like working on blocked pipe system than it is like copying a saint. Hope is the emotion that keeps this dogged work even when results seem to be slow or impossible. Can I love the terrorist who harms my country? Can I love the criminal who wants to harm me? At the level of the soul I already do, and the spiritual path is a means to arrive at that level. No one is required to leap into sudden sympathy for terrorists, or even to announce publicly that our enemies deserve love. But in our souls each of us harbors the knowledge that only love is going to bring violence to an end. No matter how you and I live our outward lives, our spiritual lives must remain devoted to that vision. Which would be the best title for the passage?", "subject": ""}

As a result, songs sound like noise to an amusic. Many amusics compare the sound of music to pieces of metal hitting each other. Life can be hard for amusics. Their inability to enjoy music set them apart from others. It can be difficult for other people to identify with their condition. In fact, most people cannot begin to grasp what it feels like to be amusic. Just going to a restaurant or a shopping mall can be uncomfortable or even painful. That is why many amusics intentionally stay away from places where there is music. However, this can result in withdrawal and social isolation. \"I used to hate parties,\" says Margaret, a seventy-year-old woman who only recently discovered that she was amusic. By studying people like Margaret, scientists are finally learning how to identify this unusual condition. Scientists say that the brains of amusics are different from the brains of people who can appreciate music. The difference is complex, and it doesn't involve defective hearing. Amusics can understand other nonmusical sounds well. They also have no problems understanding ordinary speech. Scientists compare amusics to people who just can't see certain colors. Many amusics are happy when their condition is finally diagnosed  . For years, Margaret felt embarrassed about her problem with music. Now she knows that she is not alone. There is a name for her condition.

{"answer": 2, "choices": ["Genetic faults of the people.", "Elongation of the eyeball.", "The shortage of outdoor light.", "Lack of research into the problem."], "question": "Up to 90% of school leavers in major Asian cities are suffering from myopia ---short-sightedness, a study suggests. Researchers say the \"extraordinary rise\" in the problem is being caused by students working very hard in school and missing out on outdoor light. Eye experts say that you are short-sighted if your vision is blurred  beyond 2m. It is often caused by an elongation  of the eyeball that happens when people are young. According to the research, the problem is being caused by a combination of factors - a commitment to education and lack of outdoor light. Professor Morgan who led this study argues that many children in South East Asia spend long hours studying at school and doing their homework. This in itself puts pressure on the eyes, but exposure to between two and three hours of daylight helps maintain healthy eyes. Cultural factors also seem to play a part. Across many parts of South East Asia, children often have a lunchtime nap. According to Professor Morgan they are missing out on natural light to prevent short-sightedness. A big concern is the numbers of the students suffering from \"high\" myopia. One in five of these students could experience severe visual impairment  and even blindness. These people are at considerable risk--sometimes people are not told about it and are just given more powerful glasses--they need to be warned about the risk and given some self-testing measures so they can get to an ophthalmologist and get some help. For decades, researchers believed there was a strong genetic component to the condition. But this study strongly suggests an alternative view. \"Any type of simple genetic explanation just doesn't fit with that speed of change; gene pools just don't change in two generations.

The Duke of Kent, who Lear ordered to leave Britain, cannot abandon his king. He therefore comes to Lear disguised as a servant called Caius and asks for a job.

His speech was very raw and very open.  He told us that he gets up every morning and looks in the mirror and asks \"If today were the last day of my life, would I want to do what I am about to do today?\" \"If the answer is not for too many days in a row\", he said, \"it's time to make a change.

That's partially because it appears people who set realistic goals actually work more efficiently, and exert more effort, to achieve those goals.  What are far less understood by scientists, however, are the potentially harmful effects of goal-setting. There has been surprisingly little research on how the practice may have contributed to the current economic crisis and unethical  behavior in general. \"Goals are widely used and promoted as having really beneficial effects. And yet, the same motivation that can push people to exert more effort in a constructive way could also motivate people to be more likely to engage in unethical behaviors,\" says Maurice Schweitzer, an associate professor of operations and information management at Penn's Wharton School. His paper, titled \"Goals Gone Wild: The Systematic Side Effects of Over-Prescribing Goal Setting,\" appears in the February issue of the Academy of Management Perspectives.  \"It turns out there's no economic benefit to just having a goal-you just get a psychological benefit and that's quite motivating in itself,\" Schweitzer says. \"But in many cases, goals have economic rewards that make them more powerful.\" A prime example Schweitzer and his colleagues give is the 2004 closing down of energy-trading titan Enron, where managers used financial rewards to motivate salesmen to meet specific sales goals. The problem, Schweitzer says, is the actual trades were not earning money. Other studies have shown that pressing employees with unrealistic goals can force them to lie, cheat or steal. Such was the case, Schweitzer says, in the early 1990s when Sears imposed a sales target on its auto repair staff. It resulted in employees overcharging for work and completing unnecessary repairs on a companywide basis. Schweitzer admits his research run against a very large body of literature that praises the many benefits of goal-setting. Edwin A. Locke, from the University of Maryland, College Park, and Gary P. Latham, from the University of Toronto, write: \"Goal setting is not going away. Organizations cannot develop without being focused on their desired results any more than an individual can develop without goals to provide a sense of purpose.\" The debate is likely to be popular on in future papers, and the practice of setting goals no doubt will continue. For now, though, the lesson seems to be to put more thought into setting goals. \"They really do help to coordinate and motivate people.

Increasing use of fossil fuels means more carbon dioxide is going into the air, and most of it will eventually be absorbed by seawater. Once in the water, it reacts to form carbonic acid.  Scientists believe that the oceans have already become slightly more acidic over the last century. But these researchers have tried to predict what will happen in the future by combining what we know about the history of the oceans with computer models of climate change. \"This level of acidity will get much more extreme in the future if we continue releasing CO2 into the atmosphere,\" said Dr Caldeira. \"And we predict amounts of future acidity will exceed anything we have seen over the last several hundred million years, let alone perhaps after rare catastrophic events such as asteroid impacts .\" If carbon dioxide release continues unabated , ocean pH could be reduced by as much as 0.77 units, the authors warn. It is not  ly clear what that means for marine life, however. Most organisms live near the surface, where the greatest pH change would be expected to occur, but deep-ocean lifeforms may be more sensitive to pH changes. Coral reefs and other organisms whose skeletons or shells contain calcium carbonate may be particularly affected, the team speculate. They could find it much more difficult to build these structures in water with a lower pH. In recent years some people have suggested deliberately storing carbon dioxide from power stations in the deep ocean as a way of curbing global warming. But Dr Caldeira said that such a strategy should now be re-considered. \"Previously, most experts had looked at ocean absorption of carbon dioxide as a good thing - because in releasing CO2 into the atmosphere we warm the planet; and when CO2 is absorbed by the ocean, it reduces the amount of greenhouse warming.

{"answer": 1, "choices": ["Logic and behaviour.", "Smell and its influence.", "Sense ability and food tastes.", "Olfactory genes and its system."], "question": "Researchers continue to show the power behind our sense of smell.Recent studies have found,among other things,that the smell of foods like pizza can cause uncontrollable anger in drivers on roads. The review explains that smell is unique in its effects on the brain.According to Conrad King,the researcher who carried out the review,\"more than any other senses,the sense of smell goes through the logical part of the brain and acts on the systems concerned with feelings.This is why the smell of baking bread can destroy the best intentions of a dieter.\" Smell,which dictates the unbelievable complexity of food tastes,has always been the least understood of our senses.Our noses are able to detect up to 10,000distinct smells.Our ability to smell and taste this extremely large range of smells is controlled by something like 1,000genes  ,which make up an amazing 3% of the human genome.Researchers Richard Axel and Linda Buck were together awarded a Nobel Prize in 2004for their ground-breaking research on the nature of this extraordinary sense.These two scientists were the first to describe the family of 1,000olfactory   genes and to explain how our olfactory system works. According to one study in the research review,smelling fresh pizza or even the packaging of fast foods can be enough to make drivers feel impatient with other road users.They are then more likely to speed and experience uncontrollable anger on roads.The most reasonable explanation is that these can all make drivers feel hungry,and therefore desperate to satisfy their appetites. In contrast,the smells of peppermint and cinnamon were shown to improve concentration levels as well as reduce drivers'impatience.Similarly,the smells of lemon and coffee appeared to promote clear thinking and mental focus. However,the way genes regulate smell differs from person to person.A study by researchers in Israel has identified at least 50olfactory genes which are switched on in some people and not in others.They believe this may explain why some of us love some smells and tastes while others hate them.The Israel researchers say their study shows that nearly every human being shows a different pattern of active and inactive smell-detecting receptors.

While reading to your child is still the most important thing you can do to build reading skills, there are many techniques that can help. Make reading fun. Play games with your child as you read. Many traditional children's games can be adapted to encourage reading skills. While reading or during play, tell your child, \"I spy with my little eye, something that begins with the letter \"b\". Help the child find something on the page or in the room that begins with that letter. For example, \"I see a barn.\" This can also be used to teach beginning letter sounds.Ispy with my little eye something that begins with the sound \"s\". Help the child find a word that begins with the \"s\" sound. In this variation on the popular game, instruct the child that, \"Simon says, point to something that starts with the letter \"n\". The child can then find an object in the room or a body part, such as the nose, that starts with the letter presented. This can also be used to teach beginning sounds. Make a game out of rhyming   words by making up silly words to rhyme with the child's name or favorite toys. This sets the stage for rhyming real words by showing the child the similarities of sounds. As the child masters making up the words, begin rhyming real words to one another. Tips to raise a successful reader: Put books in places where the child plays. If books are easily _ , children are more likely to pick them up. Let children \"read to you\" by looking at pictures. Making up stories to go along with illustrations helps children discover how words relate to pictures. Take books along on trips or even short visits to the doctor's office or grocery store.

All you have to do is think of the names for some of the products you buy every day and you'll agree that the name and the product are connected in everyone's mind.  In many countries, successful trade or brand names are protected by law. This is so that other companies cannot make a product that looks like another. People might think that they were buying one product and, in fact, be buying something different. Businesses register a company or a product name with the government. In fact, more than 1,000 product and company names are registered every hour. Many companies spend a lot of money to find the right name for their products. A good example of this is in the car industry. Some successful names for cars have powerful associations. The Ford Mustang and the Jaguar are only two examples of choosing the names of animals that are fast and strong.  When a U.S. company decides to sell its product in another country, it has to make sure that the product name translates properly. When Coca-Cola introduced its soft drink to China, it looked for the right name. It wanted a name that would do two things. One was to present its image in Chinese and the second was to be close to its first brand name -Coke. It took some efforts before finding the right word - which sounds similar and translates as \"happiness in the mouth\". Asian company names are not new to the United States.

For colleagues in the East, the pain is more likely to come through a pay cut. Human resource experts say cultural differences explain why Asian companies try harder to preserve jobs in difficult times, which will prevent unemployment and may help Asian economies survive at a time of slowing exports. The East Asian attitude may also make it easier for companies to recover quickly from the economic downturn since they will not need to rehire or train new staff, but build up a more loyal and devoted group. \"In the Confucian mindset , the right thing to do is to share the burden , which is the sense of collective responsibility. While in the West, it's more about individual survival,\" said Michael Benoliel, associate professor of organizational behavior at Singapore Management University (SMU).

No matter why your child has become picky, how you handle the situation can affect his or her future. Therefore, you should know the following reasons for picky children first of all.  _ is common in children; it often happens at the dinner table. Some children just refuse to try new food because they don't know what it will taste like, while others dislike new food before even smelling it. Some children take it to the extreme  and will only eat a few foods that they like. Psychologist Dr. Elizabeth Capaldi says that, by the time children reach the age of two, they have formed their own eating habits that they don't want to be disturbed by new offerings at the table. A newly published study led by Dr. Lucy Cooke of University College London showed that picky eating in children results from genetic  and environmental causes. The research, which followed the eating habits of 5,390 pairs of twins between the ages of 8 and 11, found that about 75% of the neophobia in the children was from their parents, while 25% was due to the influence of environment. Children grow at a high speed during their first year, but that fast-paced growth tends to slow down by their second year. When children are not experiencing one of those fast growth periods, their body needs less energy; and that results in a smaller appetite . When children are not hungry, they tend to enjoy only food they like. They refuse new food and food that is not their favourite. Some children will limit the amount of food to only one kind, like hamburgers or pancakes, leaving all the other foods untouched. In some cases, many real reasons why a child behaves as a picky eater exist. About 5% of children who are 10 years of age or younger have some type of neurological dysfunction  that influences their eating habits. These children may be easily hurt by some special smells, or their brain may not be able to process such sensory information properly.

{"answer": 2, "choices": ["release small turtles", "bury turtle eggs deeper", "look for newly laid turtle eggs", "clear away trash from the seaside"], "question": "It's 4 am, and Danilo C. Dequina is already awake. Holding a flashlight and a bucket, he is walking in the pre-dawn darkness along the shore of Old Poblacion Beach in the town of Maitum, Sarangani, in the far south of the Philippines. A few minutes later, he spots a patch of sand that appears to have been disturbed by a turtle. Dequina studies the area carefully, figuring out where the eggs have been buried, and then starts digging slowly. After clearing away several centimeters of sand, he uncovers a large group of eggs, roughly the size of ping-pong balls. He picks them up and puts them in the bucket. Dequina carries the eggs to his hatchery  , some 50 meters away from the seashore. The hatchery is really just a sandy patch of land under the coconut trees enclosed by a black fence. It is here that he buries the turtle eggs he has collected. Today, Dequina scoops a hole, puts the eggs in it, and covers them with sand. After 45 to 70 days, the eggs will hatch.

Education is essential. It will help me get accepted to college if I perform well academically and advance my opportunities for success in the future. Most jobs now require at least a high school diploma, and for many jobs, a college degree is preferred. It is important that all students have excellent educators in their life to help them achieve and have the opportunity to go to college, get a job, support themselves and their family, and impact the community. As we celebrate and honor all teachers during Teacher Appreciation Week, I've reflected on the impact my teachers have had, and will continue to have, in my life. From Mr. Bowker, who challenged me in math, to Mr. Bernsteen, my health teacher who taught me the value of hard work, my teachers have helped shape the student I am today. But one of the teachers who left a lasting impression on me was my summer school teacher, Mr. Davis, who impacted me beyond the classroom. He found time to connect with me on a personal level and talk to me after class. I felt like Mr. Davis cared about my academic success and was committed to setting an example of what's possible. Mr. Davis could relate to what it was like to be a rising ninth-grade black male in today's society. He taught me how to speak up confidently and share my ideas with others. He told me that I was brilliant and that when I spoke, the world should listen. And when I would put my hand down because I was unsure of my answer, Mr. Davis would immediately say, \"No _ , no glory.\" He never made me feel inadequate; he encouraged me to always pursue knowledge because he, too, was learning every day. Mr. Davis helped me navigate the challenges and take advantage of the opportunities. I think having more black male teachers like Mr. Davis in the classroom could increase student success. They would share the background and experiences of many of their students and help build long-lasting teacher/student relationships.

The numbers for black male teachers are more discouraging. Just 2 percent of teachers nationwide are black men. But you can help change the numbers. Whether you decide to study education in college or graduate school, or apply to programs in Las Vegas such as Teach For America, I hope more black males will consider teaching as a career.

Whether it is a shopping bag, a food bag or a trash bag, they are all made of plastic bags. Grocery store owners are very generous in using plastic bags. They place the fruit in one bag and drop the box of milk in another. Ever wonder why? The positive side of plastic bags Grocery stores, shopping centres, and restaurants are not thrifty in using and giving out plastic bags because they cost no more than a cent each, while a paper bag costs four cents. Plastic bags are produced so cheaply and massively that they are used by 80% of store owners. In addition, they are light and very easy to carry and store. The production of plastic bags has increased greatly over the last 20 years and producers of plastic bags are making large profits. However, the negative side of plastic bags is becoming well-known. More people are now getting worried that the earth is becoming a victim of the plastic bag success story. The negative side of plastic bags While production and consumption of plastic bags is good for business, it is not so for our Mother Earth. They have resulted in an increase in the amount of litter found floating in water or in the streets where we live. Plastic storage bags, after usage, usually go to landfills as trash bags. They make the oceans poison sea animals. They give off toxins when burned. They simply pollute the ground, air and water. That is the true cost of plastic bags, and it looks like it is more than a cent. These are very alarming concerns and proper action needs to be taken.

Not being the best but toughing the limits of what you're capable of. I gained this belief from my third grade teacher, the most special, honored, trustworthy, and loved person in my life. Mr. Myrus was always perfectly dressed and spoke with the belief that talking to eight-year-olds didn't mean he had to sacrifice proper statements or grammars. And he was demanding but he wasn't unreasonable or cruel. He simply felt that no matter what your best was, you should achieve it. As luck would have it, I met him again as my eighth grade math teacher. I was not, nor ever will be, gifted in math. I remember my struggles in class. \"I don't know the answer,\" I would say, \"I can't do it!\" \"Perhaps you don't know the answer,\" he would say quietly. \"Do you think we might figure it out together? How do you know what you can do until you try?\" Mr. Myrus lived around the corner, and I would often stop by to talk while he worked in his garden. I knew there was someone who let me know that if I had really tried, that was enough. \"Don't be so hard on yourself,\" he'd say. \"Stop blaming yourself. Did you try your best? Well, then you're not a failure,\" he often told me these words. Mr. Myrus died in 1978. I had never thought about his death. He was too young. I felt sorry. But when I think about him now, I don't feel so sorry. He taught me to be kind, not only to others, but to myself. He taught me my own value. He taught me about honor, about truth, and about doing my best--and that all feelings and beliefs have dignity and deserve respect.

In 2014, researchers at New York's Columbia University interviewed 20 renters and homeowners in a low-income community in New York City before and after helping those people make energy-efficiency upgrades to their homes. The researchers found cold and heat caused not only extreme physical discomfort but health problems as well. Increased heating costs in winter months also used up so much of people's budgets they were forced to reduce their calorie intake. Additionally, poor air quality due to reduced air-conditioner use can increase the risk of illness. People whose homes were upgraded reported greater physical and mental ease, as well as energy savings of around 30 percent, averaging $20-$60 per month. Despite these benefits, a study by University of Chicago economists was critical of the cost-effectiveness of government programs that provide money for energy-efficiency upgrades for low-income households. Around 7,500 households in Michigan were given an average of $5,000 worth of free upgrades as part of a larger energy-efficiency program. The researchers found that the measures reduced the households' energy consumption by about 10-20 percent each month. However, these savings would amount to an average of just $2,400 over the lifetime of the upgrades--in other words, less than half the amount of the initial investment. The study also highlighted another issue regarding energy-efficiency programs.

In the University of Chicago study, however, an intensive marketing campaign consisting of thousands of telephone calls and home visits raised the Michigan program's participation rate by only a few percentage points.

What are positive ions? Well, the air is full of ions, electrically charged particles, and generally there is a rough balance between the positive and the negative charged. But sometimes this balance becomes disturbed and a larger proportion of positive ions are found. This happens naturally before thunderstorm, earthquakes when winds are blowing in certain countries. Or it can be caused by a build-up of static electricity indoors from carpets or clothing, or from TV sets, duplicators or computer display screens. When a large number of positive ions are present in the air many people experience unpleasant effects such as headaches, fatigue  , excessive anger, and some particularly sensitive people feel sick or even suffer mental disturbance. Animals are also affected, particularly before earthquakes, snakes have been observed to come out, rats to flee from their burrows, dogs howl and cats jump about unaccountably. This has led the US Geographical Survey to fund a network of volunteers to watch animals in an effort to foresee such disasters before they hit vulnerable areas such as California. Conversely, when large numbers of negative ions are present, then people have a feeling of well-being. Natural conditions that produce these large amounts are near the sea, close to waterfalls or fountains, or in any place where water is sprayed, or forms a spray. This probably accounts for the beneficial effect of a holiday by the sea, or in the mountains with streams or waterfalls.

{"answer": 1, "choices": ["The popularity of hiking in the world today.", "The reasons why people go hiking.", "Hiking's benefits for health.", "Making your hiking plan before going outdoors."], "question": "Hiking is an outdoor activity which consists of walking in natural environments, often in mountainous or other scenic terrain  . People often hike on hiking trails. It is such a popular activity that there are numerous hiking organizations worldwide. It is considered one of the recreational activities. Many people say they go hiking because they love to walk outdoor, without necessarily having a destination ahead of them. This makes hiking much more different than walking down the street to the store or to some other places that we need to go. People who like hiking say, \"We enjoy ourselves along the way whether we arrive somewhere important or not.\" Some people add another reason for hiking to the basic one of loving to be outdoors. These folks see hiking as not only mentally healthy for clearing the mind but also physically healthy as great exercise for the body. Unlike some other exercise programs, hiking can be an activity for almost anyone in reasonably good health. Hiking on a smooth, level path is even good exercise. Trudging   over rougher terrain can be a workout and a time of enjoyment at the same time. Some people who hike on a regular basis give little thought to the exercise part of the activity. These people are more likely to go hiking because they are exploring nature. They may be interested in the trees or the rocks. Perhaps they are interested in looking at the birds or the various animals that lodge in the forest or the park. Certainly park land is ideal for hiking. Many of these sites have marked for hiking. This leads many to take part in hiking specifically for the exercise and enjoyment of being outdoors, when they may not do this otherwise. Some people look at hiking as having two major benefits. When asked why they go hiking in their spare time many people will combine these reasons: It helps me relax; it doesn't take a great investment of money for equipment. For them, a good pair of shoes and some comfortable clothes can help them get away from work or other stressful situations that may arise in life. In many cases, these hikers can enjoy their favorite pastime all year long. They may be able to take those outdoor walks in almost any weather. It's safe to say that hiking can heal and please the human being in many ways. What is the text mainly about?", "subject": ""}

In an exclusive interview with CCTV, China's ambassador to Cambodia, Pan Guangxue, says Sihanouk made indelible  contributions to Sino-Cambodian relations and his death will not affect the friendship between the two countries. Since its founding, the People's Republic of China has maintained close contact with Cambodia. Bilateral  trade volume has increased rapidly in recent years, from 200 million US dollars in 2002 to nearly 2.5 billion US dollars in 2011. China is now not only Cambodia's third largest trading partner, but for many years has been Cambodia's number one investor. Norodom Sihanouk, Cambodia's \"King-Father\" pioneered the relationship. Pan Guangxue said, \"If we look back at previous decades, I think Sihanouk made the right choice, a choice good to Cambodian national development. It was because of his commitment to the development of Sino-Cambodia friendship that we've achieved what we have today.\" In 2010, the two countries established a comprehensive strategic partnership, during its Prime Minister Hun Sen's visit to China.

He will be glad to eat foods that he has helped to put on the table. The mealtime environment has a lot to do with how your child will feel about food. Try to serve your meals at the same place at the same time of a day. Keep the meal itself as the main event and leave the toys and television for later use. Snacks are also important. We can give our body and brain energy   by eating snacks between meals. Children are often hungriest in the afternoon after school and in the evening. Offer snacks at regular time between meals.

Simply leave the books lying on the table where your child is sure to see them. Computer games are not as harmful as most parents usually think them to be. Instead, you should take advantage of your child's love of computer games to purchase those that require a lot of reading and avoid those that are simply computerized video games. Buy your child a bedside reading lamp, or a tiny book light. Tell him that from now on, he must be in bed by a specific time (say 8:30) and that he can either sleep or read. Most kids will do anything else rather than go to sleep, so there's a chance you'll create a new bedtime reading habit. Many children will read when they are sitting alone having a snack, or when they have a few minutes of unplanned free time. Put a box of books and magazines near the kitchen table so that reading material is accessible. Often, once children learn to read independently, parents stop reading to them. This change of routine causes great sadness to a child who has come to love falling asleep as you read. Even a teenager will enjoy being read to if you pick books that interest him.

All you have to do is send a few comets in the direction of Earth, and its orbit will be changed. Our world will then be sent spinning into a safer, colder part of the solar system. This idea for improving our climate comes from a group of US National Aeronautics and Space Administration(NASA) engineers and American astronomers. They say their plan could add another six billion years to the useful lifetime of our planet--effectively doubling its working life. The plan put forward by Dr Laughlin, and his colleagues Don Korycansky and Fred Adams is designed to carefully direct a comet or asteroid  so that it passes close by our planet and sends some of its gravitational energy to Earth. \"Earth's orbital speed would increase as a result and we would move to a higher orbit away from the Sun,\" Laughlin said. Engineers would then direct their comet so that it passed close to Jupiter or Saturn. The comet would pick up energy from one of these giant planets. Later its orbit would bring it back to Earth, and the process would be repeated. In the short term, the plan provides an ideal way to global warming, although the team was actually concerned with a much greater danger. The sun is certain to heat up in about a billion years and so \"seriously _ \" our biosphere by cooking us. That's why the group decided to try to save Earth. The plan has one or two worrying aspects, however. For a start, space engineers would have to be very careful about how they directed their asteroid or comet towards Earth. The smallest miscalculation in orbit could fire it straight at Earth--with deadly consequences. There is also the question of the Moon. As the current issue of Scientific American magazine points out, if Earth was pushed out of its current position, it is \"most likely the Moon would be stripped  away from Earth,\" it states.

The 22-year-old felt that his chair was shaking. All of a sudden, the textbooks on the bookshelf began to fall to the floor. The glass in the window broke. \"It felt like our dormitory building was being hit by a tractor,\" recalled Diao. \"I wasn't afraid.. I was even excited and curious. Now, looking back, it was a scary experience.\" Diao and his roommates kept their calm. They didn't try to get out of the building until the shaking stopped. They were on the fifth floor and they feared there might be trouble if they didn't remain calm. \"We've watched lots of disaster films, and that helped us keep cool,\" he said. \"Only one student sprained  his ankle. He was escaping in a hurry. Most of us got outside quickly and safely.\" They were surprised to see so many students outside. \"I began to realize then what had happened,\" he said. The college had warned them that in the event of an earthquake, they should leave the dormitory immediately. A few did rush in when it was safe to grab some clothes to keep warm. Without any tents or bedding, the students stayed on the football field for the whole night. Rain started falling in the morning, but the students all kept in good order. They simply chatted and shared their feelings and comforted each other. \"Our students seemed to have self-control,\" he said. \"I heard that hospitals in Chengdu have lots of injured people who jumped out of buildings.\" Now, Diao is mostly worried about the people in Wenchuan County. \"It seems we won't be able to have classes in one or two day's time,\" said Diao. \"I want to become a volunteer at the damage-hit area, or donate my blood to the injured people in hospital.

The ordinary-looking houses also depend on more windows on south-facing sides, with northerly facing doors protected by porches  . A study found the houses are 50 percent more energy efficient than the average home and use a quarter of the average energy for space heating. According to researchers, they use less than two-thirds of the power of homes built to meet 2010 building demands.

One evening last year a fox was seen on Westminster Bridge looking up at Big Ben. For peregrine falcons, cities are actually safer than rural cliff dwellings  . By 1970 the birds had died out east of the Mississippi because the DDT had made their eggs too thin to support life. That year, scientist Tom Cade of Cornell University began raising the birds for release in cities, for cities afforded abundant food. Cities can attract wild animals without turning them harmful. The trick is to create habitats where they can be self-sufficient but still be seen and appreciated. Such habitats can even be functional. In San Francisco, the local government is testing different kinds of rainwater control basins to see not only which ones retain   the cleanest water but which will attract the most birds.

{"answer": 1, "choices": ["get their parents' individual guidance", "learn a lot from their elder siblings", "experience a lot of difficulties", "pick up words more quickly"], "question": "How is it that siblings   can turn out so differently? One answer is that in fact each sibling grows up in a different family. The firstborn is, for a while, an only child, and therefore has a completely different experience of the parents than those born later. The next child is, for a while, the youngest, until the situation is changed by a new arrival. The mother and father themselves are changing and growing up too. One sibling might live in a stable and close family in the first few years; another might be raised in a family crisis, with a disappointed mother or an angry father. Sibling competition was identified as an important shaping force as early as in 1918. But more recently, researchers have found many ways in which brothers and sisters are a lasting force in each others' lives. Dr. Annette Henderson says firstborn children pick up vocabulary more quickly than their siblings. The reason for this might be that the later children aren't getting the same one-on-one time with parents. But that doesn't mean that the younger children have problems with language development. Later-borns don't enjoy that much talking time with parents, but instead they harvest lessons from bigger brothers and sisters, learning entire phrases and getting an understanding of social concepts such as the difference between \"I\" and \"me\". A Cambridge University study of 140 children found that siblings created a rich world of play that helped them grow socially. Love-hate relationships were common among the children. Even those siblings who fought the most had just as much positive communication as the other sibling pairs. One way children seek more attention from parents is by making themselves different from their siblings, particularly if they are close in age. Researchers have found that the first two children in a family are typically more different from each other than the second and third. Girls with brothers show their differences to a maximum degree by being more feminine than girls with sisters. A 2003 research paper studied adolescents from 185 families over two years, finding that those who changed to make themselves different from their siblings were successful in increasing the amount of warmth they gained from their parents.

Is chat you?\" The woman speaking to me at he baseball game looked somewhat familiar,      \"Marci? \"      \"It IS you ! \" she exclaimed, smiling broadly. \"God, it's good to see you again !\"       It was good to see Marci, too. Very often during the past few decades, I've wondered about her, I almost tried to reach her a few years ago after talking to a shared friend, who had indicated  that the 1990s had been pretty rough for Marci. So, running into her at the baseball game was, at the very least, just happening by chance.          We spent a few minutes talking about the business of our lives: kids and grandkids, husbands and houses, education and recreation. It's always a little upsetting to see how few words are required to summarize 32 years of living. We played a little \"have you seen...?\" and \"did you know,..?\" And we recalled the good old,  bad old days we used to spend together.          Then Marci grew quiet for a moment, looking out over the crowd walking about the marketing area at the stadium.           \"You know,  Joe.\" she said, \"I've always wanted to tell you...how...you know...how sorry I am for the way I treated you.\"       Hearing that, I felt I was suffering extreme embarrassment. One does not like to remember when one has been rid of by others roughly and suddenly.       \"It's OK.\" I said. \"No big deal.\" At least, I thought to myself, not now.       \"But I was so stupid: she continued.       Yes, you were. I thought. \"We were both pretty young:' I said.       \"I know,\" she said. \"But that's no excuse for...\" She hesitated. then continued. \"It's just always bothered me,  remembering how mean I was to you.And I've wanted to tell you that I'm sorry. So...I'm sorry.\"          The smile on her face was warm and sincere, and there was something in her eyes, it looked a lot like relief--  _ since she had played Wif'fle ball with my heart.          \"OK:'I said. \"Apology accepted!     Overcome by the sweetness of the moment. I reached an arm around her and gave her a quick hug Just then, the crowd erupted with a huge cheer, and Marci and I both returned our attention to the game  By the time I looked over to where she had been, she was gone. But the warm, wonderful feeling of our brief exchange was still there, and continues to this day whenever I think about it .

An argument is being made that Goldman Sach's famous marketing device ,the BRICs, should really be the BICs. \"Is Russia really worth the name BRICs?\" asks Anders Aslund, senior fellow at the Peterson Institute for International Economics, in an article for Foreigh Policy. Aslund, who is also co-author with Andrew Kuchins of \"The Russian Balance Sheet\", thinks the Russia of Putin and Medvedev is just not worthy of inclusion alongside Brazil, India and China in the list of future economic powerhouses. He writes: \"The country's economic performance has fallen to such a weak level that one must ask whether it has any say at all on the global economy, compared with the other members of its group. I have just returned from Moscow, which is always dull around this season. For the last seven years, Russia has taken very few measures to improve its economy. Instead, the state has been living on oil and gas. \" Economically, Aslund has the numbers on his side. The International Monetary Fund figures that the Russian economy will fall by 6.7 percent in 2009, while China will grow 8.5 percent and India 5.4 percent. There is less of a case for Brazil, with a fall of 0.7 percent, but it is still doing far better than Russia. But the BRICs are not just about economy.

True, years ago he had a \"drug habit \"for a short time. He \"popped\" pills. But he never used heroin or other \"hard \"drugs. Sometimes he'd go wild and get locked up for a few hours. But he never served a prison sentence. There's no Indian blood in his veins. He's been a killer only in song. As for the \"bullet hole\", it's an old scar left by a doctor who opened a cyst . People who know Johnny Cash well say he's a \"gentle guy\", a \"generous guy'--anything but a \"tough guy\". How did the stories get started? Some of them, like the story about the \"Indian grandmother\", he made up long ago to add excitement to his career. Others, like the \"bullet hole\" , simply got started. Now there's little the singer can do to change people's minds. \"They just want to believe it,\" he says. The passage shows us that many people believe  _  .", "subject": ""}

But many aviation experts wonder why, in our increasingly networked world, divers are searching the Indian Ocean for a metal box when technology already exists that would enable planes to stream black box data to the ground in the event of an emergency. Black boxes have been on planes since the late 1950s, and now every commercial aircraft has two: a flight data recorder and a voice recorder. (Although they are referred to as black boxes, they are typically orange in color, making them easier to spot in waters.) Black box recorders are mainly used to investigate the cause of in-flight accidents. While black boxes are built to survive a crash and long-term submersion in water, it can be a real challenge to find the device if a plane has gone down in the ocean. While each box contains a beacon , the unit only has enough battery power to transmit a signal for 30 days. After the crash of Air France Flight 447 in the Atlantic Ocean in June 2009, it took divers two years to find the black box.

Jeanniot is now on the advisory board of a Toronto-based firm that has built a live-streamed black box system. When a plane experiences an irregular event, the system can send streaming data off the aircraft to one of the satellites and then down to ground-based servers, where the message is interpreted and sent to the airline. It seems necessary that the loss of MH370 and other similar cases wake more people up to the fact that the tools being used at this stage are inadequate for dealing with emergency situations, Jeanniot says. He also estimates that if this technology had been on board the missing Malaysian Airlines flight and live-streaming for the estimated seven hours after the flight first experienced a problem, it would have cost about $3,000. While there is widespread approval of a live-streamed black box system, most airlines see its cost prohibitive.

{"answer": 2, "choices": ["throw away old materials", "reduce the cost of production", "make more durable products", "replace their products frequently"], "question": "The consumer  plays a very important role in the global efforts to reduce C02emissions . Households use one third of the final energy and produce around two thirds of city waste in the European Union. Besides,housing, food,and private transport make up almost 80% of environmental pressures. Therefore there's no doubt that consumers can make a real difference in fighting climate change. To direct consumers towards more environmentally-friendly decisions,we need clear and simple instructions to guide consumption behavior. Actually, two thirds of consumers find it hard to figure out which products are better for the environment, for 58% Europeans think that many businesses just pretend to be green so as to charge higher prices. Thus industry should work harder to give consumers more information about the carbon footprint of their product. For example, inform customers of products made from materials that are recycled,renewable, and/or less carbon-intensive.  People prefer high-quality products that will last long and won't go out of style, though they might sometimes cost more, especially in time of crisis. Firms that make durable  or recyclable products cause people to behave more responsibly, which may help put an end to our \"throw-way\" culture. However, it is not enough to remind people of green products. It's more important to direct people to follow a practical lifestyle model. Regulations alone cannot achieve this purpose. We call for good business communities to create a loyal group of \"sustainable consumers\". It's advised that companies had better   _  especially in the time of crisis.", "subject": ""}

Under Urzua's leadership, the men stretched an emergency food supply meant to last just 48 hours over two and a half weeks, taking tiny sips of milk and bites of fish every other day.He described the difficulties of the first days, saying that it took about three hours for the dust to settle before the men could inspect where tons of collapsed rock sealed off   the main way out. When the rescuers first made contact by drilling a narrow hole into their refuge  , the miners were so excited that everyone wanted to hug the drill hammer.After the collapse, Urzua was the first to speak to Pinera and to urge him not to let him and his men down. \"Don't leave us alone,\" he asked the president, who assured the workers that they would not be abandoned, telling them he would do everything he could to get them back to the surface.

Some medical experts say light drinking may even be good for your health, especially for the heart. But they say such health benefits should be compared to the many health risks connected with alcohol use. Some research suggests that having one to two drinks of alcohol a day may offer some health benefits. Several large studies have shown that this type of moderate  drinking may lower the risk of heart disease and other diseases. A study last year suggested that drinking small amounts of red wine may help lower the risk of breast cancer in women. Researchers at Medical Center in California studied 36 women. Each woman drank a glass of red or white wine every day for almost a month. Researchers collected blood samples from the women two times a month to measure their hormone  levels. The next month the women who drank red wine were told to drink white wine instead. The white wine drinkers were told to drink red wine. The researchers found that the women who drank red wine had lower levels of the female hormone than the white wine drinkers. They said red grapes have chemicals that may help to lower the risk of breast cancer. However, recent studies suggested that even small amounts of alcohol may generally increase the risk of breast cancer in women. They found that women who drink four small glasses of wine a week increase their risk of breast cancer by 15 percent. Many studies have examined the harmful effects of alcohol use on the body.

And for women of all ages, it's no more than 7 drinks in a week and no more than 2 drinks in a day.\" She says too much alcohol use has been linked to liver diseases, and many other cancers.

Until now,it has been widely assumed that the kind of mental ability that allows us to solve new problems without having any relevant previous experience--what psychologists call fluid intelligence--is innate and cannot be taught(though people can raise their grades on tests of it by practicing). But in the new study,researchers describe a method for improving this skill,along with experiments to prove it works. The key, researchers found, was carefully structured training in working memory--the kind that allows memorization of a telephone number just long enough to dial it.This type of memory is closely related to fluid intelligence,so the researchers reasoned that improving it might lead to improvements in fluid intelligence. First they measured fluid intelligence of volunteers using standard tests.Then they trained each in a complicated memory task--the child's card game,in which they had to recall a card they saw and heard.During the course, they needed to ignore irrelevant items, monitor ongoing performance,manage two tasks at the same time and connect related items to one another in space and time.

Buying e week's groceries is tiring. You want to get it over and done with quickly, so you head for the nearest supermarket, you find everything you need under one roof, and you feel glad that those days of going in and out of different shops in the high street are over. Supermarkets seem to be a big plus. There is a downside, though. In the UK 90% of all the food people consume is bought at 5 different supermarket chains. This makes these companies extremely powerful, which lets them use their huge buying power to squeeze small suppliers to get the best deal. Milk is a good example. Supermarkets like to use things like milk, which is the top of almost everyone's shopping list to attract customers. To offer the lowest price possible to the consumer, the supermarkets force dairy farmers to sell milk at less than the cost of production. Supermarkets guarantee their good profits while farmers are left struggling to make ends meet, and the taxpayer pays to support the system without even knowing it. It would be nice if local grocers supported local agriculture. But for the big supermarkets this just doesn't make sense. Supermarkets don't want little farmers thinking they can decide prices. So supermarkets have started a global search for the cheapest possible agricultural produce. In many supermarkets it is difficult to find anything which is produced locally. UK farmers used to grow a lot of apples. Not anymore. In 1999 36% of apples were imported. By 2015 the figure had risen to 80% and the domestic production of apples had fallen by two thirds. The consumer might just be happy to get a reasonably priced meal made up of foods from Thailand, Spain, Italy and Zambia, but we should also bear in mind the Influence on local producers. Then there's packaging. Supermarkets like everything to be packed and wrapped so it can be piled neatly on shelves. Supermarkets produce nearly 10 million tons of waste packaging in the UK every year, of which less 5%is recycled. Some supermarkets make sure that large recycling bins are obvious in their car parks, showing that they are environment-friendly. But that is just an image. When a new supermarket is planned there are claims about the number of new jobs that will be created. Unfortunately, the number of jobs lost in the area is larger than the number of new positions in the supermarket. On average each new supermarket leads to the loss of 276 jobs. However, the modern world is all about shopping, and the freedom to buy whatever you what, so it would be impossible to stop people shopping at some particular kind of shop.

It may wash away the inner confusion you feel right after being forced to make a choice between two appealing choices, according to a new study.

It turns out that Shakespeare was really onto something when he imagined Lady Macbeth trying to clean her conscience by rubbing invisible bloodstains from her hands. A few years ago, scientists asked people to describe a past wrong act. If people were then given a chance to clean their hands, they later expressed less guilt than people who hadn't cleaned. This finding interested W. S. Lee, a researcher. \"Anything from the past, any kind of negative emotional experiences, might be washed away,\" says Lee.

In the winter its fur is white or creamy white. It has a long bushy tail, a short nose and small, curled back ears. It has short legs and thick fur.

Because its legs are so short and its ears and nose are small, they are less exposed to the cold. The arctic fox also has thick fur and hair on its paw pads that help keep it warm. When the arctic fox is sleeping, it protects its nose from the cold by curling its bushy tail around its body. The arctic fox is about three feet long and weighs between five and fifteen pounds. Males are larger than females. Diet The arctic fox is an opportunities eater. It will eat just about whatever it comes across. It eats small mammals like lemmings   and it also eats birds, insects and eggs. In fact, in the winter it often follows polar bears and wolves and eats their leftover kill. In the summer the arctic fox will carry extra food to its den and store it under rocks to eat later. The arctic fox sometimes even makes its own freezer by digging a hole in the permafrost   and storing its food there. A major source of food for the arctic fox is the lemming. In fact, the arctic fox population often peaks every four years in a cycle that follows lemming population changes. Life Cycle The arctic fox mates between February and June. The female builds a new den and gives birth to between six and twelve dark--furred kits. Both the female and the male will take care of the young kits.

Doing the paperwork after his parents' death was a challenge. \"When my time comes, I wonder if my children will even know what paper is,\" he says. As a software developer, his virtual property is both valuable and vital to his business. That reflects a problem. Online lives have increasing economic and emotional value. But testamentary   laws offer confusing and incomplete ways of bequeathing and inheriting   them. Digital property may include software, websites, downloaded content, online gaming identities, social-media accounts and even e-mails. In Britain alone holdings of digital music may be worth over PS9 billion ($14 billion). A fifth of respondents to a Chinese local-newspaper survey said they had over 5,000 yuan($790) of digital property. And value does not lie only in money.\"Anyone with kids under 14 years old probably has two prints of them and the rest are in online galleries,\"says Nathan Lustig of Entrustet, a company that helps people manage digital property. Service providers have different rules--and few state them clearly in their terms and conditions. Many give users a personal right to use an account, but nobody else, even after death. Facebook allows relatives to close an account or turn it into a memorial page. Gmail (run by Google) will provide copies of e-mails to an executor  . Music downloaded via iTunes is held under a license which can be abolished on death. Apple declined to comment on the record on this or other policies.
