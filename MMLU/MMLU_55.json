She has bought a bicycle and is worried about security. Her friend, Kate, found this article and sent it to her. www.zxxk.com Introduction A lot of crime is against bicycles. About 150,000 bicycles are stolen every year and most are never found. You can prevent this happening by following a few careful steps. Basic Security Do not leave your bicycle in out-of-the-way places. Always lock your bicycle when you leave. Secure it to lampposts or trees. Take off smaller parts and take them with you, for example lights and saddles . Locks Get a good lock. There are many different types in the shop. Buy one that has been tested against attack. Ask for a recommendation from a bike shop. Marking Security marking your bike can act as a deterrent  to a thief. It can also help the police find your bicycle. It should be clearly written and include your postcode and your house or flat number. This will provide a simple way to identify your bicycle. Registration There are a number of companies who will mark your bicycle for you. They will then put your registration number and personal details on their computer database. Then if your bicycle is found it will be easy to contact you. Finally Keep a record of the bicycle yourself: its make, model and registration number. You can even take a photograph of it, this will prove the bicycle belongs to you. The main purpose of this article is   _  .", "subject": ""}

Perhaps yes. Scientists have found the gene that determines skin color1.     The gene comes in two versions, one of which is found in 99 percent of Europeans. The other is found in 93 to 100 percent of Africans, researchers at Pennsylvania State University report in the latest issue of science.     Scientists have changed the color1 of a dark-striped zebrafish to uniform gold by inserting a version of the pigment gene into a young fish. As with humans, zebrafish skin color1 is determined by pigment cells, which contain melanin  . The number, size and darkness of melanin per pigment cell determine skin color1.     It appears that, like the golden zebrafish, light-skinned Europeans also have a mutation   in the gene for melanin production. This results in less pigmented skin. However, Keith Cheng, leader of the research team, points out that the mutation is different in human and zebrafish genes.     Humans acquired dark skin in Africa about 1.5 million years ago to protect bodies from ultra-violet rays of the sun , which can cause skin cancer. But when modern humans leave Africa to live in northern latitudes, they need more sunlight on their skin to produce vitamin D. So the related gene changes, according to Cheng.     \"Asians have the same version of the gene as Africans, so they probably acquired their light skin through the action of some other gene that affects skin color1,\" said Cheng.

I'm sure that grandparents are waiting for their kids' and grandchildren's visit. If your holiday schedule is tightly packed, then you should find at least two hours to pay a visit to your grandparents. We often forget about three magic words \"l love you\". Love is not a sign of weakness and our grandparents deserve to hear these pleasant and healing words. Don't feel shy of showing and proving your love. Your hug and a frank smile can be the best cure for different diseases to your dear grandparents. Old people are very sensible creatures. They need both physical and mental supports. Younger people should be patient enough to pay attention, hear out and don't let their grandparents feel too old, lonely and useless. There're hundreds of ideas on how to make something good and useful for your grandparents. The best one is to bring a fresh and bushy Christmas tree to their house. Do your best to decorate it with lights and ribbons. Encourage your grandparents to do it together. Unfortunately, people are like candles. The light of their eyes can die out in a moment. Chances are high that their hearts will stop one day. Why don't we begin to value things before we lose them? I know that not everyone can answer this challenging question.

The land is becoming salty. It is a big problem for the small country which has more than 155 million people because growing crops is the most common way Bangladeshis support themselves. Farmers in the country are learning to grow vegetables in so-called \"vertical gardens. \" The soil in these gardens is better because heavy rains have removed much of the salt. Shobitha Debna is a 35-year-old farmer in the village Chandipur is able to grow hundreds of kilograms of vegetables each season in her small garden. This kind of farming is new in Chandipur.

Jobs were hard to come by, but I was up for almost any challenge. At last, I taught in a special school where students have severe learning and behavioral difficulties. Another teacher and I had spent weeks teaching the children appropriate behavior for public outings. Unexpectedly, only a few students, including Kyle, had not earned the privilege of going. He was determined to make his disappointment known. In the corridor  between classrooms, he began screaming, cursing, spitting, and swinging at anything within striking distance. Once his outburst died down, he did what he'd done when he was angry at all his other schools, at home, even once at a juvenile detention center. He ran. People watched in disbelief as Kyle dashed straight into the heavy morning traffic in front of the school. I heard someone shout, \"Call the police!\" But I ran after him. Kyle was at least a foot taller than me. And he was fast. His older brothers were track stars at the nearby high school. But I could run long distances without tiring. I would at least be able to keep him in my sight and know he was alive. After several blocks of running directly into oncoming traffic, Kyle slowed his pace. He took a sharp left.

Kyle stood still and watched me approach. I had no idea what I was going to say or do, but I kept walking closer. He opened his mouth to speak when a police car pulled up, abruptly filling the space between Kyle and me. The school principal and an officer got out. They spoke calmly to Kyle, who willingly climbed into the back of the vehicle. I couldn't hear what was said, but I didn't take my eyes off Kyle's face, even as they drove away. I couldn't help but feel that I had failed him, that I should have done or said more, that I should have fixed the situation. I shared my feelings with a speech therapist who was familiar with Kyle's history. \"No one ever ran after him before, Rachel,\" she said. \"No one. They just let him go.\" Things changed the day he ran and I ran after him, even though I didn't have the right words, even though I wasn't able to save him from the mess he was in.

I would at least be able to keep him in my sight and know he was alive. After several blocks of running directly into oncoming traffic, Kyle slowed his pace. He took a sharp left. Standing next to a trash bin, Kyle bent over with his hands on his knees. I must have looked ridiculous. But his was not a look of fear. I saw his body relax. He did not attempt to run again. Kyle stood still and watched me approach. I had no idea what I was going to say or do, but I kept walking closer. He opened his mouth to speak when a police car pulled up, abruptly filling the space between Kyle and me. The school principal and an officer got out. They spoke calmly to Kyle, who willingly climbed into the back of the vehicle. I couldn't hear what was said, but I didn't take my eyes off Kyle's face, even as they drove away. I couldn't help but feel that I had failed him, that I should have done or said more, that I should have fixed the situation. I shared my feelings with a speech therapist who was familiar with Kyle's history. \"No one ever ran after him before, Rachel,\" she said. \"No one. They just let him go.\" Things changed the day he ran and I ran after him, even though I didn't have the right words, even though I wasn't able to save him from the mess he was in.

I'd left my family and friends in Indiana, the beloved state where I'd lived most of my life. My new home in Florida was thousands of miles away from anything I knew. It was hot--all the time. Jobs were hard to come by, but I was up for almost any challenge. At last, I taught in a special school where students have severe learning and behavioral difficulties. Another teacher and I had spent weeks teaching the children appropriate behavior for public outings. Unexpectedly, only a few students, including Kyle, had not earned the privilege of going. He was determined to make his disappointment known. In the corridor  between classrooms, he began screaming, cursing, spitting, and swinging at anything within striking distance. Once his outburst died down, he did what he'd done when he was angry at all his other schools, at home, even once at a juvenile detention center. He ran.

You cannot cheat. If you try to take a shortcut, you will affect the taste,\" he says. \"It is also what I appreciate in my job ---- direct communication with my customers.\"  At just 23, Briol was appointed chef of Belle-Vue in September, when his enthusiasm and inspiration won recognition.  \"I am so pleased to welcome Marc to lead the culinary   team at Belle-Vue.

People respect food, which is not always done in Europe.  \"In China, if you eat something, it is because it is healthy for your body.\"  As for the cooking, he says, it is not easy to get raw materials for a European restaurant in Shenzhen.  \"It took me about a month to get the fish I want for my cooking. We had to call Shanghai or Hong Kong to ship the food here,\" he says. \"When I worked in London, the process was much easier.\"  He gets much of his inspiration from food blogs and friends.  \"About 80 percent of my friends come from restaurants, and they are bakers, chefs. We will meet and talk to get new ideas for food.\" Other sources of inspiration are traveling and cookbooks.

If you try to take a shortcut, you will affect the taste,\" he says. \"It is also what I appreciate in my job ---- direct communication with my customers.\"  At just 23, Briol was appointed chef of Belle-Vue in September, when his enthusiasm and inspiration won recognition.  \"I am so pleased to welcome Marc to lead the culinary   team at Belle-Vue. His creativity and passion will bring new inspiration to the restaurant, and create exciting dining experiences that are approachable and fun,\" says Martin Riehl, executive chef of the hotel.  Briol creates and combines classic dishes with his own understanding and his signature dishes are featured in the Best of Belle-Vue selection. Most of the dishes are presented in two color1s ---- green and red.  \"It is a nice contrast with the white plate at the moment. And it reminds me of something happy and merry.\"  The color1s are updated according to season, and also on request from regular customers.  Although Briol has only been in Shenzhen about three months, he has fallen in love with Cantonese food.  \"I love dim sum ---- all the steamed vegetables, chicken soup and black tea.\"  One interesting thing about Shenzhen is how people treat food, he says. \"If you go to the local market, you will see things such as snakes, which would belong to the zoo back in my country.\"  He says that in China, everything has a reason. People respect food, which is not always done in Europe.  \"In China, if you eat something, it is because it is healthy for your body.\"  As for the cooking, he says, it is not easy to get raw materials for a European restaurant in Shenzhen.  \"It took me about a month to get the fish I want for my cooking. We had to call Shanghai or Hong Kong to ship the food here,\" he says. \"When I worked in London, the process was much easier.\"  He gets much of his inspiration from food blogs and friends.  \"About 80 percent of my friends come from restaurants, and they are bakers, chefs. We will meet and talk to get new ideas for food.\" Other sources of inspiration are traveling and cookbooks.

According to a recent discovery, the shape of ears could provide a reliable new way of identifying people at airports. Researchers discovered that ears of each person have a unique shape and they have created a system that can scan them. The ear scanning technique uses a technology called image ray transform that highlights all the tubular structures  of the ear and measures them. Professor Mark Nixon, a computer scientist who led the team from the University of Southampton, believes ear scanning could take place as passengers walk through security gates, for example, by placing cameras on either side to record an image of their ears. Comparing the results against a database of ear shapes, the new system could help airport security workers instantly identify passengers. Nixon and his team tested 252 images of different ears and found the system was able to match each ear to a separate image held in its database with 99 percent accuracy. Besides ear scanning, there have been other systems developed for identity recognition.  \"With facial recognition, the systems are often confused by crows feet  and other signs of ageing,\" Nixon said. \"Your ears, however, age very gracefully.

A global survey has found that most people can't live without their mobiles, never leave home without them and, if given a choice, would rather lose their wallet.[: _ ] Calling mobile phones the \"remote control\" for life, market research firm Synovate's poll said cell phones are so ubiquitous that by last year more humans owned one than did not. Three-quarters of the more than 8,000 respondents polled online in 11 countries said they take their phone with them everywhere, which Russians and Singaporeans the most attached. More than a third also said they couldn't live without their phone, topped by Taiwanese and again Singaporeans, while one in four would find it harder to replace the mobile than their purse. Some two thirds of respondents go to bed with their phones nearby and can't switch them off, even though they want to, because they're afraid they'll miss something. Mobiles have changed the nature of relationships, with the survey finding a fifth of all respondents set up first dates via text and almost the same number use the same method to end a love affair. Apart from the obvious calling and SMS-ing, the top three features people use regularly on their mobile phones globally are the alarm clock, the camera and the games. As for email and Internet access, 17 percent of respondents said they checked their inboxes or surfed the Web on their phones, led by those in the United States and Britain. One in 10 respondents log onto  social networking websites such as Facebook and MySpace regularly via mobile, again led by Britain and the United States.[:Zxxk.Com] Not everyone is tech savvy , however,37 percent of respondents said they don't know how to use all the functions on their phone.

Actually, competitive cheerleading is a sport. A sport is a \"physical activity against/with an opponent, governed by rules and conditions under which a winner is declared, and the primary purpose of the competition is a comparison of the relative skills of the participants. \"Because cheerleading follows these guidelines, it is a sport. Competitive cheerleading includes lots of physical activities. Like gymnasts, cheerleaders must  learn  to  tumble    .  They perform lifts and tosses.  This is where the \"flied' are thrown in the air, held by \" _ \" in different positions that require strength and cooperation with other teammates. Just as basketball and football have guidelines for competitive play, so does competitive cheerleading. The whole routine has to be completed in less than 3 minutes and 15 seconds and the cheerleaders are required to stay within a certain area. Competitive cheerleaders' goal is to be the best.  Just like gymnasts, they are awarded points for difficulty, creativity and sharpness. The more difficult a mount, the sharper the motions, the better the score.  Cheerleading is a team sport so without cooperation, first place is out of reach. Cheerleading is the number-one cause of serious sports injuries to women.  Emergency room visits for cheerleading are five times the number of those for any other sport, partially because they do not wear protective gear. While many athletes are equipped with hip pads or helmets, smiling cheerleaders are tossed into the air and spiral down into the arms of trusted teammates. The fliersmust remain tight at all times so that their bases can catch them safely. Also, because cheerleading is not yet recognized as a sport by many schools, neither proper matting nor high enough ceilings are provided to ensure safety.

Actually, competitive cheerleading is a sport. A sport is a \"physical activity against/with an opponent, governed by rules and conditions under which a winner is declared, and the primary purpose of the competition is a comparison of the relative skills of the participants. \"Because cheerleading follows these guidelines, it is a sport. Competitive cheerleading includes lots of physical activities. Like gymnasts, cheerleaders must  learn  to  tumble    .  They perform lifts and tosses.  This is where the \"flied' are thrown in the air, held by \" _ \" in different positions that require strength and cooperation with other teammates. Just as basketball and football have guidelines for competitive play, so does competitive cheerleading. The whole routine has to be completed in less than 3 minutes and 15 seconds and the cheerleaders are required to stay within a certain area. Competitive cheerleaders' goal is to be the best.  Just like gymnasts, they are awarded points for difficulty, creativity and sharpness. The more difficult a mount, the sharper the motions, the better the score.  Cheerleading is a team sport so without cooperation, first place is out of reach. Cheerleading is the number-one cause of serious sports injuries to women.  Emergency room visits for cheerleading are five times the number of those for any other sport, partially because they do not wear protective gear. While many athletes are equipped with hip pads or helmets, smiling cheerleaders are tossed into the air and spiral down into the arms of trusted teammates. The fliersmust remain tight at all times so that their bases can catch them safely. Also, because cheerleading is not yet recognized as a sport by many schools, neither proper matting nor high enough ceilings are provided to ensure safety. Instead, the girls use whatever space is available. More recognition of competitive cheerleading as a sport would decrease the number of injuries.

One thing that might cause you not to accept yourself is over-generalizing about something you've done that you don't like.For example, if you fail a test you might generalize and say, \"I'm really a stupid person.\" When you do this you are making a statement about all of you all of the time and not just about this one situation at this time. Instead, you might decide that your grade on this test in this subject at this time was indeed poor, and then go on to decide what you want to do about your poor grade, if anything. Getting stuck in over-generalizing discourages you from taking steps that might allow you to do better on the next exam and to build an expectation of future failure.  Having standards that are impossibly high is a second way you can not accept yourself. It may not come as a surprise to you that most of us are more demanding of ourselves than we are of others. Somehow we can tolerate the fact that other people fail, that they aren't always kind, that they've done things they aren't proud of, but we have difficulty accepting those very human aspects of ourselves. The need to be perfect is another way to set yourself up for failure and enhance the feeling that you are not acceptable. We all make mistakes. Accepting less than perfection simply means recognizing the limitations natural in being born a human being. Learn to value who you are rather than who you could become. Wouldn't it be overpowering if we always had to do what we imagine we could do? Nobody has the time and energy to do all of that.

Dave Murbach needs 11 months. Almost every day of every year, Murbach's thoughts turn to vision of a perfectly shaped evergreen tree that will take everyone's breath away. Murbach is the man responsible for finding the towering tree that makes more attractive Manhattan's Rockefeller Center each Christmas season. \"I'm always looking for a tree,\" the center's chief gardener says. \"I look for it even when I go to the beach in the summer. It' s like a homework assignment hanging over your head.\" And if he gets it wrong, there's nothing hiding it. \"Every day it's up, 400,000 people go by, and 2.5 million people watch the lighting celebration on television,\"he says. This year's tree, a 74-foot Nomy spruce   from Richfield, Ohio, flown to New York on the world's largest cargo plane, was lighted on December 2. The arrival of the tree leads in the Christmas season in New York -- a tradition dating back to 1931, when the workers building Rockefeller Center put up a small tree with ornaments  . The search for the next year's tree starts soon after the old tree is chopped up for wood chips and horse-jumping logs. Murbach has three standards: The tree must be at least 65 feet high, at least 35 feet across and leaves dense   enough not to see through. That's not as simple as it sounds. Though forests are full of evergreens, few get enough sunlight or space to fill out. And branches in snow regions often break under the weight, making trees unbalanced. Back at the office, he sorts through hundreds of letters from people offering their trees, many addressed simply to \"Mr. Christmas Tree Man.\" Though there was occasional anxiety attack and sleepless night, Murbach knows the effect the tree has on people: \"It's for bringing people together, attempting to bring together people you love. That's what I hope it sets off.\"  But Murbach says he's always too worn out to celebrate Christmas.

Though forests are full of evergreens, few get enough sunlight or space to fill out. And branches in snow regions often break under the weight, making trees unbalanced. Back at the office, he sorts through hundreds of letters from people offering their trees, many addressed simply to \"Mr. Christmas Tree Man.\" Though there was occasional anxiety attack and sleepless night, Murbach knows the effect the tree has on people: \"It's for bringing people together, attempting to bring together people you love.

Can I trust this person? 2. Can I respect this person? Your level of trustworthiness, or warmth, is the most important factor in how people initially admire you, Cuddy says-yet many mistakenly believe that the second factor,characterised as competence, is more important.\"From an evolutionary aspect,\"Cuddy writes,\"it is more important to our survival to know whether a person deserves our trust.\" While displaying competence is certainly beneficial, particularly in a work setting, Cuddy warns that focusing on winning people's respect, while failing to win their trust, can backfire-a common problem for young professionals attempting to make a good impression early on in their careers. \"If someone you're trying to influence doesn't trust you, you're not going to get very far\", Cuddy says, \"A warm, trustworthy person who is also strong elicits  admiration, but only after you've established trust does your strength become a gift rather than a threat.\" In Cuddy's book she also explains some of the science that can help you spot a liar. When a person is lying there is likely to be differences between what they are saying and what they are doing, she suggests. \"Lying is hard work,\" she writes, \"We're telling one story while suppressing another, and most of us are experiencing psychological guilt about doing this, which we're also trying suppress.

{"answer": 3, "choices": ["10.", "13.", "15.", "25."], "question": "\"Beating is a sign of affection, cursing  is a sign of love.\" Many may not expect to hear the words of the old Chinese saying in these modern Times-- with parents wealthier and better educated than they have ever been--but experts say they still ring true. Today,it seems,Chinese parents are more likely to send their children to precollege military academies in the United States in the hope that some tough love will pave the way to success. \"Good education doesn't mean letting your children enjoy privileges, especially our boys.\" said Song Wenming,an entrepreneur  in Jinhua,East China's Zhejiang province. \"They should be raised in tough conditions to know what to fight for in the future.\" In August,Song sent his 17yearold son to Valley Forge Military Academy (VFMA) in Pennsylvania. _ . Statistics show that an increasing number of Chinese students have been registering with such academies. A few years ago, there were no Chinese students at Valley Forge. Today,there are 28.\"All of the Chinese students at Valley Forge came from wealthy families;some of them were spoiled.\" said Jennifer Myers, director of marketing and communications at the school. Song's only son, Song Siyu, had a rocky start during his first six weeks at the school. The teenager said he went to the school voluntarily but did not expect it to be as difficult. Now, three months later, he has perfected the art of taking a bath in 35 seconds, finishing a meal without looking at his food, and making his bed with precision. He can even take criticism,no matter how unreasonable. \"The training is hard but I know it is good for selfdevelopment of individuals.\" said SongSiyu. \"The endless training and scolding are just ways to build up our character;they are not personal.\" But his enthusiasm is not universal. Ten of the 13 Chinese students who joined the academy this year have transferred to other schools. But for those who stick to it, there is a reward for all the hard work. How many Chinese students are there at Valley Forge before this year?", "subject": ""}

As people crazily search for a solution to this problem, they often try some of the popular fad  diets being offered. Many people see fad diets as harmless ways of losing weight, and they are grateful to have them. Unfortunately, not only don't fad diets usually do the trick, but they can actually be dangerous for your health. Although permanent weight loss is the goal, few are able to achieve it. Experts estimate that 95 percent of dieters return to their starting weight, or even add weight. While the irresponsible or unwise use of fad diets can bring some initial results, long-term results are very rare.[:**] Nonetheless, people who are bored with the difficulties of changing their eating habits often turn to fad diets. Rather than being moderate, fad diets involve extreme dietary changes. They advise eating only one type of food, or they prohibit other types of foods entirely. This results in a situation where a person's body doesn't get all the vitamins and other things that it needs to stay healthy. One popular fad diet recommends eating lots of meat and animal products, while nearly eliminating carbohydrates . A scientific study from Britain found that this diet is very high in fat. According to the study, the increase of damaging fats in the blood can lead to heart disease and, in extreme cases, kidney failure. Furthermore, diets that are too low in carbohydrates can cause the body to use its own muscle for energy. The less muscle you have, the less food you use up, and the result is slower weight loss. Veteran  dieters may well ask at this point, \"What is the ideal diet?\" Well, to some extent, it depends on the individual. A United States government agency has determined that to change your eating habits requires changing your psychology of eating, and everyone has a different psychology. That being said, the British study quoted above recommends a diet that is high in carbohydrates and high in fiber, with portions of fatty foods kept low.

Does a plastic continent exist? Yes, a plastic continent does exist and was discovered by Captain Charles Moore a decade ago. The plastic continent is twice the size of Britain and it is the region between the Hawaii Islands and California in the central Pacific Ocean. One of the causes of the lack of marine life in this region is due to pollution and pollutants are none other than plastics. Captain Charles Moore believes plastic waste started accumulating in the 1950s. The plastic continent is the man-made continent of floating plastic waste. The fisher men and the sailors have avoided this region for years. The reasons are: 1. There are no fish here because of the lack of nutrients. 2. The zone also lacks the wind that is essential for sailing. To do research on the ocean pollution, Captain Moore founded Algalita Marine Research Foundation. Other organizations such as Greenpeace supported his cause. The reports of The United Nations Environment Program show that millions of seabirds and marine animals are dying due to the invasion of plastics. The waste plastics can be recycled, but in fact they are being thrown into the oceans. The marine animals mistake these for food and eat them.

During the early 20th century the Samoan Islands were divided by Germany, Great Britain and the USA. Tutuila and Aunu'u islands were claimed by the USA. The western islands became German Samoa.

But all that changed this week, with the official launch of a project first proposed a century ago.

All of our hard work didn't make me feel confident by the time the show came. One girl named Becky rode a big brown horse in the race events. She always won the blue ribbons. I sat at the gate and sweated all out while I watched Becky and her horse charge through the court and finish in first place. My turn finally came. At the signal, we dashed toward the first fence, jumped over it without trouble and raced on to the next one. Cowboy then flew over the second, third and fourth fences like a bird and I turned him toward the finish line. No cheers filled the air. The end of our run was met with surprised silence. Cowboy and I had beaten Becky and her fancy horse by two seconds. I gained much more than a blue ribbon that day. At thirteen, I realized that no matter what the odds, I'd always come out a winner if I wanted something badly enough to work for it. I can be the owner of my fate.

It aims to help with achieving a greater understanding of the behavior of children through an understanding of their minds. It deals with children who range from the prenatal stage right up to the stage of adolescence. The psychologist Jean Piaget (1896-1980) has been credited with making a major breakthrough in this area when he put forward his idea that children were not actually less intelligent than adults, rather they just thought in a different way. Preciously the development of children right from birth through to adulthood was an area that was almost completely _ . In fact very little work was done in this area. However, interest in this field has now developed to the point of being one of the most debated of all the areas of psychology. Despite popular belief that factors such as genetics or personal characteristics are the only determining factors that influence a youth's behavior, this is not in fact the case. In reality, development actually includes many more factors than those contained within an individual. Factors such as environment, which can include social relationships and the surrounding culture, also play important roles. Relationships with both peers and adults will no doubt affect how children think and learn, and therefore develop. These relationships can include those that are found not only within families but also in schools and peer groups. Culturally speaking, this factor will contribute greatly to how children develop their personality concerning the values they end up holding (perhaps for a lifetime) as well as how they view such things as traditions and customs. Nowadays, psychologists have agreed that a child's psychology is both unique and highly complex. However, there are debates on many different points in this field and many viewpoints exist.

Pretty girl screams: \"Dad!\" Crash. Shatter. Boom. Crash. Shatter. Boom. Silly dialogue. \"Dad!!!\" Crash. Shatter. Boom. What? Oh, sorry. We were falling into a trance there. Which is, dear moviegoer, what may happen to you during Michael Bay's Transformers: Age of Extinction, the fourth Transformers film and lasts 165 minutes, which is precariously   close to the three-hour mark that Bay undoubtedly will reach--by our sophisticated calculations, and at the current growth rate, with his sixth installment . But let's not get ahead of ourselves. Despite what you've just read, this film will likely be a massive hit because by now, if you're buying a Transformers ticket, you surely know what you're getting into, and you want more, more, more. And Bay is the Master of More. Or just take it from the 11-year-old sitting  next to me, who reserved any audible judgment--he, too was in a trance, though maybe from sugar intake--until the moment he saw a Transformer become a dinosaur. Overwhelmed by the pairing, he proclaimed, \"That's the sickest thing I've ever seen in my life.\" It was as if peanut butter and jelly had been tasted together for the first time. This time, there's a whole new human cast. Most important, Mark Wahlberg has replaced Shia LaBeouf as well, Main Human Guy. A significant part of the movie also takes place in China--clearly a nod to the franchise's huge market in the country. In any case, we begin in Paris, Texas, where Cade Yeager (Wahlberg), a struggling inventor, is desperatlely seeking a big discovery. He's also a widowed dad, and super-protective (as the movie constantly reminds us) of his high-school daughter, Tessa (Nicola Peltz, blond and pretty and ineffective, though the one-note script does her no favors). One day, Cade buys a rusty old truck. Examining it back home, he soon discovers it's none other than Optimus Prime, the Autobot hero, seriously damaged. As Cade works on fixing him up, his assistant, witty surfer-dude Lucas, has the dumb idea of calling the authorities. What he doesn't know is that the government is plotting to destroy all remaining Autobots in favor of a man-made army of Transformers. So now, it's evil humans that pitted against the trustworthy Autobots. So much for gratitude. There's also a subplot involving Tessa and her secret boyfriend, Shane (Jack Reynor, underused), whose Irish accent leads Cade to dismissively call him \"Lucky Charms\"--at least until the two bond in battle. The obvious question: Is it too much for its own good? Bay is vey talented at all things visual. The 3-D works well and the robots look great. But the final confrontation   alone lasts close to an hour. At some point, you may find yourself simply in a daze, unable to absorb any further action into your brain.

He was shivering, his face was white, and he walked slowly as though it ached to move. \"What's the matter, Schatz?\" \"I've got a headache.\" \"You better go back to bed.\" \"No. I'm all right.\" \"You go to bed. I'll see you when I'm dressed.\" But when I came downstairs he was dressed, sitting by the fire, looking a very sick and miserable boy of nine years. When I put my hand on his forehead I knew he had a fever. \"You go up to bed,\" I said, \"You're sick.\" \"I'm all right,\" he said. When the doctor came he took the boy's temperature. \"What's is it?\" I asked him. \"One hundred and two.\" Downstairs, the doctor left three different medicines in different colored capsules with instructions for giving them. One was to bring down the fever, another a purgative , the third to overcome an acid condition. The germs of influenza can only exist in an acid condition, he explained. He seemed to know all about influenza and said there was nothing to worry about if the fever did not go above one hundred and four degrees. This was a light epidemic(;) of flu and there was no danger if you avoided pneumonia . Back in the room I wrote the boy's temperature down and made a note of the time to give the various capsules. \"Do you want me to read to you?\" \"All right. If you want to, \" said the boy. His face was very white and there were dark areas under his eyes. He lay still in the bed and seemed very detached(;)from what was going on. I read aloud from Howard Pyle's Book of Pirates ;but I could see he was not following what I was reading. \"How do you feel, Schatz?\" I asked him. \"Just the same, so far,\" he said. I sat at the foot of the bed and read to myself while I waited for it to be time to give another capsule. It would have been natural for him to go to sleep, but when I looked up he was looking at the foot of the bed, looking very strangely. \"Why don't you try to sleep? I'll wake you up for the medicine.\" \"I'd rather stay awake.\" After a while he said to me, \"You don't have to stay in here with me, Papa, if it bothers you.\" \"It doesn't bother me.\" \"No, I mean you don't have to stay if it's going to bother you.\" I thought perhaps he was a little lightheaded and after giving him the prescribed capsules at eleven o'clock I went out with my gun and the young hunting dog....I killed two quail , and missed five, and started back pleased to have found a covey of quail close to the house and happy there were so many left to find on another day. At the house they said the boy had refused to let anyone come into the room. \"You can't come in,\" he said. \"You mustn't get what I have.\" I went up to him and found him in exactly the position I had left him, white-faced, but with the tops of his cheeks flushed by the fever, staring still, as he had stared, at the foot of the bed. I took his temperature. \"What is it?\" \"Something like a hundred,\" I said. It was one hundred and two and four tenths. \"It was a hundred and two,\" he said. \"Who said so?\" \"The doctor.\" \"Your temperature is all right,\" I said. \"It's nothing to worry about.\" \"I don't worry,\" he said, \"but I can't keep from thinking.\" \"Don't think,\" I said. \"Just take it easy.\" \"I'm taking it easy,\" he said and looked straight ahead, He was evidently holding tight onto himself about something. \"Take this with water.\" \"Do you think it will do any good?\" \"Of course it will.\" I sat down and opened the Pirate book and began to read, but I could see he was not following, so I stopped. \"About what time do you think I'm going to die?\" he asked. \"What?\" \"About how long will it be before I die?\" \"You aren't going to die. What's the matter with you? \" \"Oh, yes, I am, I heard him say a hundred and two.\" \"People don't die with a fever of one hundred and two. That's a silly way to talk.\" \"I know they do. At school in France the boys told me you can't live with forty-four degrees. I've got a hundred and two.\" He had been waiting to die all day, ever since nine o'clock in the morning. \"You poor Schatz,\" I said. \"Poor old Schatz. It's like miles and kilometers. You aren't going to die. That's different thermometer. On that thermometer thirty-seven is normal. On this kind it's ninety-eight.\" \"Are you sure?\" \"Absolutely,\" I said, \"It's like miles and kilometers. You know, like how many kilometers we make when we do seventy miles in the car?\" \"Oh,\" he said. But his gaze at the foot of the bed relaxed slowly.

Many believe that arts subjects are  too easy, that practical skills are more useful and that a chosen subject for study should be clearly linked to a career.

The function of the modern university is to cater to different types of student. Arts subjects are not easy. For example, a degree in Literature is not an easy option. No question in a Literature class has a single, simple answer. Debate is conducted in a spirit of openness, texts are very closely analyzed and skills in close reading are developed. Literature is about language, our primary means of communication. Arts subjects require the same concentrated study as any other subject. Arts subjects can prepare students for any number of careers. A degree in an arts subject teaches skills in well organized debates and defence of a position through the provision of evidence. These are applicable to many types of career. Law, for example. The point is that an undergraduate degree in any Arts subject trains the student in analysis and structure. Therefore, Arts graduates can pursue any number of careers. Arts subjects allow the student to take time to choose a career.

The ancient Zhaozhou stone bridge started to be built in 590 during the Sui Dynasty (581~618) and established in 608.The pioneer for building the bridge was Li Chun who overcame unimaginable difficulties,undergoing all hardships.The location of the bridge is in Zhao County south,Hebei Province.It lay across the Xiaoshui River,far away from the mountains that provided rocky materials.In ancient times,it was such a busy,deep and wide river that could be used as an important carriage to transport heavy rocks and other materials.As we know,no train,no lifting machine could be used to move granite blocks to the construction site.As an intelligent stonemason and engineer,Li Chun worked out his plan and design all from his own direct observation and investigation.It took his whole life-time in completing the great historical project inChina.Nowadays it is not only a historical remarkable model of architecture,but also a brilliant Chinese cultural crystallization  of wisdom. The entire length of the bridge is 50.82 meters with 10 meters width.The whole stone bridge looks like a big bow,the span of which is 37.02 meters,and its height from the top to the surface of water at a regular position is 7.23 meters.The bridge arch seems to be moving smoothly and flatly.The whole arch consists of 28 big granite blocks connected each other tightly together.On both end sides of the general arch there are 4 smaller arches,2 of which on one side,the other 2 on the other side.The smaller arches could be used to decrease the weight of the bridge and save stone materials,and help flood get through easily,which seems to be much prettier.Such a hard-thinking and careful consideration of the engineering article is really a model of design and layout.The span was much wider than the other stone bridge in ancient times all over China. Today Zhaozhou Stone Bridge is one of international cultural relics and perfectly protected and preserved by the concerned administration of China.

Some people seem to think it's for practicing grammar rules and learning lists of words -- the longer the lists, the better. That's wrong. Language is for the exchange   of ideas and information. It's meaningless to know all about a language if you can't use it freely. Many students I have met know hundreds of grammar rules, but they can't speak correctly or fluently . They are afraid of making mistakes. One shouldn't be afraid of making mistakes when speaking a foreign language.  Native speakers often make mistakes and break rules, too.

Denise Chen and Wen Zhou have been experimenting with the science of smell, and have made some very interesting discoveries.                To explore that, you will need two things with strong, characteristic smells and, of course, your nose. The idea is to smell a different smell with each nostril  . Hold one smell very close to your right nostril, and the other smell very close to your left nostril. Then breathe in and pay close attention to what you smell.               What you should find is that one smell will be very strong. After another sniff   or two, the first smell will go away, and you will smell the other smell.

{"answer": 0, "choices": ["know only a little about China", "know much about China", "know nothing about China", "like China very much"], "question": "About 400 high school students from Western Pennsylvania and the neighboring state of Ohio joined a heated discussion recently on \"China: What Does the Future Hold?\"     \"It's either going to turn out really good or really bad - who knows?\" said Braveen Ragunathan, a senior from an Ohio high school. In his mind all Americans are connected to China in some way.     The forum   was held in Pittsburgh, once a US industrial center, now facing job-cuts because of competition brought about by globalization. The aim of the forum is to help American students learn more about the outside world.     Elliott Blackwell, a junior at the Neighborhood Academy, said the forum let him know more about how China's economic development will affect America in the future.     Some students, although impressed by China's economic boom, expressed uneasiness about the nation's practices and differences from the American way of doing business and politics.     \"China is a power coming up,so they might challenge us,\" Paul Amon, a junior from Oil City High School, said. \"I'd hope that China can be our partner but I think that we'd clash   along the way because we're too different,\" he added.     George Riley, a teacher explained: \"The view of China is usually negative   and I think that's fueled by the media.\"     However, some negative feelings are not from the media.

For example, when the board of the University of Colorado searched for a new president, it wanted a leader familiar with the state government, a major source of the university's budget. \"We didn't do any global consideration,\" says Patricia Hayes, the board's chair. The board finally picked Bruce Benson, a 69-year-old Colorado businessman and political activist  who is likely to do well in the main task of modern university presidents: fund-raising.

One of the oldest sports still practiced, boxing dates back to thousands of years ago. Today the sport is popular in many parts of the world and encompasses   both amateur and professional matches. For most of the 20th century boxing attracted huge fan and media attention in the United States. Some boxing champions became legendary, larger-than-life figures, such as Jack Dempsey, Joe Louis, and Muhammad Ali. Criticized to varying degrees throughout its history for its violent nature and high injury rate, boxing has somehow always managed to survive----and even thrive----as a sport. Modern boxing regulations are based upon the 12 rules set out by British boxing officials in the mid-19th century. These rules became known as the Marquess of Queensberry Rules, named after the 8th Marquess of Queensberry, John Sholto Douglas, who sponsored and published them. In addition to in-the-ring rules, modern boxing also has specific regulations regarding eligibility for the fighters themselves. The modern rules for professional and amateur boxing differ, but both types of contests are divided into time periods called rounds. In professional boxing, each round lasts three minutes; in amateur boxing, two minutes. A one-minute rest period between rounds is standard. Amateur contests consist of three rounds; professional contests may consist of up to 12 rounds. A bell is usually sounded by a timekeeper to begin and end each round. A key step in making boxing safer and more respectable was the introduction of gloves, ending brutal bare-knuckle competition. Boxing gloves are heavily padded to soften the impact of the blow and to protect the hands of the boxer. As an added protection, the hands are taped before being placed in the gloves, which are essentially huge mittens.

That's why it's important to pay attention to interview manners and to carefully think through how you will introduce yourself during a job interview. When arriving at the interview site you can introduce yourself to the receptionist   by giving your name and telling the purpose of your visit. For example: \"My name is Tim Jones and I have an interview scheduled with John Smith at 2 pm.\" You will be guided into the interview room or the hiring manager will come out to meet you in the reception area. Again, take the time to introduce yourself so the interviewer knows who you are. Offer to shake hands, even if the interviewer doesn't offer his hand first. Tell the interviewer that it is a pleasure to meet him. Smile, and be sure to make eye contact. Many hiring managers will start an interview with an open-ended question like \"Tell me about yourself.\" Your response should focus on the key elements in your background. You should carefully analyze the job first to the interviewer, and you can point out the interests, skills, experiences, and personal qualities.

For example, the Antarctic ice sheet is shrinking. A new study found that summer ice loss in parts of Antarctica was at its highest level in 1,000 years. The study showed that Antarctic ice was melting mostly from below ice shelves, where the water is warmer than the ice. Eric Rignot is an earth system expert at the University of California, Irvine. He also works for the American space agency, NASA. There he serves as senior research scientist at NASA's Jet Propulsion Laboratory, also in California. He says ice melting from below is responsible for 55 percent of the shelf loss from 2003 to 2008. That is a much higher rate than scientists thought earlier. Professor Rignot and his team used satellite observations, radar and computer models to measure features above the ice to learn what was going on below. The measurements show differences from one area to the next around the continent. The major ice shelves are called Ross, Filchner and Ronne. They make up two-thirds of Antarctica's ice shelves. But they are responsible for only 15 percent of the melting ice. The professor says even small changes, like changes in ocean flow driven by wind, can make a huge difference in the melting of the ice shelf. Sixty percent of the Earth's fresh water is held in the huge Antarctic ice sheet. Professor Rignot says the study will help experts predict how the continent reacts to warmer ocean waters and helps to cause rising sea levels around the world.

There were dust storms. Volcanoes erupted, sending ash and poisonous gases into the atmosphere. When people appeared on the scene and began their conquest of nature, they also began to pollute the air. They cleared land, which made possible even larger dust storms. They built cities, and the soot  from their hearths filled the air. The Roman author Seneca wrote in A.D. 61 of the \"stink, soot and heavy air \"of the imperial city. In 1257, the Queen of England was forced to move away from the city of Nottingham because the heavy smoke was unbearable. The industrial revolution brought even worse air pollution. Coal was burned to power factories and to heat homes. Soot, smoke, and sulfur dioxide  fill the air. The good old days? Not in the factory towns. But there were large rural areas unaffected by air pollution. With increasing population, the entire world is becoming more urban. It is the huge cities that are most affected by air pollution. But rural areas are not unaffected. In the neighborhoods around smoky factories, there is evidence of increased rates of spontaneous abortion  and of poor wool quality in sheep, decreased egg production and a high death rate in chickens. Traffic police in Tokyo have to wear gas masks and take \"oxygen breaks\" --breathing occasionally from tanks of oxygen. Smog in Athena at times has forced factory closings and traffic restrictions. Acid rain in Canada is caused by air pollution in the United States, contributing to strained relationships between the two countries. Sydney, Rome, Tehran, Ankara, Mexico City, and most other major cities in the world have had frightening experiences of air pollution. One of the two major types of smog--consisting of smoke, fog, sulfur dioxide, sulfuring acid (H2SO4), ash and soot--is called London smog. Indeed, the word smog is thought to have originated in England in 1905 as a contraction of the words \"smoke\" and \"fog.\" Probably the worst case of smog in history started in London on Thursday, 4 December, 1952. A large cold air mass moved into the valley of the Thames River. A temperature inversion placed a blanket of warm air over the cold air. With nightfall, a dense fog and below-freezing temperatures caused the people of London to put coal into their small stoves. Millions of these fires burned throughout the night, pouring sulfur dioxide and smoke into the air. The next day, Friday, the people continued to bum coal when the temperature remained below freezing. The factories added their smoke and chemical fumes to the atmosphere. Saturday was a day of darkness. For twenty miles around London, no light came through the smog. The air was cold and still. And the coal fires continued to bum throughout the weekend. On Monday, 8 December, more than one hundred people died of heart attacks while trying desperately to breathe. By the time a breeze cleared the air on Tuesday, 9 December, more than 4,000 deaths had been caused by the smog. Soot and ash can be removed by electrostatic precipitators . Unfortunately, they use large amounts of electricity, and the electrical energy, which is hardly affordable for most of us, has to come from somewhere. Fly ash removed from the air has to be put on the land or water, although it could be used in some way. The elimination  of sulfur dioxide is more difficult. Low-sulfur coal is rare and expensive. Although sulfur can be washed from finely pulverized  coal, the process is expensive. There are also processes for changing dirty coal into clean liquid and gaseous fuels. These processes may hold promise for the future, but they are too expensive to compete economically with other fuels at present. They also waste a part of the coal's energy.

A large cold air mass moved into the valley of the Thames River. A temperature inversion placed a blanket of warm air over the cold air. With nightfall, a dense fog and below-freezing temperatures caused the people of London to put coal into their small stoves. Millions of these fires burned throughout the night, pouring sulfur dioxide and smoke into the air. The next day, Friday, the people continued to bum coal when the temperature remained below freezing. The factories added their smoke and chemical fumes to the atmosphere. Saturday was a day of darkness. For twenty miles around London, no light came through the smog. The air was cold and still. And the coal fires continued to bum throughout the weekend. On Monday, 8 December, more than one hundred people died of heart attacks while trying desperately to breathe. By the time a breeze cleared the air on Tuesday, 9 December, more than 4,000 deaths had been caused by the smog. Soot and ash can be removed by electrostatic precipitators . Unfortunately, they use large amounts of electricity, and the electrical energy, which is hardly affordable for most of us, has to come from somewhere. Fly ash removed from the air has to be put on the land or water, although it could be used in some way. The elimination  of sulfur dioxide is more difficult. Low-sulfur coal is rare and expensive. Although sulfur can be washed from finely pulverized  coal, the process is expensive. There are also processes for changing dirty coal into clean liquid and gaseous fuels. These processes may hold promise for the future, but they are too expensive to compete economically with other fuels at present. They also waste a part of the coal's energy.

On October 25, a tsunami   caused by a 7.7 magnitude   earthquake in the Mentawai islands of West Sumatra, Indonesia hit shores and damaged whole villages. By last Friday, it had left about 450 dead and forced around 15,000 people to leave their homes. Tsunami is Japanese for \"harbor wave\". It is usually caused by a sudden rise or fall of part of the Earth's crust   under the ocean. It is most common in the Pacific and Indian oceans. Normally a tsunami is a series of waves. The waves can be very long - as much as 100 kilometers - and be as far as one hour apart. They are able to cross oceans without losing much energy. When the ocean is deep, tsunamis can travel unnoticed at speeds of up to 800 kilometers an hour. They can cross a whole ocean in a day or less. The wave may only be a few meters high but when they are near the shore and reach shallow water, they build up height very quickly. Some witnesses in the Mentawai islands reported seeing up to 6-meter high waves crash   onto the shore.

The study,published on the Nature website,uses the findings from plant life cycle studies and experiments across four continents and 1,634 species.It found that some experiments had underestimated  the speed of flowering by 8.5 times and leafing by 4 times. \"Across all species,the experiments under-predicted the speed of the advance--for both leafing and flowering -- that results from temperature increases,\"the study said. The design of future experiments may need to be improved to better predict how plants will react to climate change,it said. Plants are necessary for life on the Earth.They are the base of the food chain,using photosynthesis  to produce sugar from carbon dioxide and water.They let out oxygen which is needed by nearly every organism on the planet. Scientists believe the world's average temperature has risen by about 0.8 degC since 1900,and nearly 0.2 degC every ten years since 1979. So far,efforts to cut emissions   of planet-warming greenhouse gases are not seen as enough to prevent the Earth heating up beyond 2 degC this century-- a point scientists say will bring the danger of a changeable climate in which weather extremes are common,leading to drought,floods,crop failures and rising sea levels.

During the study, volunteers were asked to perform one of two simple tasks during which researchers checked to ask if the participants' minds were wandering.

Daniel, a psychologist in the United States, said that those with higher working memory ability reported \"more mind wandering during these simple tasks\", but their performance did not suffer. The results, published online in the journal Psychological Science, appear to confirm previous research that found working memory allows humans to deal with multiple   thoughts at the same time. Dr Smallwood,in Leipzig,Germany,said: \"What this study seems to suggest is that, when circumstances for the task aren't very difficult, people who have additional working memory resources arrange _ to think about things other than what they're doing. \" Working memory ability is also associated with general measures of intelligence, such as reading comprehension and IQ scores, and also offers a window into the widespread, but not well understood, field of internally   driven thoughts.

In the study, researchers looked at about 1,900 schoolchildren. The scientists found that the kids who had been instructed to spend more time outdoors over three years were 23 percent less likely to develop nearsightedness during this time than those who had not been instructed to spend more time outdoors. Moreover, among the kids who did become nearsighted during the study, the degree to which their eyesight worsened was slightly smaller among those who spent more time outdoors. The researchers selected six schools and required the children, whose average age was 7 at the start of the study, to attend one additional 60-minute class of outdoor activities during each school day for three years. The parents of these children were also encouraged to engage their children in outdoor activities after school, especially during weekends and holidays. The other half of the children, from another six schools, continued their usual activity patterns. Afterthree years, 30.4 percent of the kids in the intervention  group had become nearsighted, compared with 38.5 percent of the kids in the other group. It is not clear exactly why spending more time outside would benefit children's eyesight, the researchers said. However, some research has suggested that the higher levels of light intensity found outdoors may increase the release of the chemical dopamine  of the eye. In turn, dopamine is known to restrain the type of growth in the eye that is associated with nearsightedness.

Researchers used information from the Framingham Study, which began in 1948. The Framingham Study gathers information about physical and mental health, personal behavior and diet. At first, the study involved about 5,000 people in the American state of Massachusetts. Now, more than 12,000 individuals are taking part. Information from the Framingham Study showed earlier that happiness can spread from person to person. So can behaviors like littering and the ability to stop smoking. University of Chicago psychologist John Cacioppo led the recent study. He and other researchers attempted to show how often people felt lonely. They found that the feeling of loneliness spread through social groups. Having a social connection with a lonely person increased the chances that another individual would feel lonely. In fact, a friend of a lonely person was 52% more likely to develop feelings of loneliness. A friend of that person was 25% more likely. The researchers say this shows that a person could indirectly be affected by someone's loneliness. The effect was strongest among friends. Neighbors were the second most affected group. The effect was weaker on husbands and wives, and brothers and sisters. The researchers also found that loneliness spread more easily among women than men. The New York Times newspaper reports that, on average, people experience feelings of loneliness about 48 days a year. It also found that every additional friend can decrease loneliness by about five percent, or two and a half fewer lonely days. Loneliness has been linked to health problems like depression and sleeping difficulties. The researchers believe that knowing the causes of loneliness could help in reducing it.

Researchers used information from the Framingham Study, which began in 1948. The Framingham Study gathers information about physical and mental health, personal behavior and diet. At first, the study involved about 5,000 people in the American state of Massachusetts. Now, more than 12,000 individuals are taking part. Information from the Framingham Study showed earlier that happiness can spread from person to person. So can behaviors like littering and the ability to stop smoking. University of Chicago psychologist John Cacioppo led the recent study. He and other researchers attempted to show how often people felt lonely. They found that the feeling of loneliness spread through social groups. Having a social connection with a lonely person increased the chances that another individual would feel lonely. In fact, a friend of a lonely person was 52% more likely to develop feelings of loneliness. A friend of that person was 25% more likely. The researchers say this shows that a person could indirectly be affected by someone's loneliness. The effect was strongest among friends. Neighbors were the second most affected group. The effect was weaker on husbands and wives, and brothers and sisters. The researchers also found that loneliness spread more easily among women than men. The New York Times newspaper reports that, on average, people experience feelings of loneliness about 48 days a year. It also found that every additional friend can decrease loneliness by about five percent, or two and a half fewer lonely days. Loneliness has been linked to health problems like depression and sleeping difficulties. The researchers believe that knowing the causes of loneliness could help in reducing it.

Their arrival celebrated the bicentenary  of Charles Dickens's birth. This Grip was the third of the Tower ravens to be named after the novelist's own pet birD. One of his predecessors  was resident during World War Two; he and his mate Mabel were the only ravens to survive a bombing attack on the Tower. Dickens's Grip, who had an impressive vocabulary, appears as a character in the author's fifth novel, Barnaby Rudge. On 28 January 1841, Dickens wrote to his friend George Cattermole: \"my notion is to have [Barnaby] always in company with a pet raven, who is immeasurably more knowing than himself. To this end I have been studying my bird, and think I could make a very distinctive character of him.\" Unfortunately, just a few weeks after Dickens wrote that letter, Grip died, probably as a result of having stolen and eaten paint some months earlier. The bird had developed a strange habit - tearing sections off painted surfaces (including the family's carriage) and even drinking a quantity of white paint out of a tin. Dickens mourned his loss and wrote a humorous letter to his friend, the illustrator Daniel Maclise, about the raven's death. He related how, when Grip began to show signs of sickness, the vet was called and \"administered a powerful dose of castor  oil\". Initially this seemed to have a positive effect and the author was thrilled to see Grip restored to his usual personality when he bit the coachman (who was used to the raven and took it in good humor). The following morning, Grip was able to eat \"some warm porridge\", but his recovery was short liveD.

Newspapers today supply us with more than just what happened in our country or in other countries. If we want to know what the weather will be like, we can read the weather reports. If we want to find out what films are being shown, or what plays or concerts we can go to we can look in the newspapers. In many countries people put notices in newspapers if they are trying to get a job, hunting for a house or rooms that they can rent, or even when looking for a person who is lost.

After all, there is no natural reason why 2,500 people should accidentally shoot themselves each year or why 7,000 should drown or 55,000 die in their cars. No one establishes a quota   for each type of death. It just happens that they follow a consistent pattern year after year. A few years ago a Canadian psychologist named Gerald Wilde became interested in this phenomenon. He noticed that mortality rates for violent and accidental deaths throughout the Western world have remained strangely static throughout the whole of the century, despite all the technological advances and increases in safety standards that have happened in that time. Wilde developed an interesting theory called \"risk homeostasis\". According to this theory, people naturally live with a certain level of risk. When something is made safer, people will get around the measure in some way to get back to the original level of danger. If, for instance, they are required to wear seat belts, they will feel safer and thus will drive a little faster and a little more recklessly, thereby statistically canceling out the benefits that the seat belt offers. Other studies have shown that where a crossing is made safer, the accident rate invariably falls there but rises elsewhere along the same stretch of road as if making up for the drop. It appears, then, that we have an inborn need for danger.

Editions Philippe Picquier was also interested inFanHua, but didn't follow up owing to translation issues. The book is Jin's debut novel, which is set in Shanghai and tells stories of two decades: the 1960s and the 1990s.

So, putting a brave face on your sadness could be harmful. The research also found that women suffered more than men when pretending to be happy.

He said, \"Smiling for the sake of smiling can lead to emotional tiredness, and that's bad for the organization.\" He also said the research showed customer-service workers who had \"fake smiles\" throughout the day fell into a bad mood and didn't want to work, so their productivity dropped. The study is one of the first of its kind to examine emotional expressions over a period of time and compare the different effects on men and women.

Frame also explained if a vet school didn't work out, he would be interested in working in animal education. \"I would at least have a Zoology degree,\" Frame said, \"The wilds is connected to many zoos all over the country, so I'm sure I can find a job in education.\" For now, Frame plans to continue working at the wilds this coming summer with a new job at hand, which involves teaching the public about the endangered animals they are protecting and doing shows with owls. While Frame is still an undergraduate student at Miami, he continues his passion for animals. Becoming an exotic vet may be a few years down the road, but Frame continues to work had for this dream, hoping it will become a great reality.

Water from deep below the ground at Japan's tens of thousands of hot springs could be used to produce electricity. Although Japanese high-tech companies are leaders in geothermal  technology and export it, its use is limited in the nation. \"Japan should no doubt make use of its resources of geothermal energy,\" said Yoshiyasu Takefuji, a leading researcher of thermal-electric power production. The disastrous earthquake and tsunami on March 11, 2011 caused a reaction against atomic power, which previously made up 30 percent of Japan's energy needs, and increased interest in alternative energies, which account for only 8 percent. Artist Yoko Ono has called on Japan to explore its natural energy, following the example of Iceland which uses renewable energy for more than 80 percent of its needs. For now, geothermal energy makes up less than 1 percent of the energy needs in Japan, which has for decades relied heavily on fossil fuels and atomic power. The biggest problem to geothermal energy is the high initial cost of the exploration and constructing the factories.Another problem is that Japan's potentially best sites are already being developed for tourism or are located within national parks where construction is forbidden. \"We can't even dig 10cm inside national parks.\" said Shigeto Yamada of Fuji Electric, adding that regulations protecting nature would need to be relaxed for geothermal energy to grow. Researcher Hideaki Matsui said, \"Producing electricity using hot springs is a decades-long project.We also have to think about what to do for now as energy supplies will decline in the short term.\" The Earth Policy Institute in Washington, US, believed Japan could produce 80,000 megawatts and meet more than half its electricity needs with geothermal technology.

When you've got it, you never think about it. When you haven't got it, you think about it all the time. Our biggest enemies are not terrible diseases and so on. We are our own biggest enemies because we sometimes destroy our own good health. Some of us eat too much, drink too much and smoke too much. And though our reason tells us we should control ourselves, we find it difficult. The fact is that most human beings need stimulation  . Who doesn't enjoy a drink after a busy day? Only a smoker knows the pleasure of a cigarette with a cup of coffee. The danger is when these innocent pleasures run our lives and so destroy our health. When you find yourself eating between meals or eating too much rich food, when you can only keep yourself going by taking frequent   drinks or by smoking one cigarette after another, then it's time to stop and think what you might be doing to yourself. The funny thing is that when we don't control ourselves, simple pleasures are no longer simple pleasures. All right, I know what you're thinking. You're probably saying, \"It's easy to say, but I can't help myself. I need that extra bit of food, that extra drink, that extra cigarette. Life has so many pleasures that I can't do without them.\" But I'm saying you can help yourself. Not only that, you must help yourself. Because if you don't help yourself, no one else can.

{"answer": 1, "choices": ["admire the goddess Athena", "pray to their god", "search for sculptures", "learn about its complex history"], "question": "The Parthenon  in Athens is a building with a long and complex  history. Built nearly 2,500 years ago as a temple celebrating the Greek goddess Athena, it was for thousands of years the church of the Virgin Mary of the Athenians, then a mosque  , and finally a ruin. The building was changed and the sculptures  much damaged over the centuries. By 1800 only about half of the original sculptural decoration remained. Between 1801 and 1805, Lord Elgin, the British ambassador to the Ottoman Empire , which controlled Athens, acting with the full knowledge and permission of the Ottoman authorities,removed about half of the remaining sculptures from the fallen ruins and from the building itself. Lord Elgin loved Greek history and transported the sculptures back to Britain. The arrival of the sculptures in London had a huge effect on the European public, greatly increasing interest in ancient Greek culture and influencing contemporary artistic trends. These sculptures were gained from Lord Elgin by the British Museum in 1816 and since then they have all been on show to the public, free of charge. Since the early 1980s, however, the Greek government has argued for the return of all the Parthenon sculptures in the British Museum. They have also challenged the British Museum Board of Trustees' legal title to the sculptures. The British Museum, however, insists that it exists to tell the story of cultural achievement throughout the world, from the dawn of human history over two million years ago until the present day. The museum considers itself an important resource for the world: the breadth and depth of its collection allows the world public to re-examine cultural identities and explore the complex network of interconnected world cultures. It also says that, within the context of this unparalleled collection, the Parthenon sculptures are an important representation of ancient Athenian civilization.

Although you might be embarrassed to admit how many times you do this, don't worry. Psychological findings have shown it's completely normal. In fact, the pleasure we derive from   getting a \"like\" is equal to that of eating chocolate or winning money, and we can't help wanting more. According to the findings of the UCLA Brain Mapping Center, which observed 32 teens aged between 13 and 18, the feedback circuit   in the teens' brains are particularly sensitive, and the \"social\" and \"visual\" parts of their brains were activated when they received \"likes\" on a social network. The research also showed that though the thumbs up might come from complete strangers, the good they derive from it worked equally. So does it mean we should try our best to win as many thumbs up as possible? Not necessarily so if we know the reasons behind our desire for attention. In \"Why do people crave   attention\" by M. Farouk Radwan, he explained several cases in which people naturally longed for attention. Radwan said people who were an only child, who were used to being the center of attention in their house, may try to reproduce these conditions. Feeling \"overlooked and unappreciated\" might also lead you to be eager for attention. Other times, the state of being jealous or wanting to cover your mistakes may also contribute to such longings. In fact, too much desire for attention can create anxiety, and in turn ruin your happiness even when you get it. So what can we do about it?

The official Xinhua News Agency said the two deaths were reported in Shanghai and that three new cases were also confirmed in the financial hub. A total of 11 new cases were reported Sunday - including two in a central province that previously had been unaffected. In all, 60 cases of the virus, known as H7N9, have been reported in China. The two cases reported Sunday in central Henan province, which is next to Beijing, followed an announcement Saturday that a 7-year-old girl had become the first person in the capital to be infected with the virus. All previous reported cases were in Shanghai and other eastern areas of China. A World Health Organization official said Sunday that it wasn't surprising that the virus had spread to Beijing. Michael O'Leary, head of WHO's office in China, said it's not the case that everyone confirmed to be infected with H7N9 was \"clustered in one small area with the same source of exposure.\" \"So we've been expecting new cases to occur. ... Furthermore, we still expect that there will be other cases,\" he said. Four new cases were reported Sunday in eastern Zhejiang province and two more in Jiangsu. Health officials believe the virus, which was first spotted in humans last month, is spreading through direct contact with infected fowl. O'Leary said \"the good news\" was that there was still no evidence that humans had passed on the virus to other humans. \"As far as we know, all the cases are individually infected in a sporadic and not connected way,\" he said, adding that the source of infection was still being investigated. The girl from Beijing, whose parents are in the live poultry trade, was admitted to a hospital Thursday with symptoms of fever, sore throat, coughing and headache, the Beijing Health Bureau said. O'Leary said early treatment can be effective, as demonstrated by the girl, who was in stable condition. In the only other reported cases outside of eastern China, health officials in Henan province said tests on two men Thursday had later revealed they had the virus. They said a 34-year-old restaurant chef who had displayed flu symptoms for about a week was in critical condition in a hospital, while a 65-year-old farmer who was in frequent contact with poultry was in stable condition after receiving treatment. They said 19 people who had been in close contact with the two men did not show any flu symptoms.

It leads men to eat more _ meals, such as salads, fruit and vegetables, while women choose to make creamier, heavier dishes like curry or rich pasta sauces, which may please their partner. Women still have the strongest long-term influence over the couple's diet and lifestyle, as they still have the traditional role of shopper and cook in most households.

But the opposite is true for men, whose long-term health benefits when they move in with a female partner. Dieticians at Newcastle University said both partners try to please one another, and so change their dietary habits to suit their other half. It leads men to eat more _ meals, such as salads, fruit and vegetables, while women choose to make creamier, heavier dishes like curry or rich pasta sauces, which may please their partner. Women still have the strongest long-term influence over the couple's diet and lifestyle, as they still have the traditional role of shopper and cook in most households. The report, by Newcastle University's Human Nutrition Research Centre, reviewed the finding of a variety of research projects from the UK, North America and Australia, which looked at the eating and lifestyle habits of couples. The research shows that women are more likely to put on weight and increase their consumption of foods high in fat and sugar when they move in with their partner. Women also use food as a comfort when dealing with emotional stress and have been found to gain weight when a relationship ends, while the same finding has not been observed in men. Many couples reported food as being central to their partnership, and eating together in the evening was particularly important to many.

Choosing the right one is a difficult task. \"Finding a job\" is not the same as \"choosing a job\". Many young people end up in a job that they are not suited to do. \"Chance\" may play a more important part than \"decision\". So here are a few steps to help you think about jobs. First, it is important to recognize what kind of person you are and what special qualities make you different from everyone else. The most important thing is to know your interests and skills. But the point is that there is a difference between an interest and a skill. If you like art and enjoy looking at pictures, it is an interest. But if you can draw a horse that looks like a horse rather than a big dog, that is a skill. The best job is one that uses your skills in doing something together with your interests. As well as this,  it is an advantage if you believe that a particular job is worth doing in the world.

The reasoning is that, while you are young and unencumbered , you have the time and energy to fully devote yourself to a career.

Whenever we turn on the news to find out what's happening in East Asia, or Africa, or South America, or anywhere, local people are being interviewed and telling us about it in English. Indeed, if one looks at the facts about the amazing reach of the English language, he or she would be surprised. English is used in over 90 countries as an official or semi-official language. English is the working language of many international colleges as well as of most international research scientists. It is believed that over one billion people worldwide are learning English now. One of the most remarkable sides of the spread of English around the world has been the extent   to which Europeans are accepting it as their language. English is spreading from northern Europe to the south and is now firmly set up as a second language in countries such as Sweden, Norway, Netherlands and Denmark. If one visits any of them , it would seem that almost everyone there can communicate with ease in English. Recently, a special survey of Europeans' use of languages has just been published. The report said that English is the most widely known foreign language now, with 43% of Europeans saying they speak it and that Sweden now holds the most of English speakers, with over 89% of the population. What's more, English is the language _ as the most useful language to know, with over 77% of Europeans who do not speak English as their first language considering it useful.

Amy Chua is a law professor at America's Yale University and her recent book on the subject is making waves. She's been called \"dangerous\",\"outrageous\",even a \"monster\" for her descriptions of how she brought up her two daughters. Her bookBattle Hymn of the Tiger Motherdescribes fighting with a daughter for hours at the piano to ensure the child gets a piece of music right. She rejected birthday cards made for her by her girls because she didn't think they had made enough effort. She compared one child negatively with the other, threatening to burn their toys. Her rules include: schoolwork always comes first; an A-minus is a bad grade; children must be two years ahead of their classmates in math, and playing the violin or the piano is a must. Ms. Chua considers the Chinese hard work ethic as a way of creating happy, successful children--at least in her case. Although she's had a large amount of _ for her theories, one thing can't be ignored--the success of Chinese children in the education system. In Britain, shocking research shows that Chinese girls, for example, are outperforming all other foreign groups at GCSE--79 percent getting 5 A--C Grades, compared with 58 percent of white British girls. So what is it about Chinese parenting that's leading to high achievers? And how do Amy Chua's theories play into that success? She told me that if her daughter came back from school with 96/100 in a test, Chua would ask her what happened to the other 4 points. It's about always knowing \"you can do better\",she told me. Interestingly, in China, the birthplace of the tiger mother, people are moving away from traditional Chinese parenting. They are following more western parenting styles.

{"answer": 2, "choices": ["Nobody.", "Everybody.", "2 in 100.", "98 in 100."], "question": "Many people think it is safe to use a cell phone while they are driving. Yet Scores of studies suggest that real multitaskers - those who can carry out multiple   tasks equally well, make up just 2 per cent of the population. More surprisingly, the so-called \"supertaskers\" actually have differently structured brains to the other 98 percent.  The brain areas that make supertaskers differ from the rest of the population are the same parts that are most different between humans and nonhuman primates  , according to David Strayer, director of the applied cognition lab at the University of Utah. Scientists are unsure of the reason why some brains are different. In fact, we could all benefit from doing just one task at once. In most of us, scientists have located a \"bottleneck in the brain\" that may explain why we find it hard to do two things at once. The problem appears to be caused by a logjam of nerve messages. Faced with two almost simultaneous   tasks less than 300 milliseconds apart, the brain's ability to deal with the second one slows down. The neural   response to the second task was postponed until the response to the first was completed. This means that with e-mails, phone calls, text messages and online social media all competing for our attention, often against a background of television, radio or music, our brains can reach information overload.  Scientists made the discovery after scanning the brains of volunteers attempting to multitask on a computer. The task was deliberately designed to involve the use of different senses and  _ responses. Dr Rene Marois, one of the neuroscientists who carried out the experiment at Vanderbilt University in Nashville, Tennessee, said: \"Our research offers neurological evidence that the brain cannot effectively do two things at once.\" The next step, the neuroscientists say, is finding out \"why these areas cannot process two tasks at once.\" How many people can drive equally well while using a cell phone?", "subject": ""}

It was founded in 1941 in Wales and attracts hundreds of thousands of adventurous types every year . The courses are to broaden minds through experiences that build confidence , self-esteem (  ) and character . As well as specialist courses such as canoeing , leadership skills and sailing , participants can take part in week long adventure training camps which include a host of sports and survival training education skills . Michael Williams , an American student , took part in an Outward Bound course last year . He said : \"We learned lots of first aid skills , lots of natural history , lots of environmental facts , and participated in a wildlife preservation ( protecting ) programme . Beyond that , my favorite skills learned were sailing and rock climbing .\" Courses can last up to 40 days and are open to anyone over the age of 14 . Students must be in general good health , but do not need to be experienced in outdoor-sports . There is no selection process ; everyone is welcome , although new participants are advised to pick a course matching their physical power . Most of the British courses take place in the Beacons in Wales . Another similar organization is the UK Survival School , which includes courses on learning to live with the environment , sailing and winter survival . On a basic survival weekend students will learn how to get water and food , how to make fire and cook with it , to find and build a shelter , control survival life support , how to cross rivers , send off an SOS signal , and to use compasses by day and night . According to the leaders , such adventures are \"an awakening , an exploration into unknown.\" Outward Bound believes that participants will \"use mind and body traveling some of the earth's roughest wildness areas .\" What's the writer's purpose to write this passage ?", "subject": ""}
{"answer": 2, "choices": ["Doubtful.", "Angry.", "Happy.", "Regretful."], "question": "Kitty is a little black-and-brown Australian dog. It's not a particularly bright dog. While Dad can make my sister and me afraid just by the tone of his voice, I have never heard him raise his voice at Kitty. In fact, one look from Kitty at the biscuit tin is enough to send my dad flying to get him a snack. Whenever we protest  about the unfair treatment, Dad has a sorry smile on his face. It's become a long-standing family joke that Kitty is the closest thing to a son Dad will ever have. Then, five years ago, our lives were turned upside down when Dad suffered two major strokes within a month. For four long months, mentally he was non-responsive. We had to take turns standing by his bedside to protect him. We were exhausted after every \"shift\" but grateful that he was still alive. As the months went by, I couldn't help but talk about Kitty constantly, often hoping that Dad could show some awareness of what I said. Then one day, without even realizing it, I blurted out , \"Is Kitty a tiger?\" Dad began to smile. It was the first sign in four months that Dad had showed any awareness of what I said. Seeing this, the whole family felt a huge weight lift from our shoulders. Over the next nine months, Dad had to learn all the basic things we take for granted. Dad, who was an independent man with a successful career before all this happened, found it increasingly frustrating . The only thing that ever brought a smile to his face was talk of Kitty. When we massaged Dad's arms and legs to prevent his muscles from weakening, I would always say: \"Now all you need is Kitty to give you a 'lick-lick' foot massage!\" No matter how many times I repeated this comment, the whole family would laugh.

Just as the eye sees light waves in the form of color1s, the ear hears sound waves in the form of noises. The ear and the eye turn these different waves into signals that the brain can make sense of. The ears and brain have an amazing ability to recognize particular sounds. For example, a mother often can tell when her baby is crying even if there are other crying babies in the same room. This is because the sound of her baby's cry has special meaning to her and the brain has recorded its importance. The ability to recognize sounds improves with experiences. As the brain receives information about sounds from day to day, it stores the information in its memory. When the brain hears new sounds, it gives meaning to them based on the information already in the memory. This is why certain words or songs can make a person happy. Often it is not the words or songs themselves that cause this feeling. The sounds are connected to happy memories for that person. Another hearing process controlled by the brain is to decide where a sound is coming from. One ear is usually closer to the source of a sound than the other ear is. Sound waves are stronger when they reach the ear that is closer. They also reach the closer ear first.

Their values--this can't be repeated too often--are not necessarily our values. Physical comfort, cleanness and order are not necessarily the most important things. The social services from time to time find themselves faced with a flat with decaying food covered by small worms  , and an old person lying alone in bed, taking no notice of the worms. But is it interfering   with personal freedom to insist that they go to live with some of their relatives so that they might be taken better care of? Some social workers, the ones who clear up the worms, think we are in danger of carrying this concept of personal freedom to the point where serious risks are being taken with the health and safety of the old. Indeed, the old can be easily hurt or harmed. The body is like a car, it needs more mechanical maintenance as it gets older. You can carry this comparison right through to the provision of spare parts. But never forget that such operations are painful experiences, however good the results. And at what point should you stop treating the old body? Is it morally right to try to push off death by pursuing the development of drugs to excite the forgetful old mind and to activate the old body, knowing that it is designed to die? You cannot ask doctors or scientists to decide, because so long as they can see the technical opportunities, they will feel bound to give them a try, on the principle that while there's life, there's hope.

Learn all you can about your first day before the first day. Take part in some activities that are held at the school for new students to know the school better. If parents are invited to these activities, take yours with you. Carefully look over all the materials you receive. Be sure you know where the school's buildings are. Get the things you will need for class. Buy the things suggested on your teachers' supply lists and place your materials for each class separately. Keep up with your high school workload . If you find you're not doing well in a subject, make use of after-school study groups or ask your teacher to help you with your schoolwork. Consider private tutoring to get you through a difficult time.

Researchers at the University of Liverpool found the works of Shakespeare and Wordsworth and the like had a beneficial effect on the mind, lifting the readers' spirits by catching their attention and leading to moments of self-reflection. Using equipment, they examined the brain activity of volunteers as they read pieces of classical English literature both in their original form and in a more simplified, modern translation. And, according to the Sunday Telegraph, the experiment showed the more \"challenging\" works set off far more electrical activity in the brain than the ordinary versions. The research also found poetry, in particular, increased activity in the right hemisphere   of the brain, an area concerned with \"autobiographical memory\", which helped the reader to reflect on and reevaluate their own experiences in light of what they had read. The academics said this meant the classics were more useful than self-help books. The brain responses of 30 volunteers was monitored in the first part of the research as they read Shakespeare in its original and \"modern\" form. In one example, volunteers read a line from King Lear, \"A father and a gracious  aged man: him have you madded \", before reading the simpler \"A father and a gracious aged man: him you have enraged \".

{"answer": 0, "choices": ["Students.", "Parents.", "Teachers.", "Doctors."], "question": "As you grow older, you'll be faced with some challenging decisions--like whether to cut class or try cigarettes. Making decisions on your own is hard enough, but when other people get involved and try to pressure you one way or another it can be even harder.

Peers can have a positive influence on each other. Maybe another student in your science class taught you an easy way to remember the planets in the solar system. Maybe you got others excited about your new favorite book, and now everyone's reading it. These are examples of how peers positively influence each other. Sometimes peers influence each other in negative ways. For example, a few kids in school might try to get you to cut class with them; your soccer friend might try to convince you to be mean to another player and never pass him the ball. It is tough to be the only one who says \"no\" to peer pressure, but you can do it. Paying attention to your own feelings and beliefs about what is right and wrong can help you know the right thing to do. You've probably had a parent or teacher advising you to \"choose your friends wisely.\" Peer pressure is a big reason why they say this. If you choose friends who don't cut class, smoke cigarettes, or lie to their parents, then you probably won't do these things either, even if other kids do.

The annual migration is also closely tied to the lunar schedule. The crabs arrive at the coast and breed at such a time that the females can produce eggs and develop them in caves for a dozen or so days before carrying them into the sea exactly when high tide turns between the last quarter and new moon. During this period sea level on the beaches varies the least and offers an easier approach, which is so important that if the weather delays the migration crabs will put off laying eggs until the next lunar month.

If you pause during your journey through tile forest, you are likely to see rabbits, grey squirrels, and red foxes. Along the banks of tile river, birdwatchers will spot Canada geese and wood ducks all year round Fishing The Patapsco River meanders through the park and is a popular attraction for anglers  . The Department of Natural Resources' Fisheries Service assigns the river as a put-and-take fishery  with adult rainbow and brown trout in spring and fall. Anglers also enjoy catching naturally reproducing smallmouth and largemouth bass, bluegill, redbreast sunfish and yellow perch. Fishing opportunities have been specially set aside at Lost Lake for youth under 16 and seniors 62 years of age and older. This area is also designed for anglers with disabilities. Trails Adventure seekers will enjoy hiking, mountain biking and horseback riding on the park's popular trail system. More than 17 miles of challenging and rough single track trails follow the ridges, steep hillsides and stream valleys in the park. These trails are also excellent gateways for wildlife viewing, bird watching and general nature appreciation. Please respect the rights of nearby private property owners by using only blazed   trails.

New research from Vanderbilt University reveals that children learn the solution to a problem best when they explain it to their mom. \"We knew that children learn well with their moms or with a peer, but we did not know if that was because they were getting feedback and help,\" Bethany Rittle-Johnson, the study's lead author and assistant professor of psychology at Vanderbilt's Peabody College of education and human development, said. \"In this study, we just had the children's mothers listen, without providing any assistance.

{"answer": 2, "choices": ["they are floating above their own bodies", "they are walking towards a light", "they are flying in the sky", "they are seeing a bright light"], "question": "An out-of-body experience? It's just your brain playing tricks on you. Some report feeling as if they are floating above their own bodies, while others find themselves drawn towards a blinding light. But out-of-body experiences are nothing more than a trick of the mind, scientists claim. They say that common spooky scenarios, such as floating above a hospital bed or walking towards the light at the end of a tunnel, can be explained by the brain trying to make sense of the process of death. Scientists from the universities of Edinburgh and Cambridge reviewed studies into changes in the brain that cause certain strong feelings associated with near-death experiences. Researcher Caroline Watt said one common vision -- that of people seeing a bright light which seems to be drawing them into the afterlife -- is probably produced by the death of the cells we use to process the light picked up by our eyes and turn it into pictures. \"It is simply your brain trying to make sense of the unusual experiences you are having,\" Dr Watt said. Feelings of being out of the body can also be explained by the brain's behavior, the journal Trends in Cognitive Science reports. \"If you put on a virtual   reality headset   showing an image of yourself three feet in front, you can trick your brain into thinking that is you over there, and get the sense you are outside your body,\" Dr Watt added. The scientific evidence suggests that all aspects of the near-death experience have a biological basis. In another example, the hormone noradrenalin, which is released when we suffer from stress and injuries, could be behind the feelings of love and peace that many experience when they seem to be approaching death. However, other scientists say we should not be so quick to dismiss (stop considering) people's accounts (descriptions). Sam Parnia, of the University of Southampton, stressed that being able to trace something back to the brain does not mean it is not real. Dr Parnia, who is close to completing a three-year study of hospital patients' recollections of their near-death experiences, said, \"Every experience, whether near-death or otherwise -- such as depression, happiness and love -- is mediated   by the brain.\" According to the passage, when people are dying, some may have the following feelings except that   _  .", "subject": ""}

The idea is not to rid the world of the Canadian teenager -- he would come back down to Earth eventually, after all -- but rather to help jump-start the emerging suborbital spaceflight industry. It would generate a lot of public interest, which would help commercial spaceflight pick up some much-needed momentum, said Seth Shostak, senior astronomer at the Search for Extraterrestrial Intelligence (SETI) Institute in Mountain View, California. \"If there's more interest, there are more customers.

Charles said each ATM serves about l,000 cupcakes per day.The machine is so popular that when it appeared in Manhattan, customers were lined up around the block to use _  Yet,inventing the first cupcake ATM was not as easy as convincing customers to use it.When the Nelsons started defigning the machine,they quickly realized nothing existed that could give a fully unbroken cupcake to a customer.The company had to partner with a European firm to develop the technology that could deliver a cupcake without dropping it several feet like a typical machine.After going through a seeond development cycle with the product, the ATMs can now satisfy tlle demand of growing customers and even make as many as four cupcakes at a time. In terms of the company, the-machine allows Sprinkles to do the impossible:increase hours of operation without raising costs.Now the company can sell cupcakes around the clock through the ATM without paying employees. Now the company is partnering with a Middle Eastern company to open 34 new locations abroad. What can we infer from the text?", "subject": ""}

Every cell in our bodies carries genetic instructions in our DNA that act as a kind of operating handbook. However, each cell only \"reads\" the part of this handbook it needs at any given moment. Can sleep affect how a gene reads instructions? It's a question asked by Professor Derk-Jan Dijk at the University of Surrey. He set up an experiment and asked his volunteers to spend a week sleeping around seven and a half hours to eight hours a night and the next sleeping six and a half to seven hours. Blood samples were taken each week to compare which genes in blood cells were being used during the long and short nights. The results were rather surprising. Several hundred genes changed in the amount they were being used, including some that are linked to heart disease, cancer, and Type 2 diabetes. Genes to do with cell repair and replacement were used much less. Sleep restriction(six and a half to seven hours a night) changed 380 genes.

Sadly, today's children are being armed with more dangerous tools like weapons  , drugs and gangs. Once a relatively peaceful environment, many schoolyards of today are becoming unsafe for both students and teachers. Home schools are available to give you choices. Home schooling provides top-quality education, flexibility, and freedom to create your own schedule. At Heritage Home School we believe the choice should be yours. Thanks in part to modern technology, home schooling information is becoming readily available across our nation. A recent study by the ITBS (Iowa Tests of Basic Skills) and TAP (Tests of Achievement and Proficiency) shows us that students of home schools do particularly well when compared with the nationwide average. In every subject at every grade level, students of home schooling scored obviously higher than those in public and private schools. If you're new to home schooling, you may be asking yourself, \"Will home schools really work for my children?\" Fact: A nationwide study using a random selection of 1,516 families found students of home schooling to be scoring, on average, at or above the 80th percentile in all areas on standardized achievement test.

The tower is 300 m high and consists of an open iron framework making it the highest manmade structure in the world at the time.  It was almost not built.

To everyone's surprise, including Eiffel, the tower was paid off in the first year.  The deal that Eiffel came up with was probably what saved the tower from destruction.

{"answer": 3, "choices": ["boats and caravans can often be seen", "isolated farms don't have enough electricity", "there are less human activities", "the wind is strong and reliable"], "question": "We've used the wind as an energy source for a long time. The Babylonians and Chinese were using wind power to pump water for irrigating crops 4,000 years ago, and sailing boats were around long before that. Wind power was used in the Middle Ages, in Europe, to grind  corn, which is where the term \"windmill\" comes from.  We can use the energy in the wind by building a tall tower, with a large propeller on the top. The wind blows the propellor round, which turns a generator to produce electricity. We tend to build many of these towers together, to make a \"wind farm\" and produce more electricity. The more towers, the more wind, and the larger the propellors, the more electricity we can make. It's only worth building wind farms in places that have strong, steady winds, although boats and caravans increasingly have small wind generators to help keep their batteries charged. The best places for wind farms are in coastal areas, at the tops of rounded hills, open plains and gaps in mountains - places where the wind is strong and reliable. Some are offshore. To be worthwhile, you need an average wind speed of around 25 km/h. Most wind farms in the UK are in Cornwall or Wales. Isolated places such as farms may have their own wind generators. In California, several \"wind farms\" supply electricity to homes around Los Angeles. The propellors are large, to obtain energy from the largest possible volume of air.

{"answer": 3, "choices": ["the first year", "the second year", "the third year", "the fourth year"], "question": "But what is teacher quality? How can one measure it reliably? An analysis is issued on a sample of data from a Texas school district. Experts argue convincingly that teacher effectiveness should be measured by students' gains on standardized tests: Mr. Smith is probably a better teacher than Ms. Brown if his students consistently improve their test scores more than hers do. Though this approach is appealing, there are tricky issues. For example, what if Ms. Brown teaches in a school where students score so high there is little room for improvement? The authors try to correct for this problem, as well as other sorts of measurement issues, to generate a measurement of teacher effectiveness. The paper is primarily concerned with how this measure is related to other observable characteristics. The first finding is that there is a large variation in teacher effectiveness: some teachers consistently have a larger impact on their students' achievement than others. Second, easily observable characteristics like having a master's degree or a passing score on the teacher certification exam are not correlated with teacher effectiveness. Then what does matter? The most important single influence is experience: first-year teachers are much less effective than others. The second year is significantly better, and by the fourth year, _ . It is not entirely clear whether this experience effect is learning by doing (the more you teach, the more effective you become) or survival of the fittest (those who are not good at teaching tend to drop out early.) From my reading of the paper, both effects appear important and there is no simple answer. The data do suggest, however, that teacher effectiveness is pretty clear by the end of the second year, so the information to make an informed decision is available at that time. The authors also investigate the contentious issue of racial matching of students and teachers. Here they find strong evidence that minority teachers tend to be more effective with minority students. Again, it is unclear whether this is because of a role model effect (students respond better to a teacher of their own race) or an empathy effect (teachers empathize better with students of their own race) or something else entirely.
