{"answer": 2, "choices": ["paid counselors", "money lenders", "good listeners", "next-door neighbors"], "question": "Real-life Friends Most people know the saying: A man's best friend is his dog; and that Diamonds are a girl's best friend. However, dogs can't offer advice or make you a cup of tea when you need one; and precious stones are cold comfort when you need a hug, and a shoulder to cry on. What are Friends? There are many ways to describe a friend. Friends are the family you can choose for yourself. Friends are a much better medication than medication is, and people who spend time with friends are happier with their lives as they are less lonely. A good friend will put you to bed when you're lost consciousness. Ensure you're not laid on your back, and remember to remove your shoes. You should be able to tell a true friend anything without being judged by them. How do Friendships Begin? This is an easy question. Find someone else who has similar interests with you. You now have another person to talk to about your shared interest but remember they like to talk too, so be prepared to shut up and listen once in a while. Hopefully they will have other friends and will introduce you to them, thereby expanding your circle. Friendships which begin due to location, for example, next-door neighbors or school classmates, rarely survive transitions such as moving to other neighborhoods, schools, colleges, jobs, immigration, and so forth. Attend a school reunion and you'll wonder what on earth you ever had in common with these people other than your age, although it is possible to have a friendship with someone you met at school. Mutually maintain it, and eventually become godparent or \"uncle\" to each others' children. How Friendships are Maintained To have a friend you must also be a friend and be prepared to be there for them should they need you. Failure in this respect would label you and you would most probably be abandoned. Boundaries Like every other relationship you have in your life, there are boundaries you shouldn't cross with your friends. One of those is money: Don't lend to your friend and don't ask for a loan yourself. Friends are unpaid counselors ,but phoning them at 2 am because you're awake and would like a chat is not a good idea. Neither is phoning them at 10 am if you know they're a shift-worker. Friends are people who need some space and quiet time. Generally, it all boils down to mutual respect and understanding. It's not a good plan to interrupt your friend while they're on a date/on holiday/attending an orchestral recital/at a funeral. Trust Trust is the most vital element in any relationship. If you're not trustworthy then you probably don't deserve friends, so try to remember that you promised to see that dull film with them or applaud them at their first attempt at a karaoke or an Open Mic night. If you have promised to look after their clothes while they go for a bet, then make sure you do. You might like to carry enough cash to help them out too, as you never know when that situation might be reversed. Don't lie to your friend: if they know you well they'll know you're lying or will at least be suspicious. If you find out something that you know will hurt your friend, be tactful . Do they need to know? Would they appreciate knowing? Can you tell their mum so she can break the news? Cowardly, yes, but mums usually have a much better way with words. Remember, if you do decide to tell them and it's painful, they will probably need some time alone, after lashing out at the closest thing--you. In that case, play the waiting game.

Mo created a cast of colorful characters and said that if there was a prototype , it would be the abandoned \"black boy\" who first appeared in the 1985 novel Red Transparent Radish, which bears imprints of the author's childhood. Mo dropped out of school during the Cultural Revolution when he was 12 and began to work, first in agriculture, later in a factory. At 20, he joined the People's Liberation Army and during this time he began to study literature and write. His first short story was published in a literary journal in 1981. His breakthrough came a few years later with the novel Red Transparent Radish. Many got to know of Mo through director Zhang Yimou's film, Red Sorghum. It was adapted from his 1986 novel of the same name, bringing to life a visual landscape of red sorghum fields and a fiery setting sun. Mo left the army in 1997 and gradually developed a writing style all of his own.

{"answer": 2, "choices": ["relaxed", "angry", "excited", "disappointed"], "question": "Compared to Iron Man 1, which I really like, Iron Man 2 has more action, better special effects and is funnier. In Iron Man 2, Tony Stark (Robert Downey Jr.) faces two enemies--a weapon producer named Justin Hammer (Sam Rockwell) and Ivan Vanko (Mickey Rourke), a horrible-looking Russian who wants revenge   for something related to Tony's father. Besides the two enemies, Tony is also facing his own death. His man-made heart, which gives his Iron Man suit its power, is also harming his body. My favourite part of the movie was when Iron Man uses his laser   against an army of Hammer's Iron Man robots. Everyone in the theater was cheering. My favourite special effects scene was the fight scene at a car race. Ivan tore Tony's car apart piece by piece.

Among the three versions of images he drew, director, Fu Hongxing, chose to use the version which was moderately realistic. \"Deng's animated images are not static  in the film. When he's at meetings, the images are more serious, and when he's at a party, he's _ in a more lively way,\" said Zhu. For the young animator, animation can tell the story of that period of history better to younger viewers. \"At first glance, animation may seem simple, but in reality, we need to do a large amount of homework, like checking what dishes were served at a dinner or what paintings were displayed in a particular room.\" Zhu said he and the team went through a lot of historical documents and reviewed video clips   in the process of creation. Fu said the film is in honor of Deng's contribution to China as well as his influence on generations of Chinese people. Production was completed last year, which marked the l10th anniversary of Deng's birth and also the 35thanniversary of Sino-US diplomatic relations. Why was the documentary made ?", "subject": ""}

Researchers in London and at the University of Bristol launched their study to investigate whether family structure affects the likelihood of depression in men around the time their child is born. They looked at men from traditional families, men with children from a previous relationship, men whose partners had children by a former partner, and men who were not living with their partners. All 7,108 participants filled out a questionnaire on depression, and answered questions about their age, education level and employment status. Details about the quality of their relationships with their partners, networks of friends and previous life events were also recorded. About 3.5 percent of the men and 13 percent of their partners suffered depression around the time their child was born. While men in stepfamilies or who were not living with their partners were twice as likely to get depressed as those in traditional families, this could be explained by other factors that are more common in nontraditional families, such as poor education and relationship conflicts. Even allowing for all these factors, however, the partners of women who were suffering from prenatal   depression were significantly more likely to become depressed themselves, the researchers report in an American journal. Ten percent of women who were depressed had depressed partners. For the healthy women, the figure was only 2.6 percent.

Take a closer look at the baby playing at the table.Each time the bowl of rice is pushed over the table edge,it falls in the ground---and, in the process, it belongs out important evidence about how physical objects interact ; bowls of rice do not flood in mid-sit, but require support to remain stable. It is likely that babies are not born knowing the basic fact of the universe; nor are they ever clearly taught it. Instead, babies may form an understanding of object support through repeated experiments and then build on this knowledge to learn even more about how objects interact. Though their ranges and tools differ, the baby's investigation and the scientist's experiment appear to share the same aim(to learn about the natural world ), overall approach (gathering direct evidence from the world), and logic (are my observations what I expected?). Some psychologists suggest that young children learn about more than just the physical world in this way---that they investigate human psychology and the rules of language  using similar means. For example, it may only be through repeated experiments, evidence gathering, and finally overturning a theory, that a baby will come to accept the idea that other people can have different views and desires from what he or she has, for example, unlike the child , Mommy actually doesn't like Dove chocolate. Viewing childhood development as a scientific investigation throws on how children learn ,but it also offers an inspiring look at science and scientists. Why do young children and scientists seem to be so much alike? Psychologists have suggested that science as an effort ---the desire to explore, explain, and understand our world---is simply something that comes from our babyhood. Perhaps evolution provided human babies with curiosity and a natural drive to explain their worlds, and adult scientists simply make use of the same drive that served them as children.

Most of the time she generally ignored everyone in her presence. An elderly nurse believed there was hope, however, and she made it her mission to show love to the child. Every day she visited Little Annie. For the most part, the child did not acknowledge the nurse's presence, but she still continued to visit. The kind woman left cookies for her and spoke words of love and encouragement. She believed Little Annie could recover, if only she were shown love. Eventually, doctors noticed a change in the girl.

The fearless girl is only 10, but already has scaled great heights in the sport of rock climbing. Last week, Kane won a bronze in the 11andyounger sport class at the USA Climbing Youth National Championships in Atlanta. She was the only competitor of the 31 there with no climbing coach or topflight facilities in which to train. Climbing will become an exhibition at the 2016 Rio de Janeiro Olympics in Brazil. The hope of enthusiasts is that the sport will gain full status in 2020.\"I'm already training for that,\" said Kane. \"Climbing is my passion, my love, and I want to make something of it.\" Her dad took her to climb rocks on her fourth birthday for the first time and today he can't keep up with her, \"It's the freedom to let loose,\" she said. \"When I'm up there, I'm so focused and don't hear anything. I always feel comforted knowing people are supporting me.\" The bronze in Atlanta qualified Kane for the USA team and November's International Championships in Ecuador. That's a trip she might have to miss because it's too expensive. Kane held a backyard music concert---she played the guitar and the piano and wrote inspirational songs---and raised $600 for her $1,500 trip to Atlanta. She's also been sponsored by a shoe company, but must rely heavily on donations from family and friends for travel expenses. Her mom Heather Kane said the family has chosen \"to do whatever we need to help her achieve her goals\". One of Grace's biggest challenges is finding balance in her life.

And so in June of eighteen seventy-seven,the Nez Perce left their home in the Wallowa Valley. They left quickly. They were able to take only a small part of what they owned,and just a few cattle and Appaloosa horses. When the Indians reached the Snake River,the water was very deep and ran very fast with melted snow from the mountains. Chief Joseph and his people made boats from sticks and dried animal skins to cross the river. While the Indians were busy,a group of white men came and stole some of the cattle waiting at the edge of the river. The other chiefs demanded that Joseph call a meeting. Two of the chiefs,White Bird and Toohoolhoolzote,spoke for War,but Joseph held different opinion. Some of the young men in White Bird's group were very angry. That night,they rode into the countryside and killed eleven white persons. During all his years as chief,Joseph had tried to keep the peace. Now he saw there was no hope.

{"answer": 3, "choices": ["sleep four to five hours at most", "sleep as much as possible", "have a shallow sleep", "sleep with four or five periods of REM"], "question": "People who enjoy a dream-filled sleep are better at recalling information and making links between facts when they wake, scientists found. But recharging with a shallow nap   offers no such mental improvement, the research suggests. The results of the study add to the evidence that Rapid Eye Movement (REM) sleep is very important to the brain's ability to strengthen memories.  An average night's sleep includes four or five periods of REM sleep, but these tend to be longer towards the end of the night. This means that adults who get less than the recommended seven to eight hours a night -- and therefore inadequate REM sleep -- may be damaging their mind's ability to form strong memories. Although REM sleep is not classified as a type of deep sleep, it is only reached after the brain has passed through deep sleep stages.   In the most recent study, participants were shown groups of three words -- such as \"cookie\", \"heart\", and \"sixteen\" -- and asked to find another word that can be associated with all three words. In this example, the answer would have been \"sweet\". They were tested once in the morning and then given the same task again in the afternoon. In between, some were allowed a nap with REM sleep, some a nap without REM sleep, while the others had a quiet rest period. The quiet rest and non-REM sleep groups showed no improvement in their test results, but the REM sleep group improved on their morning performance by an average of almost 40 percent.    Dr Sara Mednick, a sleep researcher at the University of California who led the study, believes the formation of connections between previously unassociated information in the brain -- which leads to creative problem-solving -- is encouraged by mental changes which occur during REM sleep.

One' s physical assets and liabilities don' t count all that much in a managerial career. A woman should always try to look her best. Over the last 30 years, social scientists have conducted more than 1,000 studies of how we react to beautiful and not- so-beautiful people.

With the possible exception of women seeking managerial jobs they are also more likely to be hired, paid well, and promoted. Un-American, you say, unfair and extremely unbelievable? Once again, the scientists have caught us mouthing pieties   while acting just the contrary. Their typical experiment works something like this. They give each member of a group--college students, perhaps, or teachers or corporate personnel managers a piece of paper relating an individual' s accomplishments. Attached to the paper is a photograph. While the papers all say exactly the same thing the pictures are different. Some show a strikingly attractive person, some an average-looking character, and some an unusually unattractive human being.

{"answer": 2, "choices": ["Proud.", "Frightened.", "Interested.", "Upset."], "question": "One cold day in winter, my wife and I were walking back home from the grocery store as usual when we suddenly decided to walk into a coffee shop. My wife ordered a coffee at the counter. Just then, I saw a young woman in her thirties helping with a rather weak Mexican woman into the shop. Maybe it was the gentleness of their difficult experiences or an unclear familiarity   with the situation that drew my full attention. I immediately had a strong wish to do something for them. Unfortunately, before I could think of anything reasonable to say, they left the coffee shop without ordering anything! When my wife returned, I told her about the two women and said, \"I missed the chance to do something for them.\" Strangely enough, though, they came back into the same coffee shop five minutes later. Unbelievable! \"This is my chance,\" I thought out loud as my wife shared some creative possibilities. The two women ordered, took their place card and left the counter. After quickly finishing our coffee, we walked up to the counter and asked the smiling cashier  , \"What is your most popular dessert  ?\" Chocolate Cake,\" she answered. With a childlike feeling of happiness, my wife made an unusual order. \"Can I buy a chocolate cake for the two women who were here just before us? But don't tell them it is from us. Just give them this card,\" she said while taking out a smile card. The cashier couldn't believe it. \" Do you do this all the time?\" she asked. \" Not all the time, but just whenever the heart calls for it,\" I answered with a natural smile. We, my wife and I, are people of middle income  . That night, we had planned to have our once-in-a-while dinner at a restaurant.

{"answer": 3, "choices": ["arms", "speech", "breathing", "heart"], "question": "Amyotrophic lateral sclerosis(ALS)   is a progressive neurodegenerative disease that affects nerve cells in the brain and the spinal cord. Motor neurons reach from the brain to the spinal cord and from the spinal cord to the muscles throughout the body. The progressive degeneration of the motor neurons in ALS eventually leads to _ death. When the motor neurons die, the ability of the brain to initiate and control muscle movement is lost. With voluntary  muscle action progressively affected, patients in the later stages of the disease may become totally paralyzed. A-myo-trophic comes from the Greek language. \"A\" means no or negative. \"Myo\" refers to muscle, and \"Trophic\" means nourishment--\"No muscle nourishment.\" When a muscle has no nourishment, it \"atrophies\" or wastes away. \"Lateral\" identifies the areas in a person's spinal cord where portions of the nerve cells that signal and control the muscles are located. As this area degenerates it leads to scarring or hardening (\"sclerosis\") in the region. As motor neurons degenerate, they can no longer send impulses to the muscle fibers that normally result in muscle movement. Early symptoms of ALS often include increasing muscle weakness, especially involving the arms and legs, speech, swallowing or breathing. When muscles no longer receive the messages from the motor neurons that they require to function, the muscles begin to atrophy (become smaller). Limbs begin to look \"thinner\" as muscle tissue atrophies. What Types of Nerves Make Your Body Work Properly? The body has many kinds of nerves. There are those involved in the process of thinking, memory, and of detecting sensations (such as hot/cold, sharp/dull), and others for vision, hearing, and other bodily functions. The nerves that are affected when you have ALS are the motor neurons that provide voluntary movements and muscle power. Examples of voluntary movements are your making the effort to reach for the phone or step off a curb; these actions are controlled by the muscles in the arms and legs. The heart and the digestive system are also made of muscle but a different kind, and their movements are not under voluntary control. When your heart beats or a meal is digested, it all happens automatically. Therefore, the heart and digestive system are not involved in ALS. Breathing also may seem to be involuntary. Remember, though, while you cannot stop your heart, you can hold your breath-so be aware that ALS may eventually have an impact on breathing. Although the cause of ALS is not completely understood, the recent years have brought a wealth of new scientific understanding regarding the physiology of this disease. While there is not a cure or treatment today that halts or reverses ALS, there is one FDA approved drug, riluzole, that modestly slows the progression of ALS as well as several other drugs in clinical trials that hold promise. Importantly, there are significant devices and therapies that can manage the symptoms of ALS that help people maintain as much independence as possible and prolong survival.

In 2002, former England international footballer Jeff Astle died aged 59. A coroner   said that Astle died from a brain disease likely to have been caused by \"repeated small damages to the brain\" related to heading a heavy leather football. Dr. Scott Delaney, research director of emergency medicine at McGill University Health Center in Montreal, Canada, has also researched soccer-related head injury and agrees that head-to-head or elbow-to-head blows are the real risk. In 2007, Delaney carried out a study on footballers aged between 12 and 17 that showed they were half as likely to be concussed   wearing headgear   than without. He said youngsters have a higher risk of head injury than adults because their heads are thinner and less able to absorb shock. To make matters worse, their neck muscles aren't as well developed and they often lack the correct heading technique that can help throw away the force of the ball. Delaney recommends that children wear headgear when playing football and says his two eldest children wear head protection playing the sport. But he admits that children can be unwilling to be the first to wear head protection--especially when their football heroes play without it. While headgear can protect footballers from being concussed during a match, no one knows the long-term effects of repeated \"sub-concussive\" blows to the head. Delaney says that while there is indirect evidence that a career in soccer can lead to dementia, no one has yet found a sure link between the two.

This sounds like a simple question. In daily life, we often make judgments about what is polite and what is not polite.

So politeness can first of all be regarded as a phenomenon, an observable social phenomenon. What I would like to propose is that as an observable social phenomenon, politeness is something superficial, but to account for what is understood at the surface, we should dig into the depth where different cultural values are rooted. When being complimented  , an English-speaking person would readily accept the compliment by saying something like \"Thank you\" to show his appreciation of the praise, but a Chinese speaker would try to deny the truth of the compliment. They both think they are behaving properly. Yet neither of them would think the other is being polite. The English speaker is being polite to the extent that by accepting and showing appreciation of the compliment, and he avoids hurting the positive face of the person who makes it; the Chinese speaker is showing modesty by  _ himself, ignoring the fact of the compliment paid to him. As has been mentioned, self-denigration has been at the core of the Chinese understanding of politeness for over two thousand years.

So politeness can first of all be regarded as a phenomenon, an observable social phenomenon. What I would like to propose is that as an observable social phenomenon, politeness is something superficial, but to account for what is understood at the surface, we should dig into the depth where different cultural values are rooted. When being complimented  , an English-speaking person would readily accept the compliment by saying something like \"Thank you\" to show his appreciation of the praise, but a Chinese speaker would try to deny the truth of the compliment. They both think they are behaving properly. Yet neither of them would think the other is being polite. The English speaker is being polite to the extent that by accepting and showing appreciation of the compliment, and he avoids hurting the positive face of the person who makes it; the Chinese speaker is showing modesty by  _ himself, ignoring the fact of the compliment paid to him. As has been mentioned, self-denigration has been at the core of the Chinese understanding of politeness for over two thousand years. The Chinese, in order to show modesty, will go to such lengths as to underrate what he himself has achieved and deny the truth of a complimentary remark. Which of the following is TRUE?", "subject": ""}

Once I had turned off the highway to start the last lap of my journey, I always had a sense of relief to see the hedge because it meant that I was almost home. On that particular evening, the hedge had just come into view when I saw something gray moving along the top of the hedge, moving toward the house. Upon closer observation, I realized it was the top of my father's head. Then I knew, each time I'd come home, he had stood behind the hedge, watching, until he knew I had arrived safely.

We can learn a lot from everyone. We always tend to think that we can only learn from those who are higher in status or have more knowledge than us, but that is not really the case. We learn from those who are lower in status than us as well, because the experience and knowledge of each person is very different. The best thing about _ learning, reflecting other people's strengths and shortcomings onto ourselves, is that we do not pay for the mistakes that are made. The only cost to us is the time that is needed to learn about and reflect on these lessons from other people's lives. As we all know, some mistakes can be ones which people cannot afford to make, for instance, a broken friendship or a financial loss. Thus constantly using other people's strengths and shortcomings to reflect upon ourselves makes us realize the costs of these mistakes and reduces the possibility that we will make similar mistakes. What can we do now to learn from others? By keeping our eyes and ears open. Be observant and able to realize what strengths and shortcomings other people have.

The study follows reports of cases where, for example, a dog showed great interest in a growth on the leg of its owner.The man was later found to be skin cancer. Carolyn Willis led a team of researchers at Amersham Hospital in England.They trained different kinds of dogs for the experiment.The study involved urine collected from bladder cancer patients, from people with other diseases and from healthy people. Each dog was tested 8 times.In each test there were 7 samples for the dogs to smell.The dog should signal the one from a bladder cancer patient by lying down next to it.Two cocker dogs were correct 56 percent of the time.But the scientists reported an average success rate of 41 percent. The British Medical Journal published the research.In all, 36 bladder cancer patients and 108 other people took part.During training, all the dogs reportedly even identified a cancer in a person who had tested healthy before the study.Doctors found a growth on the person's right kidney .

Sure, we need drinking water to live, but we have also benefited from what's swimming under the waves.  Neuroscientist Crawford of the University of North London has proposed that our ancient ancestors attached to the sea, and that their devotion paid off by allowing the human species to develop large and complex brains.  Crawford claims that when humans separated from apes and appeared in the forests of Africa, they stuck close to rivers and beaches and started catching fish, clams and crabs. That seafood was packed with omega-3 fatty acids, essential fatty acids that promote brain cell growth.  It's no coincidence, Crawford claims, that human brain growth began to increase rapidly once we left the woods and headed for the beach.   Scientists have also discovered that people who eat fish regularly are less likely to suffer from depression than those who eat less seafood.

{"answer": 3, "choices": ["It's good to our health to swim under the waves.", "Human has the largest and most complex brains.", "Beach is the best destination of vacation.", "It's human nature to seek out bodies of water."], "question": "Maps of the world's population show that the majority of people today live near water. We live along coastlines, around bays, up the course of rivers and streams and on islands. We also vacation at the beach and find comfort fishing on a lake. Nothing makes small children happier than the chance of playing in water.  More surprisingly, this human favor for water makes evolutionary sense. Sure, we need drinking water to live, but we have also benefited from what's swimming under the waves.  Neuroscientist Crawford of the University of North London has proposed that our ancient ancestors attached to the sea, and that their devotion paid off by allowing the human species to develop large and complex brains.  Crawford claims that when humans separated from apes and appeared in the forests of Africa, they stuck close to rivers and beaches and started catching fish, clams and crabs. That seafood was packed with omega-3 fatty acids, essential fatty acids that promote brain cell growth.  It's no coincidence, Crawford claims, that human brain growth began to increase rapidly once we left the woods and headed for the beach.   Scientists have also discovered that people who eat fish regularly are less likely to suffer from depression than those who eat less seafood. Biochemist Hibbelin of the National Institutes of Health has shown that across cultures there is a direct link between amount of fish eaten each week and rates of depression. More interestingly, Hibbelin and researcher Laura have found that fish is commonly used as a symbol of happiness and good health in various religions and cultures.  We know that fish and the sea are good for us, and so we seek them out. We vacation on the coast and see the waves come and go, feeling happiness has taken over our brain. When we move inland, or go home from vacation, we lose touch with our sea roots and feel unhappy. What can we infer from the passage?", "subject": ""}

Other than humans, they are the only animals known to do this, according to the study. The big difference with dolphins is that these communications consist of whistles , not words. Earlier research found that dolphins have a \"signature whistle\" that would be somewhat like human shouting, \"Hey everybody! I'm an adult healthy male named George, and I mean you no harm. \" The new finding is that dolphins also say the names of certain other dolphins. \"Animals produced copies of the same sound when they were separated from a close partner. This supports our belief that dolphins copy another animal's signature whistle when they want to reunite with that animal,\" Stephanie King, who led the study, says. King and her colleagues collected acoustic data from wild dolphins around Sarasota Bay, Florida, from 1984 to 2009. The researchers also studied four adult male dolphins _ at the Seas Aquarium, also in Florida. Those males are adults that keepers named Calvin, Khyber, Malabar and Ranier, all of whom, as well as all of the wild ones, developed their own signature whistles that served as names in communication with other dolphins. \"A dolphin uses its signature whistle to broadcast its identity and announce its presence. The signature whistles allow animals to identify one another over long distances and allow animals to recognize one another and to join up with each other,\" King explains. \"Dolphin whistles can be heard up to 20km away, depending on water depth and whistle frequency .\" The researchers said dolphins copy the signature whistles of loved ones, such as a mother, when the two are separated.

This might work for a few minutes, but by lunch time we are hungry. Eating a good breakfast sets the tone for the rest of the day. Having no breakfast is a popular way to lose weight, but not a smart one. Many people believe that they will lose weight if they have no meals, but that just isn't true; the body expects to be refueled a few times a day, starting with a healthy breakfast. Eating breakfast is good for losing weight. In fact, people who eat breakfast are more likely to keep a healthy weight. A healthy breakfast should have some protein   and some fiber  . Protein can come from low fat meats, eggs, or beans. Fiber can be found in whole grains, vegetables and fruits. A good example of a healthy breakfast might be something simple like a hard boiled egg, an orange, and a bowl of whole grain cereal with low fat milk. Stay away from sugary foods and white bread because they are digested   quickly and will leave you hungry and tired in several hours. Protein and fiber will keep you feeling full until lunch time.

But wouldn't it be kinder to the environment if you asked for paper bags instead? The answer is not the easy as it might seem. Environmentalists say there are _ to using both plastic bags and paper bags. According to the American Plastics Council 80 percent of groceries in the US are packed in plastic bags. \"The numbers are becoming huge,\" said Vincent Cobb, a businessman from Chicago who set up \"reusable bags. com\" on the Internet.

The psychologist K. Anders Ericsson of the University of Florida and his team, based on a survey of a violin class in a college of music, have found that the students whose levels are rated as \"A\" have spent on average over 10,000 hours on violin-practice, those with level B a bit less than 8,000 hours, and those with average or lower levels no more than 5,000 hours. The result of the survey is widely preferred because it suggests that practice makes perfect, that is, the distinction between \"excellent\" and \"good\" lies more in hard work than in natural intelligence. Malcolm Gladwell points out in his latest book Outliers: The Story of Success: \"Practice isn't the thing you do once you're good. It's the thing you do that makes you good.\" Besides, he thinks IQ plays little part in the formation and development of ability. \"When one has an IQ of 120,\" writes he, \"what is beyond it does not make an evidential difference in real life.\"  However, scientists' experimental results are quite different from the psychologists'. Their findings show success in many areas depends on intelligence --- and not a little. David Lubinski and Camilla Benbow of Vanderbilt University, with their research group, carried out a milestone research. They selected from Youth Talented Search 2000 teenagers of or under 13 whose SAT results ranked top1%.

Lenny went to the river to see what was happening. Then he saw a woman in the ice-cold water. Suddenly Lenny did not feel afraid. He kept very calm and did a very courageous thing. He jumped into the Potomac, swam to the woman, and kept her head above the water. Seventy-eight people died that day. Thanks to Lenny Sputnik, it was not seventy-nine. When you are in a very dangerous situation and feel afraid, the body automatically produces a chemical in the blood. This chemical is called adrenalin.

When this happens, the muscles become very hard and you find that you cannot move at all. You are then disabled with fear. That is why, when we are very frightened, we sometimes say that we are 'petrified'. This word comes from the Greek word 'peters' which means 'stone'. We are so frightened we have become like stone.

The idea of Father's Day came from the love and appreciation of American lady called Sonore Smart Dodd in 1909. Dodd wanted a special day to honor her father, William Smart. He raised six children by himself on a countryside farm in Washington State after his wife died during the birth of their sixth child. When Dodd became an adult, she realized the selflessness her father has shown in raising his children as a single parent. It was her father who did all for his children. In the eyes of his daughter, William Smart was a courageous, selfless and loving man. Dodd's father was born in June, so she chose to hold the first Father's Day celebration in Washington on June 19th, 1910. In 1924, US President Calvin Coolidge supported the idea of a national Father's Day. Finally, in 1966, President Lyndon Johnson declared the third Sunday of June as Father's day. So this is a perfect chance to let your father know what he means to you. To show your love and respect, you need not buy an expensive gift. You can send him a home - made card; You can call him every day; Even you can give him a sweet smile when he comes back from work.

Chen draws a clear line between himself and those who skip classes in order to get more sleep or fool around on campus. He emphasized:\"I skip classes with a clear goal,which is to probe into areas I'm interested in and broaden my horizons.\" Li Sicen,President of the National Taiwan University,seems to be on Chen's side.  Li claimed that he supported those students who skip classes for good reasons. However,Professor Xiao warns students that Li is not giving permission for students to skip  classes. Xiao suggests that Li was just showing his understanding of truancy in a limited number of cases. In Professor Pan Cuiqiong's opinion,students tend to jump to the conclusion that a certain course is boring and useless. \"To clear students' misunderstanding,teachers should use materials closely related to students'lives and adapt interactive teaching methods,\"said Pan. Besides offering teachers more training,schools also need to give students different optional courses and ensure that they can attend the courses they are interested in,according to  Professor  Xiao.  Many Chinese students have the experience of being kicked out of an optional course because its size is limited. They are then forced to choose courses they dislike and are likely to skip them. We may learn from Sydney University in Australia.  There aren't any problems with numbers---if a course is popular then there will be more than one class per week.

Panning   for gold has a rich and interesting history. Nowadays some people continue to pan for gold in California. Although it cannot be regarded as a method for earning income, taking on gold-panning as a hobby can give you a feeling of being in the old west and get you out into nature. The only tool that is required to pan for gold is a gold pan. You can use a regular old flat pan, but \"officially\" gold pans are quite cheap so you may as well buy one that is made for the task. Most sold pans come in either plastic or medal. Once you have your pan you will want to start practicing your gold panning technique. Panning for gold works because gold is much heavier than most rocks. To pan for gold you add rock and dirt form the bottom of a stream to your pan and then gently let water flow through the pan. The lighter-weight rocks are slowly swept away while any gold will be left behind in the pan. To start panning for gold, first you will need to find a good location. Try checking maps of your area and old history books to find location where there were gold mines in the past. Even though most of the gold have already been removed, there are likely to be small leftovers that you can find. Once you have found an area that looks promising, look for any small stream or river where you can try out panning for gold. Panning for gold requires patience and it may be a long time before you hit anything of value. However, it is an enjoyable hobby and provides a great opportunity to get outdoors, so don't give up too quickly. What is the author's attitude toward modern gold-planning?", "subject": ""}

{"answer": 3, "choices": ["Because grocery stores without shopping carts made less money.", "Because he lowered the prices of his goods.", "Because customers liked the shopping cart's creative design.", "Because customers were able to carry more items when shopping."], "question": "The modern world is full of useful objects that were invented by someone, from spoons and  chopsticks in our kitchens to the Ipads in our handbags. Each invention is an example of the creative power of the human mind. Where do inventors get their inspirations ? The inspiration behind  each of these inventions varies. Take the shopping cart as an example. Sylvan Goldman was a grocery store owner. Like most businessmen, he wished that his customers would buy more so that he could make more money. He knew what if they could carry more goods easily as they were shopping, when his sales would go up. While thinking about the problem one night, he had an idea. Working with a local handyman named  Fred Young, he designed the first shopping cart. Today, retailers who use shopping carts sell more goods and make more profits. Nature has also inspired inventors throughout history. This is what happened to George de  Mestral one day. While hunting with his dog in the Swiss Alps, he noticed how the burs  of  certain plants stuck to his clothing and to his dog' s fur. After examining them under a microscope, he found they had tiny hooks that could easily stick to the fibers of clothing or animal hide. For the next ten years, George de Mestral searched for the hest way to produce his idea.

They become friends while pursuing love and career advancement. Since its appearance on April 18, Ode to Joy has been praised for its realistic description of the hidden struggles of city life. \"The audience can relate to the characters since their experiences can be traced back to real life too,\" commented the Dahe Daily. \"Even better, female audiences can find themselves in one or two of the characters because the characters _ feminine archetypes  found throughout the society.\"But the idea of following a group of women as they lead a city life is hardly a pioneering concept. In many ways, Ode to Joy resembles American TV series like Sex and the City (1998-2004) and Desperate Housewives (2004-2012). These two series were praised for their feminist themes, but they also employed well-known female archetypes to illustrate the range of dilemmas women face. Deborah A. Macey, a communications professor at Saint Louis University in the US, divides these archetypes up into four ways: the iron maiden, the sex object, the child,and the mother. \"The iron maiden is portrayed as masculine and career-oriented. The sex object owns her sexuality and genuinely loves her body. The child archetype is naive, optimistic, and dim-witted. The mother archetype connects the characters in the series and serves as the dominant storyteller,\" Macey said on the online media forum \"In Media Res\". Sounds familiar? Yes, these features can be seen in the characters of Ode toJoy. Andy (Liu Tao), for instance, partly embodies the iron maiden role. She's super smart, rational and direct.

Despite the fact that she s in charge of her own family issues,she takes her friends under her wing and stands up for them. Qu Xiaoxiao (Wang ziwen), the sexy and beautiful girl born with silver spoon, perfectly illustrates what is bitter-sweet relationship between friends and lovers. With that being said. Ode to Joy doesn't lack creativity. It assigns the \"child\" role to two characters-the straightforward, naive Qiu Yingying (Yang Zi), and the good-tempered, hard-working Guan Ju'er (Qiao Xin).

They asked Hemi, the God of the sea, to help them. So Hemi tried to catch Ratu the next time he flew into the sea, but he was too slow. Ratu laughed at Hemi as he flew past him. This made Hemi angry and he had an idea. He asked the fishes to bring him a lot of seaweed. Hemi tied it all together and made a large net from it. Soon Ratu flew down and Hemi threw the net over him. Ratu fought and fought but could not get free. He was caught. Ratu promised   never to frighten fishes again if Hemi would set him free. But Hemi did not believe him. Instead, he changed Ratu into a mountain in the sea. Ratu was so angry that when he opened his mouth to shout at Hemi, fire and smoke broke out. And that is why the Island of Ratu is a volcano  . The main point of the story seems to be that   _  .", "subject": ""}

But Winograd's wife, Jennifer, also an animal lover, was all for it. So they packed everything they owned, and with two young children, plus two dogs, and a bunch of cats Winograd had rescued, drove cross--country. On the second day, they had no room for six more puppies they received. They found an old horse trough, filled it with hay and nestled the animals inside. They placed it next to the front desk, and within a day or two, all six had homes, adopted by people who walked into the shelter and couldn't resist. Blind dogs, cats with missing limbs--all find homes. \"There is no dog or cat too old,  too ugly or too undesirable not to be adopted by someone,\" says Winograd.     Today, Tompkins County is considered the only no-kill county in the United States. Nine out of ten dogs cats that come through the shelter doors are saved. Only animals with incurable injuries or illnesses, and the truly evil, are put down. The national average is half of all dogs and 70 percent of cats, totaling more than four million animals last year alone. Even though he drives an old car that leaks when it rains, and his family lives on a tight budget while his classmates from Stanford Law earn six-figure salaries, Winograd says he's doing what he'd always wanted to do when he grew up; run an animal shelter and save all the animals. As a young district lawyer, he kept his goal in mind, starting when he raised his first animal cruelty case. A man was accused of intentionally setting his brown cat on fire. Winograd made his case, and the abusive owner was sentenced to prison. It was the first of many such cases, and he raised each with vigor. But the senseless violence, neglect and ignorance never failed to shock him. He decided simply, \"I need to get to the other side and start saving these animals.\" Now, Winograd is helping to save thousands, even millions, \"I'm convinced that a no kill nation is possible, I'm just here trying to shorten the time until it arrives.\" What was his father's response when Nathan Winograd left his job as a lawyer in California?", "subject": ""}

As a young district lawyer, he kept his goal in mind, starting when he raised his first animal cruelty case. A man was accused of intentionally setting his brown cat on fire. Winograd made his case, and the abusive owner was sentenced to prison. It was the first of many such cases, and he raised each with vigor. But the senseless violence, neglect and ignorance never failed to shock him. He decided simply, \"I need to get to the other side and start saving these animals.\" Now, Winograd is helping to save thousands, even millions, \"I'm convinced that a no kill nation is possible, I'm just here trying to shorten the time until it arrives.\" How did Winograd successfully save so many animals?", "subject": ""}
{"answer": 2, "choices": ["Being Rich is Important", "Animals, Our Best Friends", "No Pet Left behind", "The Winograd Family"], "question": "When Nathan Winograd announced that he was leaving his job as a lawyer in California to run an animal shelter in Tompkins County, New York, his father looked at him for a long minute and then asked, \"What do dogs and cats need a lawyer for?\" The move meant giving up eight weeks' vacation, an office with a view of the San Francisco Bay and a big house among the redwoods, and moving to a rural area know for its harsh winters. But Winograd's wife, Jennifer, also an animal lover, was all for it. So they packed everything they owned, and with two young children, plus two dogs, and a bunch of cats Winograd had rescued, drove cross--country. On the second day, they had no room for six more puppies they received. They found an old horse trough, filled it with hay and nestled the animals inside. They placed it next to the front desk, and within a day or two, all six had homes, adopted by people who walked into the shelter and couldn't resist. Blind dogs, cats with missing limbs--all find homes. \"There is no dog or cat too old,  too ugly or too undesirable not to be adopted by someone,\" says Winograd.     Today, Tompkins County is considered the only no-kill county in the United States. Nine out of ten dogs cats that come through the shelter doors are saved. Only animals with incurable injuries or illnesses, and the truly evil, are put down. The national average is half of all dogs and 70 percent of cats, totaling more than four million animals last year alone.

The five languages of apology include: Apology Language 1: \"I am sorry.\" List the hurtful effects of your action. Not \"I am sorry if ...\", but \"I am sorry that...\". You might ask if they want to add any points that you have not recognized. Apology Language 2:\"I was wrong.\"      Name your mistake and accept fault. Note that it is easier to say \"You are right\" than \" I am wrong\", but the latter carries more weight. Apology Language 3: \" What can I do to make it right?\"      How are you now? How shall I make amends  to you? How can I restore your confidence that I love you-- even though I was so hurtful to you? Apology Language 4: \"I'll try not to do that again.\"      Engage in problem-solving. Don't make excuses for yourself such as, \"Well, my day was just so...\" Instead, offer what you will change to prevent yourself from putting them in the same bad situation again. Apology Language 5: \"Will you please forgive me?\"       Be patient in seeking forgiveness. They may need some time or greater clarification of your input from Apology Languages 1-4.

The word \"supermoon\" was introduced in a report by the British newspaper Daily Mail on March 9, which said amateur scientists were warning that such an astronomical phenomenon could disturb the Earth's climate patterns and may even cause earthquakes and volcanic activity. The moon will be 356,577 kilometers from the Earth on Saturday, the closest in 19 years, and the closest point in its oval orbit coincides  with a full moon, the report said. However, Saturday's moon is not actually the closest to Earth in 19 years, Tang Haiming, an astronomer with Shanghai Astronomical Observatory under the Chinese Academy of Sciences, told Xinhua News Agency. A shorter distance of 356,570 km between the two bodies was reached in January 2005, and a distance of 356,566 km was seen in December 2008. Yet some people suggest that previous supermoons have occurred prior to extreme weather events.

Coincidentally, two fresh disasters happened in Asia right before Saturday's supermoon.

One major branch of physics deals with the states of matter--solids,liquids and gases and with their motions.The pioneer achievements of Galileo,Kepler and Newton dealt with solid masses of matter in motion.Such studies deal with forces acting on moving objects.It is the subject of mechanics and belongs to the branch of mechanics called dynamics,the study of matter in motion.This large topic includes not only the motions of stars and ping-pong balls but also the motions of the water pumped by a fire engine and those of the air passing through the jet engine of an airplane. A branch of mechanics is statics ,the study of matter at rest.The designs of buildings and bridges are examples of problems in statics.Other branches of physics are based on the different kinds of energy,which interact with matter.They deal with electricity and magnetism ,heat,light,and sound.From these branches of physics scientists find clues  which have revealed  the constructions of atoms and how the atoms react to various kinds of energy. _ is often called the basis of modern physics.Among the many subdivisions of modern physics are electronics and nuclear physics.Physics is closely related to engineering.A person who uses knowledge of physics in solving everyday problems is often called an engineer.For example,electricity is one of the branches of physics;and an electrical engineer is a man who uses the \"natural laws\" of electricity to help in designing and electric generator .

Two patients underwent kidney transplants at the Shifa, Gaza's biggest public hospital. The operations were conducted a fortnight ago by a volunteer medical team from the Royal Liverpool hospital. Ziad Matouk, 42, was born with one kidney and was diagnosed with renal failure several years ago. Matouk, whose wife donated one of her kidneys, hopes to return to his job within six months. The couple had sought a transplant in Cairo, but were rejected as unsuitable at a state hospital and could not afford the fee at a private hospital. \"We were desperate,\" said Matouk.

The Shifa is forced to rely on generators because of power cuts; spare parts for its ageing dialysis machines have been difficult to import; and supplies of consumables are often scarce.

The couple had sought a transplant in Cairo, but were rejected as unsuitable at a state hospital and could not afford the fee at a private hospital. \"We were desperate,\" said Matouk. The UK-Gaza link-up began about a year ago after Abdelkader Hammad, a doctor at the Royal Liverpool hospital, was contacted by an anaesthetist at the Shifa, who outlined the difficulties the Gaza hospital was facing with dialysis . The Shifa is forced to rely on generators because of power cuts; spare parts for its ageing dialysis machines have been difficult to import; and supplies of consumables are often scarce. After an exploratory trip last April, Hammad---whose family is Palestinian---and three colleagues from Liverpool arrived in Gaza via Egypt last month, bringing specialist equipment. Two patients were selected for surgery. The first, Mohammed Duhair, 42, received a kidney donated by his younger brother in a six-hour operation. Two days later, Matouk received a transplant after his wife, Nadia, 36, was found to be a good match. The surgeon was carried out by the British team, assisted by doctors and nurses from the Shifa. \"We are very satisfied with the results,\" said Sobbi Skaik, head of surgery at the Gaza hospital. Skaik hopes that Gaza medical teams will eventually carry out kidney transplants independently, and that other organ transplants may follow. The Shifa is working with the Gaza ministry of health on a plan to train its doctors, surgeons, nursing staff and laboratory technicians in transplant surgery at the Royal Liverpool. \"Funding is a problem,\" said Hammad. \"In the meantime we'll go back as volunteers to Gaza for the next couple of years to do more transplants.\" The Liverpool team's next visit is scheduled for May.

A music player stores songs, albums and playlists. A computer holds schoolwork and programs and remembers how far a player has advanced in his or her favorite game. Mobile phones store names, numbers and hundreds of texts. Now, scientists in California say they have come up with a way to turn a living cell into a memory device. It can store only one tiny bit of information, but it's a start. In the future, a cell-based gadget might travel through the body and record measurements. The benefit to human health could be big: the right tool, for example, might record the earliest signs of disease. Doctors, scientists and other curious people want to know what is happening inside the body, even at levels that can't be seen by the naked eye. So far, there is no device small enough to travel through the bloodstream. If normal machines won't do the trick, perhaps biology will. Scientists who work in the field of synthetic   biology are trying to find ways to turn living things into human tools. In the case of the new memory device, bioengineers from Stanford University used the genetic material inside living cells to record information. This genetic material consists of DNA. Found in nearly every cell, DNA carries all of the information that keeps a living thing alive. In the new experiment, the researchers turned DNA from bacteria  into a switch.

{"answer": 0, "choices": ["It has a very small memory.", "It can function as a computer.", "It has one letter in it.", "It takes a day to complete it."], "question": "Every electronic gadget   needs good memory. A music player stores songs, albums and playlists. A computer holds schoolwork and programs and remembers how far a player has advanced in his or her favorite game. Mobile phones store names, numbers and hundreds of texts. Now, scientists in California say they have come up with a way to turn a living cell into a memory device. It can store only one tiny bit of information, but it's a start. In the future, a cell-based gadget might travel through the body and record measurements. The benefit to human health could be big: the right tool, for example, might record the earliest signs of disease. Doctors, scientists and other curious people want to know what is happening inside the body, even at levels that can't be seen by the naked eye. So far, there is no device small enough to travel through the bloodstream. If normal machines won't do the trick, perhaps biology will. Scientists who work in the field of synthetic   biology are trying to find ways to turn living things into human tools. In the case of the new memory device, bioengineers from Stanford University used the genetic material inside living cells to record information. This genetic material consists of DNA. Found in nearly every cell, DNA carries all of the information that keeps a living thing alive. In the new experiment, the researchers turned DNA from bacteria  into a switch. They \"flip  \" a small section of DNA. Then, using the same procedure   , the scientists flip the section again--returning it into its normal structure.

Melting glaciers and polar ice are causing sea levels to rise, putting the Maldives and other low-lying areas at risk of being swallowed by the sea within the next 100 years.      What can be done? Scientists and leaders from 190 nations will try to figure that out at the United Nations climate change conference next month. The main goal of the meeting is to come up with a new climate agreement for 2012 and beyond. That is when the existing plan, the Kyoto Protocol will expire. The agreement was created in Kyoto, Japan, in 1997. Since then, it has been ratified  by 190 nations. The countries promised to limit the amount of greenhouse gases, such as carbon dioxide, that they produced each year.      The debate over who should cut greenhouse emissions has been going on for years. The US has been hesitant to reduce emissions unless fast-growing nations such as China and India also reduce their use of fossil fuels. In recent months, China has taken steps to be greener.

However, there was a time when people didn't give it out to each other. The history of the high five isn't very long. It's even been said that the first high five was given out in a 1977 Los Angeles Dodgers game between Dusty Baker and Glen Burke as a way to celebrate Baker's home run  . After this first sighting of the high five in 1977, Derek Smith, a player on the 1980 Lousiville Cardinals basketball team, invented the actual \"high five\", which the team used all throughout the season as a way to congratulate one another. After the Cardinals began to use the high five, more and more sports teams began to replace other popular celebratory gestures of the time, such as a pat on the back or the behind, with the high five. As you can probably guess, it didn't take long for the high five to make its way all across the sports scene and into the daily lives of every American who wanted a new and interesting way to congratulate or say hello to their friends, co-workers and family. The high five is here to stay and can be seen in more places and situations than ever before in history. People use it in the bar, the gym, the office or sometimes on the street.

Next morning, just before he left, as if asking a great favor, he said, \"Could I come back and stay the next time?\" He added, \"Your children made me feel at home.\" On his next trip he arrived a little after seven in the morning. As a gift, he brought a big fish and the largest oysters   I had ever seen. I knew his bus left at 4:00 a.m. and I wondered what time he had to get up in order to do this for us. In the years he came to stay overnight with us and there was never a time that he did not bring us vegetables from his garden. I know our family always will be grateful to have known him; from him we learned how to accept the bad without complaint when facing the misfortune.

Experts say so far there is no reason to worry, and point out that we meet radiation every day. Where and how? NPR's Renee Montagne posed that question to Peter Caracappa, a radiation safety officer and professor of nuclear engineering. MONTAGNE: How many things emit radiation? Dr CARACAPPA: Well, radiation and radioactive material is a part of nature. So everything that's living has some amount of radiation coming from it--a very small amout. Plus there's radiation in the ground and the air. So the extremes are uranium in the soil to bananas? Yes. By the way, why do bananas have radiation? Bananas have a lot of potassium . And a small amount of potassium naturally is called potassium 40, which is radioactive What's the difference between radiation that's harmful and not harmful? Well, the term radiation can apply to a lot of different things. But the harmful radiation is ionizing radiation. It has enough energy that it can make chemical changes in material. We could get ionizing radiation from an X-ray, for example. It's the kind of radiation that causes cancer. The broader definition of radiation includes a lot of things that we call non-ionizing radiation. That includes everything like radio waves and visible light and your microwave. So what then is the largest contributor of ionizing radiation? For the natural sources of ionizing radiation, actually the biggest chunk of that tends to come from radon , which is a radioactive material that is present in the air. It can become a concern when it builds up in low-lying areas of homes like basements. Would it be fair to say that most people do not need to worry about the danger of being exposed to radiation?

A lot of people are angry at the billionaires who are not willing to give away their fortunes. They  _ hem for being miserly and not caring about the poor and the less fortunate. But I think this criticism is wrong. A gift, any gift, should come from the heart. Instead of criticism, these reluctant billionaires should be encouraged to follow the examples of Yu Pengnian and Chen Guangbiao. Encouragement is always a better strategy than criticism.

He completed the task in just a few minutes at the show, which was held in Beijing last Saturday. Just imagine the tiny parts that make up a watch. You have to wonder how the disabled man developed such a skill. It was reported that 28-year-old Wang Jianghai lost his arms in an accident when he was five and began learning to repair watches at the age of 17. He has repaired more than 10,000 watches in the past 11 years.  What strong self-confidence he must have to overcome the difficulties in getting this skill! What optimism he must have to face the unfairness of his hard life! And what strong determination he must have to go through the hardship in his struggle for a normal life! Such confidence, optimism and willpower are exactly the qualities many physically healthy people lack nowadays. Wang has set a good example for young people.  But today's youth seem to be more interested with their TV stars and pop singers but less interested in learning from the examples of working and studying hard to achieve higher goals. . That is undoubtedly the result of the influence of a changing social atmosphere. One must admit that there is a trend towards  _ in our society. People are increasingly more concerned about material gains than about spiritual pursuits. While adults know they must work hard whatever way they choose to materialize the gains, the younger generation are more likely to seek ease and comforts of their senses. This pleasure-seeking trend provides a huge market for the entertainment industry and the mass media. The media devote excessive too much coverage to anecdotes of pop and TV stars, which in turn fans wider and stronger enthusiasm for entertainment among the public, especially young people.  Ours is a developing country. Global competition in the growth of national strength presents a demand for China to be quicker in its development. We cannot afford to lose time. We need to make our economy more powerful. To meet this need, all of us should maintain our tradition of working hard and overcoming difficulties.

The government will require Beijingers to get licenses for their dogs, and will enforce the one-dog, one-family policy. Police say the \"one-dog policy\" is aimed at reducing the number of dog bites and lowering the risk of rabies.

Pet owners are also required to clean up their dog's droppings and make sure dogs are leashed  , especially in public areas. Some public areas, such as banks, are closed to dogs entirely. Dogs are regarded as man's best friend and the history of raising dogs can be traced back to the stone age. It therefore seems sad that dogs are unwelcome in Beijing. But it is not the case that Beijingers dislike dogs. Actually, there are many dog lovers in Beijing. The city now has more than 550,000 registered dogs, up 20 percent from the previous year. The problem is, actually, about living space. Different from many Westerners, most Beijingers live in urban apartment buildings, not houses in the suburbs.

Teaching is one job where the differences between men's and women's ways of talking show.When a man teaches a woman,says Professor Tannen,he wants to show that he has more knowledge,and hence(,)more power in conversation.When a woman teaches another woman,however,she is more likely to take a sharing approach and to encourage her student to join in. But Professor Tannen does not believe that women are naturally more helpful.She says women feel they achieve power by being able to help others.Although the research suggests men talk and interrupt people more than women,Professor Tannen says,women actually encourage this to happen because they believe it will lead to more intimacy and help to establish a relationship. Some scientists who are studying speech think that the brain is pre-programmed for language.As we are usually taught to speak by women,it seems that the brain must have a sexual bias in its programming,otherwise male speech patterns would not arise at all.

College will be the most important years in your life. It is in college that you will truly discover what learning is about. You often question \"what good is this course\". I encourage you to be inquisitive  , but I also want to tell you: \"Education is what you have left after all that is taught is forgotten.\" What I mean by that is -- the material taught isn't as important as you gaining the ability to learn a new subject, and the ability to analyze a new problem.  Do your best in classes, but don't let pressure get to you. If you graduate and learn something in your four years, we would feel happy. Your Columbia degree will take you far, even if you don't graduate with honors. So please don't give yourself pressure. The only thing that matters is that you learned. The only measurement you should use is that you tried.  Most importantly, make friends and be happy. College friends are often the best in life, because during college you are closer to them physically than to your family. Also, going through independence and adulthood is a natural bonding   experience. Pick a few friends and become really close to them -- pick the ones who are genuine and sincere to you. Don't worry about their hobbies, grades, looks, or even personalities. If you think you like someone, tell her. You have very little to lose.

I suppose that I pictured her as a little girl, and treated her like one in order to hold onto and preserve my own youth. Until I saw her in her wedding dress I still had a vision of her with chubby little cheeks and long, dark-brown pigtails  blowing in the wind, perhaps even a permanent smudge of chocolate around her pink lips. I guess it's true that you see only what you want to see. Where did this beautiful woman with the glowing complexion and gentle curves  come from? I was happy that day, and also sad. Gone were the days of me bossingher around and telling her what she should do with her life. My bossy behavior had earned me the nickname Lucy. If you are a Peanuts fan then you can clearly imagine my behavior as an older sister. To me it wasn't an insult; I rather like the nickname Lucy. I happen to think that Lucy is strong and has incredible self-confidence, although she is a little overbearing  at times. I did my best to live up to the standards set forth by this dynamic cartoon character. I left the reception to get some air because suddenly I was overcome with grief at the realization that I was no longer a child. I went outside and walked to a nearby playground where there were children playing on the slide, the swings and digging in the dirt. There was a little girl twirlingaround on a bar, one knee wrapped tightly around the bar and fashioned behind her knee. It was all I could do to sit there and just watch, for I too wanted to get on that bar with her and see if I could still hold the all-timetwirlingrecord (ninety-nine times in fifth grade). Somewhere inside I knew that I would break my neck, and I was wearing abridesmaiddress. Not exactly playground material. And so I sat watching the children play. I'm not sure how long I sat there before my sister came and joined me. We talked about how we are grown up now and shed a few tears for our childhood days gone by. As she wiped a tear from my eye she lovingly said, \"you'll always be Lucy to me.\" We hugged. My cousin Mike walked over and told my sister that it was time to cut the cake.

He took my sister's arm and turned to head back for the reception hall. \"Coming?\" They asked. \"In a minute.\" I replied, and sat back down on the bench, dizzy from what he had just told me. Dead? How could Charles Schultz be dead? He was my creator! And though I have never met the man personally, he has always been like an invisible father to me.

Innocence slipped away from me like a thief in the night: come and gone before I could do anything about it, taking with it all the treasures that I held most valuable in my heart.

Ray pretended to buy a car, rent an apartment, and apply for a credit card.  Then, she and her classmates played the \"stock market game\", investing  the hypothetical  earnings from their hypothetical jobs in the market in the disastrous fall of 2008. \"Our pretend investments crashed,\" Ray says, still frightened. \"We got to know how it felt to lose money.\" That pain of earning and losing money is a feeling that public schools increasingly want to teach. Forty states now offer some type of financial instruction at the high-school level, teaching students how to balance checkbooks and buy stock in math and social-studies classes. Though it's too early to measure the full influence of the Great Recession , the interest in personal-finance classes has risen since 2007 when bank failures started to occur regularly. Now, many states including Missouri, Utah, and Tennessee require teenagers to take financial classes to graduate from high school. School districts such as Chicago are encouraging money-management classes for kids as young as primary school, and about 300 colleges or universities now offer online personal-finance classes for incoming students. \"These classes really say, 'This is how you live independently,' \" says Ted Beck, president of National Endowment for Financial Education. Rather than teach investment methods or financial skills, these courses offer a back-to-the-basics approach to handling money: Don't spend what you don't have. Put part of your monthly salary into a savings account, and invest in the stock market for the long-term rather than short-term gains. For Ray, this means dividing her earnings from her part-time job at a fast-food restaurant into separate envelopes for paying bills, spending and saving.  \"Money is so hard to make but so easy to spend,\" she says one weekday after school. \"That is the big takeaway.\" Teaching kids about the value of cash certainly is one of the programs' goals, but teachers also want students to think hard about their finances long term. It's easy for teenagers to get annoyed about gas prices because many of them drive cars. But the hard part is urging them to put off the instant satisfaction of buying a new T-shirt or an iPod. \"Investing and retirement aren't things teenagers are thinking about. For them, the future is this weekend,\" says Gayle Whitefield, a business and marketing teacher at Uth's Riverton High School. That's a big goal for these classes: preventing kids from making the same financial missteps their parents did when it comes to saving, spending, and debt. Though the personal savings rate has increased up to 4. 2 percent, that's still a far distance from 1982, when Americans saved 11. 2 percent of their incomes. \"It's hard for schools to reach strict money-management skills when teenagers go home and watch their parents increase credit-card debt. It's like telling your kids not to smoke and then lighting up a cigarette in front of them,\" Beck says. Even with these challenges, students such as Ray say learning about money in school is worthwhile. After Ray finished her financial class, she opened up a savings account at her local bank and started to think more about how she and her family would pay for college. \"She just has a better understanding of money and how it affects the world,\" says her mother, Darleen-and that's sown to the details of how money is spent from daily expenses to various taxes.

School districts such as Chicago are encouraging money-management classes for kids as young as primary school, and about 300 colleges or universities now offer online personal-finance classes for incoming students. \"These classes really say, 'This is how you live independently,' \" says Ted Beck, president of National Endowment for Financial Education. Rather than teach investment methods or financial skills, these courses offer a back-to-the-basics approach to handling money: Don't spend what you don't have. Put part of your monthly salary into a savings account, and invest in the stock market for the long-term rather than short-term gains. For Ray, this means dividing her earnings from her part-time job at a fast-food restaurant into separate envelopes for paying bills, spending and saving.  \"Money is so hard to make but so easy to spend,\" she says one weekday after school. \"That is the big takeaway.\" Teaching kids about the value of cash certainly is one of the programs' goals, but teachers also want students to think hard about their finances long term. It's easy for teenagers to get annoyed about gas prices because many of them drive cars. But the hard part is urging them to put off the instant satisfaction of buying a new T-shirt or an iPod. \"Investing and retirement aren't things teenagers are thinking about. For them, the future is this weekend,\" says Gayle Whitefield, a business and marketing teacher at Uth's Riverton High School. That's a big goal for these classes: preventing kids from making the same financial missteps their parents did when it comes to saving, spending, and debt. Though the personal savings rate has increased up to 4. 2 percent, that's still a far distance from 1982, when Americans saved 11. 2 percent of their incomes. \"It's hard for schools to reach strict money-management skills when teenagers go home and watch their parents increase credit-card debt. It's like telling your kids not to smoke and then lighting up a cigarette in front of them,\" Beck says. Even with these challenges, students such as Ray say learning about money in school is worthwhile. After Ray finished her financial class, she opened up a savings account at her local bank and started to think more about how she and her family would pay for college. \"She just has a better understanding of money and how it affects the world,\" says her mother, Darleen-and that's sown to the details of how money is spent from daily expenses to various taxes. All of this talk of money can make Ray worry, she says, but luckily, she feels prepared to face it. The passage is mainly about  _  .", "subject": ""}

But people in other countries, including India, have been taking advantages of their nutritional benefits for many years. While the flesh of a banana is soft and sweet, the skin is thick, hard and slightly bitter. To eat the peel, you can fry, bake, or boil it for at least 10 minutes. Also, the riper bananas get, the thinner and sweeter banana peel will become. That's because of a natural plant hormone  called ethylene  that fruits release as they ripen. Ethylene interacts with the sugars and fiber in the banana skin, changing complex sugars into simple sugars and breaking down pectin, a form of fiber in bananas that keeps them stiff. That's why the older your banana is, the flimsier  it feels. The sweet flesh of a medium-sized banana contains great percentages of your daily recommended intake of various nutrients, such as: *12% of your daily fiber, which helps with digestion and may help lower your risk of diabetes  *17% of your vitamin C, which is important for your immune system as well as your growth *20% of your vitamin B6, which aids the body's ability to turn food into energy *12% of your potassium, which helps with the development of cells, tissues, and organs throughout the body If you eat the skin along with the flesh, you will get an even bigger increase in these same nutrients. Eating the peel is not only good for your body but also better for the earth. The average American ate 11.4 pounds of bananas in 2014. Since a medium-sized banana weighs about 0.3 pounds, that equates to about 38 bananas per person, or about 12 billion for the whole of the U.S. And since most of us throw away the peel, that also means a lot of organic waste.

Like others, I have described it to people as \"broken\" English. But I feel embarrassed to say that. It has always bothered me that I can think of no way to describe it other than\"broken\", as if it were damaged and needed to be fixed, as if it lacked a certain wholeness. I've heard other terms used, \"limited English,\" for example. But they seem just as bad, as if everything is limited, including people's perceptions of the limited English speaker. I know this for a fact, because when I was growing up, my mother's \"limited\" English limited my perception of her. I was ashamed of her English. I believed that her English reflected the quality of what she had to say. That is, because she expressed them imperfectly her thoughts were imperfect. And I had plenty of evidence to support me: the fact that people in department stores, at banks, and at restaurants did not take her seriously, did not give her good service, pretended not to understand her, or even acted as if they did not hear her. I started writing fiction in 1985. And for reasons I won't get into today, I began to write stories using all the Englishes I grew up with: the English she used with me, which for lack of a better term might be described as \"broken\" ; and what I imagine to be her translation of her Chinese, her internal   language, and for that I sought to preserve the essence, but neither an English nor a Chinese structure. I wanted to catch what language ability tests can never show: her intention, her feelings, the rhythms of her speech and the nature of her thoughts. What is the passage mainly about?", "subject": ""}

What's amazing is not that the pieces sold for so much, but the fact that they are not what you would call traditional art.

Well, if you're a dog-owner, you may have a point. Dogs are able to watch people's interactions with one another to determine who holds yummier treats, according to a new study. This study joins others that show dogs are good observers of human behaviors and feelings. It offers evidence that dogs use information not only from people's direct interactions with them, but also their interactions with one another. In the study, dogs watched a man ask two women for some of their corns. Both women gave the man corns when he asked, but in response to one woman, the man showed his enthusiasm and said the corns were so delicious. In response to the other woman, he gave the corns back and called them _ (in Spanish;the study was conducted in Argentina). After these interactions, the man left and an assistant holding the dog let the dog go. While many dogs didn't approach either woman, the dogs that did have a preference tended to prefer the woman with the yummier  food. Other studies of dogs' people-watching ability have found dogs are able to tell the difference between happy and sad faces in their owners. They prefer people who give others food when asked over people who don't give others food. And in one study, dogs turned toward crying people more often than toward talking people. So how much do dogs really understand about the humans around them? That's not totally settled yet. In a strange twist to the Argentine study above, when the researchers tried an experiment in which they put two plates of corns on a table and had a man react to each plate, dogs didn't preferentially approach the tastier plate afterward. You could say dogs watch for the interaction between two persons, not just how a person reacts. Yet a previous study found dogs will choose boxes that people reacted to happily, but not boxes people reacted to with a disgusted face.

In response to the other woman, he gave the corns back and called them _ (in Spanish;the study was conducted in Argentina). After these interactions, the man left and an assistant holding the dog let the dog go. While many dogs didn't approach either woman, the dogs that did have a preference tended to prefer the woman with the yummier  food. Other studies of dogs' people-watching ability have found dogs are able to tell the difference between happy and sad faces in their owners. They prefer people who give others food when asked over people who don't give others food. And in one study, dogs turned toward crying people more often than toward talking people. So how much do dogs really understand about the humans around them? That's not totally settled yet. In a strange twist to the Argentine study above, when the researchers tried an experiment in which they put two plates of corns on a table and had a man react to each plate, dogs didn't preferentially approach the tastier plate afterward. You could say dogs watch for the interaction between two persons, not just how a person reacts. Yet a previous study found dogs will choose boxes that people reacted to happily, but not boxes people reacted to with a disgusted face. Well, either way, you can be sure Fluffs is keeping an eye on you, to the best of her ability. The study was published in the journal PLOS One.

{"answer": 0, "choices": ["How Competition Impacts Gas Prices", "Gas Prices Go Up or Down", "Competition---a Very Complex Word", "We Can't Stress Enough the Need for Competition"], "question": "Competition. It's a simple word, yet a very complex word that covers many angles when it comes to how gasoline prices are determined. It seems so easy to explain, but don't let that trick you--it's incredibly difficult to explain and adequately understand. Say you're on a Sunday afternoon drive, and notice a gas station near you charging $3.50. Down the road a few miles, that price could easily be 10 or more cents higher or lower. The question is \"how\" or \"why\" is that? Think of it this way. Are you more likely to get a better deal on a car if there are two similar car dealers next to each other? Perhaps, because the dealers are too close. Say there is a third similar car dealer miles away. Is he going to be at the same level of competition and sell his cars for the same price as the two dealers next to each other? Likely not. He may charge more or less. Maybe people don't know there are two other dealers down the road. Maybe the dealer is almost outside of the city and the land value isn't as high, so his taxes aren't as high. These situations do take place at gas stations. And more factors can impact what a station will charge. Timing can greatly impact what price a station charges as well! Many motorists fail to realize that the price a station pays for gasoline changes daily. If one station gets lucky and buys gas on Monday and the cost goes up Tuesday, the station that bought on Monday doesn't necessarily have to raise prices like the station that bought on Tuesday. Maybe the station that got caught buying for a higher price on Tuesday will pass that higher cost on by raising its gas price. Perhaps the difference is what brand the station is---branded stations usually pay a slightly higher cost for their gasoline. In return for paying a higher cost, those stations are guaranteed first supply in case of emergency situations. Independent stations don't pay as much, but aren't guaranteed supply. While competition sounds easy to understand, there are always a large number of factors that could influence what one station charges. Keep in mind how many variables there are next time you fill up.

If one station gets lucky and buys gas on Monday and the cost goes up Tuesday, the station that bought on Monday doesn't necessarily have to raise prices like the station that bought on Tuesday. Maybe the station that got caught buying for a higher price on Tuesday will pass that higher cost on by raising its gas price. Perhaps the difference is what brand the station is---branded stations usually pay a slightly higher cost for their gasoline. In return for paying a higher cost, those stations are guaranteed first supply in case of emergency situations. Independent stations don't pay as much, but aren't guaranteed supply. While competition sounds easy to understand, there are always a large number of factors that could influence what one station charges. Keep in mind how many variables there are next time you fill up.

Man, even five hundred years ago, was shorter than he is today. Now, on average, men are about three inches taller, so we may assume   that man will continue to grow taller. Again, as time goes on, we shall have to use our brains more and more. This is likely to bring about a physical change to the head, in particular, the forehead will grow larger.

An average American kid consumes  more than 20 teaspoons of sugar per day, and adults eat 50% more sugar today than they did in the 1970s. We all know that too much sugar isn't good for us. Researchers at the University of Utah used mice to make a study to prove the _ effects of eating more sugar. They found it could influence people's health seriously. During the 58-week-long study, mice were fed a diet containing 25% more sugar. This percentage is equal to a healthy human diet along with three cans of soda daily. The team found that these mice were twice as likely to die as mice without eating so much sugar. Though the mice did not show signs of obesity or high blood pressure, male mice produced 25% fewer offspring  than the other mice. The reason why mice were chosen for research by scientists is not far to seek. \"Mice have the genetic  structure similar to humans'. Most substances  that are harmful to mice are also harmful to people; it's likely that those important physical problems that cause the rising death rate among mice can also influence people,\" says the study author James Ruff of the University of Utah. Findings from this study reveal negative effects that are not as detectable as weight gain or heart problems. Sugar can contribute to long-term changes in the body that can affect development and even shorten lives. Different types of sugar have different effects on the human body. Some of the sugar we consume comes from foods we might expect--candy, soda, and cookies. But much of the sugar that we eat is hidden. Food companies add large amounts of sugar to items we may not classify as sweets. To help cut down extra sugar consumption, nutrition experts suggest looking at the ingredients on food packages. Cutting sugar out of the American diet altogether may be difficult, but making every effort to control our nation's desire for sugar will avoid a sweeter future. Why did the scientists choose mice to do the study?", "subject": ""}

If prying into  other's lives were an Olympic sport, then Team GB would surely take the gold medal. And when the British can't watch the lives of real people, they have another source of entertainment to fall back on--the soap opera. British soap operas are very different to US TV dramas. For one, they are normally longer running. The two most popular, Coronation Street and East-enders, have been running for 48 and 24 years respectively. Both are broadcast several times a week, so remarkably there have been more than 7,000 _ of Coronation Street. The most obvious difference is that, unlike US dramas, the British soap operas focus on the real world. There is little glamour  , the stars are rarely rich, and they normally have boring jobs. Perhaps the appeal is that the lives of the characters often mirror the lives of the audience--but with some drama added. This means the viewer can relate to the characters and feel the pain and happiness they go through on the show. Because these soap operas last for decades, the cast is ever changing. The shows rarely focus on one or two main characters. Like the real world, people come and go all the time. However, there are exceptions. Coronation Street's William Roach, 76, has played the role of Ken Barlow since the very first episode of the show in 1960, and he is still a regular. The choice of which soap opera you follow is often cultural: People from the north of British tend to watch Coronation Street as it is set in Manchester.

But Shargorodsky said that might not be true. \"We know from before that it is difficult to ask this age group about noise exposure - _ \" Few people would call it noise when they listen to music on their MP3 player, for example. \"There is a difference between what we think is loud and what is harmful to the ear,\" said Grimes. Although it's not clear that the MP3 players cause teenagers' hearing loss, Grimes said it was still a good idea to turn down the sound and take short breaks from listening.

The findings, the first to show differences in very young babies, suggest there is a biological basis to their preferences. Psychologists Dr Brenda Todd from City University London carried out an experiment involving 90 infants aged nine months to 36 months. The babies were allowed to choose from seven toys. Some were stereotypically boys' toys - a car, a digger, a ball and a blue teddy.  The rest were girls' toys: a pink teddy, a doll and a cooking set. They were placed a meter away from the toys, and could pick whichever toy they liked. Their choice and the amount of time they spent playing with each toy were recorded. Of the youngest children (nine to 14 months), girls spent significantly longer playing with the doll than boys, and boys spent much more time with the car and ball than the girls did. Among the two-and three-year-olds, girls spent 50 percent of the time playing with the doll while only two boys briefly touched it. The boys spent almost 90 percent of their time playing with cars, which the girls barely touched. There was no link between the parents' view on which toys were more appropriate for boys or girls, and the children's choice. Dr Brenda Todd said: \"Children of this age are already exposed to much socialization. Boys may be given 'toys that go' while girls get toys they can care for, which may help shape their preference.

One woman named Sylvia Banda had a dream to become a successful businesswoman and build her own brand  . So, after finishing high school, Banda went to college to learn how to start a food company. She studied hard and spent her free time coming up with ways to make money, including making food and selling it to friends. In 1987, when Banda was 24 years old, she decided to start her own restaurant. She borrowed a room and used food, and pans from her own kitchen. The first day, her restaurant did not have any chairs or tables, but she was able to sell all of the food that she had made. After counting the money, she was surprised that she had made more in one day than most people make in one month. From that small restaurant, Banda built a large company called the Sylva Group. It now has hundreds of people working for it and is worth over a million dollars. Besides restaurants, the company has now built hotels and a college in Zambia, and it also sells many kinds of packaged   foods. After reaching her goal   of starting her own business and becoming rich, Banda decided to work to improve the lives of other Zambians. She does this in a number of ways.

It will take a great engineering effort to protect these cities---an effort that may be beyond economies that have been brought to their knees. None of this means we should fear, and stop trying to forbid emissions. But together with these efforts, we need to start acting now and we must stop building in danger zones. Billions of dollars are being spent on constructing homes, offices and roads in _ coastal areas. For instance, the skyscrapers of Shanghai are being built on land that is merely 4 meters above sea level on average, and they are sinking under the weight of the buildings. Therefore, planning for new coastal developments is to go against reality. If we want to build a lasting heritage for our children, we should do so on the plentiful land that is in no danger from the sea. It is one of the effective ways to slow down climate change, and we should be acting on it now. What's the main purpose of this passage?", "subject": ""}

She was the middle of three sisters, between Kerry, who is 25, and Jennifer, who was 18.

Michigan State University researcher Jianguo \"Jack\" Liu and his assistant Eunice Yu said the increasing number of divorces leads to more households with fewer people and greater consumption of water and energy. They said housing units require space, construction materials and fuel to heat and cool, regardless of the number of inhabitants. For example, in the United States in 2005, divorced households consumed an extra 73 billion kilowatt hours of electricity and 627 billion gallons of water. An additional 38 million extra rooms required heating and lighting that same year due to divorced households. That costs $6.9 billion in extra utility costs per year, Liu said, plus an added $ 3.6 billion for water, in addition to other costs such as land use. \"A married household actually uses resources more efficiently than a divorced household,\" Liu said. He said that in cohabitating  household, people will watch the same television, share the air conditioning and heat and use the same refrigerator. All things use energy at a regularly stable rate, regardless of the number of users. Liu said he was not condemning divorce, \"Some people really need to get divorced.\" He said cohabitation--whether by a family or friends--was simply a more environmentally friendly option. Additonally, the researchers noted that trends other than divorce are also changing family living structures, such as the end of multiple generations of a family sharing a home and people remaining single longer. \"People's first reaction to this research is surprise, and then it seems simple.\" Liu said in a press release. \"But a lot of things become simple after research is done. Our challenges were to connect the dots and quantify  their relationships. People have been talking about how to protect the environment and fight against climate change, but divorce is a factor that people don't notice and it needs to be considered\".

It is a little like Christmas in the United States, but there are some differences between the two festivals. Both the major Chinese and the major Western holidays come during the cold season, and special food is expected. In western countries, cookies and cakes begin just after Thanksgiving in November and show up everywhere. Turkey, potatoes and other food come later. Similar thing happens in China. Entering lunar December, most families will make shopping plans for _ and food is certainly one of the most important things to be considered. At the end of the month, both parents in each family will be very busy---the father is busy buying food while the mother is busy cooking. A deeper similarity   is tradition. Christmas, as the letters \"Christ\" suggests, began as a holiday to celebrate the birthday of Jesus Christ. Many people pray   on this day. In China, people living in cities or towns, though they don't plan to sow seeds  this month, still celebrate on the big day for farmers. Followers of both holidays are also different from each other. While Chinese people travel to the homes of elder relatives, Americans usually call or send cards. Westerners prefer Christmas carols to fireworks. In Christmas, many family gifts come together instead of one by one, since adults may have only one day free to celebrate. But the most curious difference is about students. Chinese students going home for Spring Festival sometimes report that they get bored by the end of vacation, yet American students seldom get bored around Christmas and western New Year. Not everyone enjoys classic holiday traditions. Students in western countries may get upset, as too much homework, travel or bad family relations may destroy the short holiday season. In China, more and more college students choose to travel or work during the winter holiday instead of going home to stay with their families. It's against the tradition but many people accept it.

Recent research found that 40 percent of U.S.shoppers have showroomed previously, with big-box retailers suffering the most.Specifically, the study shows that Best Buy, Walmart and Target are the most likely brick-and-mortar stores to have shoppers test out a product in-store and then purchase it online later, while Amazon is benefiting most from the practice, with nearly 60 percent of shoppers using the online retail giant  most often to make their showrooming purchases. Smartphones have pushed showrooming into the front.Shoppers no longer have to wait until they get home to see if they can find a cheaper price for the products they're considering buying.With smartphones, consumers can now compare virtual prices, at both other brick-and-mortar stores and online ones while still inside a retail store.If they can find what they're seeking for less online, the majority will be seeking the first exit.A recent study showed that 45 percent of customers shopping at brick-and-mortar stores walk out and buy their purchase online for a discount of as little as 2.5 percent. This puts pressure on retailers to provide both an in-store experience worth staying for and an online presence that can attract shoppers who are showrooming in other businesses. To cut down on showrooming, many retailers are adopting new methods to keep shoppers in their stores.Among the steps they're taking are price-matching guarantees that allow shoppers to pay a discounted price if they find it cheaper online.This ensures that even a showrooming shopper can make the purchase in the store--regardless of whether they find the cheaper price online. Another popular method to fight against showrooming is to give shoppers the ability to buy something online and pick it up at the store.This reduces shipping costs and gets customers in the store, where they may be encouraged to make an additional purchase.

It was firmly pointed out from the beginning that the delivery date had to be less than six weeks from the original order in order to satisfy our own customers' requirements. While we understand that delays in production are occasionally unavoidable, we must point out that the major reason why the order was placed with your company was that we were assured by you of its simplicity, and that your existing stocks were sufficiently high to ensure immediate shipment. Late delivery of the goods has caused us to disappoint several of our most valued customers, and will have an unfavorable effect on future orders. The second complaint concerns the difference in colour between the watches we ordered and those delivered. It was stated clearly in the order that watches in combinations of green/purple and orange/purple only were required. However, only half the watches in the delivery received are of the colours specified. Our Hong Kong agent informed you of the importance of following our instructions exactly, since we consider there to be only a limited market in this country for watches of other color1s at the present time. Any watches that are not of the specified colours will, of course, be returned to you. We are also somewhat concerned about the rather poor quality of the goods received, since it is obvious that the watches that finally arrived have been made from not good enough materials and have been produced to a lower standard than those in the sample. We have also found that a number of the watches do not appear to be working. Whether the latter problem is due to poor production, or damage in transportation is not yet clear, but we should like to point out that we feel this matter to be entirely your fault. As a result of the above problems, therefore, we feel that the most suitable course of action is to return to you unpaid any of the goods considered unsatisfactory.

The second complaint concerns the difference in colour between the watches we ordered and those delivered. It was stated clearly in the order that watches in combinations of green/purple and orange/purple only were required. However, only half the watches in the delivery received are of the colours specified. Our Hong Kong agent informed you of the importance of following our instructions exactly, since we consider there to be only a limited market in this country for watches of other color1s at the present time. Any watches that are not of the specified colours will, of course, be returned to you. We are also somewhat concerned about the rather poor quality of the goods received, since it is obvious that the watches that finally arrived have been made from not good enough materials and have been produced to a lower standard than those in the sample. We have also found that a number of the watches do not appear to be working. Whether the latter problem is due to poor production, or damage in transportation is not yet clear, but we should like to point out that we feel this matter to be entirely your fault. As a result of the above problems, therefore, we feel that the most suitable course of action is to return to you unpaid any of the goods considered unsatisfactory. We shall also, of course, be forced to reconsider whether any further orders should be placed with your company. We look forward to your early reply.

{"answer": 2, "choices": ["1.", "2.", "3.", "4."], "question": "Like every language, American English is full of special expressions, phrases that come from the day-to-day life of the people and develop in their own way. Our expression today is \"to face the music\". When someone says, \"Well, I guess I'll have to face the music,\" it does not mean he's planning to go to the concert. It is something far less pleasant, like being called in by your boss to explain why you did this and did that, and why you didn't do this or that. Awful music indeed, but it has to be faced. At sometime or another, every one of us has to face the music, especially as children. We can all remember father's angry voice, \"I want to talk to you.\" and only because we did not obey him. What an unpleasant business it was! The phrase \"to face the music\" is familiar to every American, young and old. It is at least 100 years old. And where did this expression come from? The first explanation comes from the American novelist, James Fenimore Looper. He said, in 1851, that the expression was first used by actors while waiting to go on the stage. When they got their cue  to go on, they often said, \"Well, it's time to face the music.\" And that was exactly what they did--facing the orchestra  which was just below them. And an actor might be frightened or nervous as he moved on to the stage in front of an audience that might be friendly or perhaps _ , especially if he forgot his lines. But he had to go out. If he did not, there would be no play. So the expression \"to face the music\" came to mean \"having to go through something, no matter how unpleasant the experience might be, because you knew you had no choice.\" Other explanations about the expression go back to the army. When the men faced an inspection  by their leader, the soldiers would be worried about how well they looked. Was their equipment clean, shiny enough to pass the inspection? Still the men had to go out and face the music of the band as well as the inspection. What else could they do? Another army explanation is more closely linked to the idea of facing the results and accepting the responsibility for something that should not have been done. For example, when a man is forced out of the army because he did something terrible, he is dishonored. The band does not play. Only the drums tap a sad, slow beat. The soldier is forced to leave, facing such music as it is and facing the back of his horse. How many ways does the phrase \"to face the music\" comes from?", "subject": ""}

Estonia. The Ministry of the environment gave them some support. Many other companies joined in the group. Famous actors and singers also took part. Even the President of Estonia joined in. They sent information about Let's Do It! Estonia throughout the country. Technology experts developed a special computer program. Team members went into the forests to find where the rubbish was. They used their mobile phones to mark every place where they found rubbish and send the information to the computer program. Then, the marked rubbish places appeared on the map. Anyone could go on the Internet and see the map. The team found a surprising result. There were over 10,000 tons of waste in the forests of Estonia. When people saw how much waste was around their own homes, they were shocked. Thousands of people began to help. The team chose May 3, 2008 as the day to clean up the rubbish.

Fast food advertisements significantly affect teens' eating habits, leading to consequences such as obesity. TV Advertising The television is the largest source of food ads to teens. It is worth noting that TV watching may not be the chief cause of obesity, but rather the fast food commercials. This implies that fast food commercials greatly influence teens' eating habits, since food is the most advertised item on television. Online Advertising The Internet has become part of a teen's daily life. Fast food manufacturers have taken advantage of this to target teenagers with food commercials. McDonald's corporation has created websites such as 365Black.com. which target minority groups. MeEncanta. com is a McDonald's website that targets Latino youth, who are four and a half times more likely than other youth to visit the site. Eating Habits There is a strong connection between teens' eating habits and fast food commercials. In a study of more than 12,000 teenagers to inquire into the effects of fast food advertising on teenagers, teens who spent more than two hours watching commercial TV were likely to allow themselves to eat more unhealthy foods like fast foods, sugary drinks and snacks than those who did not. Obesity Teens who view fast food ads are at a higher risk of becoming overweight than those who do not, reports the American Academy of Pediatrics.

Probably the most important thing kids learn is how to have peer relationships. As a parent, you can't do this, because you and your child aren't equals. For example, when you're sitting on your family room floor and your very young child asks you to pass him the blocks, you probably hand them right over. If your child is sitting with a peer and asks the same thing, though, he might not get what he wants. To succeed, your child will need to learn strategies for getting what he wants. For example, he might simply yank   the toy out of his friend's hand. If he does that, he may learn that it's not the best way of getting what he wants because it leads to fighting and time-outs. The successful child will learn that he needs to negotiate a trade, to wait patiently, or to find something else equally fun to play with. Friends also provide emotional support, something that is part of the foundation of healthy adulthood. You can't be with your child on the elementary school playground or at the high school dance. Your child's friends will be the ones to _ her, to include her in games, and later, to tell her she looks great even if her lousy prom   date wanders off instead of dancing with her. Friends also help your children learn. Friends solve problems together, imitate each other, and pass on knowledge . Some experts believe that the single biggest predictor of your child's success later in life is her ability to make friends. In fact, they claim it's even more important than IQ and grades. This doesn't mean that the kids who are most popular in school do the best later on in life. What matters is not the number of friends a child has but rather the quality of the relationships. This is good news for those of us who hate to think that popularity really is the Holy Grail of childhood and adolescence. While it's true that popularity has many advantages, and that many popular kids really are nice people--and not just the best dressed or best looking--it's better to have a few good friends than to have the admiration of the masses.

The UK promises to reduce its carbon emissions  by 80 percent by 2050, part of which will be achieved by all new homes being zero carbon by 2016. But this report shows that sustainable building design on its own--though extremely important--is not enough to achieve such reductions: the behavior of the people using the building has to change too. The study suggests that the ways that people use and live in their homes have been largely ignored by existing efforts to improve energy efficiency, _ instead focus on architectural and technological developments. \"Technology is going to assist but it is not going to do everything,\"explains Katy Janda, a UKERC senior researcher, \"consumption patterns of building users can defeat the most careful design.\" In other words, old habits die hard, even in the best designed eco home.

Take bladderworts, a kind of such plant, for example. They appear so small and grow in a quiet pond. \"But these are the fastest known killers of the plant kingdom, able to capture a small insect in 1/50 of a second using a trap door!\" Once the trap door closes on the victim, the enzymes similar to those in the human stomach slowly digest the insert. When dinner is over, the plant opens the trap door and is ready to trap again. Meat-eating plants grow mostly in wet areas with soil that doesn't offer much food nutrition. In such conditions, these amazing plants have developed insect traps to get their nutritional needs over thousands of years. North America has more such plants than any other continents. Generally speaking, the traps may have attractive appearance to fool the eye, like pitcher plants, which get their name because they look like beautiful pitchers full of nectar .

At the start of the year, the pupils were each given a _ , ranging from \"excellent prospect\" to \"unlikely to do well\". These were totally untrue ratings and did not reflect how well the pupils had previously performed. However, these ratings were given to the teachers. At the end of the year, the experimenters compared the pupils' performance with the ratings. Despite their real abilities, there was an astonishingly high connection between performance and ratings. It seems that people perform as well as we expect them to. The Self-fulfilling Effect is also known as the Pygmalion Effect. This comes from an old Greek story. The story was also the basis of George Bernard Shaw's play \"Pygmalion\", later turned into the musical \"My Fair Lady\". In Shaw's play, Professor Henry Higgins claims he can turn a Cockney flower girl, Eliza Doolittle into a duchess. But, as Eliza herself points out to Higgins' friend Pickering, it isn't what she learns or does that determines whether she will become a duchess, but how she's treated. The implication   of the Pygmalion Effect for leaders and managers is massive. It means that the performance of your team depends less on them than it does on you. The performance you get from people is no more or less than what you expect, which means you must always expect the best. As Goethe said, \"Treat a man as he is and he will remain as he is. Treat a man as he can and should be and he will become as he can and should be.\" What's the passage mainly about?", "subject": ""}

{"answer": 3, "choices": ["Hip-hop and rap.", "Breaking dance.", "Rock.", "Jazz."], "question": "Western teens share their top tunes Have you ever wondered what kind of music kids across the Pacific Ocean are listening to? Are they crazy about Britney Spears? Do they love the Backstreet Boys? Or do they dance to Eminem? Well, nearly 6,000 teens have taken part in a Teens & Music study, conducted by USA Weekend Magazine last autumn. And the results show what type of music is hot and what is not. It comes as no surprise that hip-hop   and rap   are the most popular types of music among American teenagers. They began in the mid-1970s, with young black kids in New York, taking music onto the streets. Hip-hop and rap are well-known for the breakdancing   that goes with them. The word \"rap\" comes from a 1960s slang   word for conversation. It is a rapid, slangy rhyme   that is spoken rather than sung. Eminem is among the most popular rappers ever to hit the US. His first album \"The Marshall Mathers LP\" topped the American music chart   in May 2000. Although about a third of teens in the US showed their support for him, almost as many said that his music was so offensive that they couldn't listen to it. Compared with Eminem, actor-rapper Will Smith is more of a star for the kids. He was awarded the Wannabe Award, on April 12 at Nickelodeon's 16th Annual Kids' Choice Awards. It is an award given to a celebrity whom kids most want to be. Pop music, such as Brittney Spears and the Backstreet Boys has always suited the tastes of the general public. It continues to enjoy support among teens and is second most popular after rap. Third is rock -- music with exciting dance beats   and simple lyrics that speak loudly of social problems. The melodies   are led by electric guitars. Rock became popular in the US in the early 1950s. American singer Elvis Presley and British group the Beatles became world-famous rock artists.

Are they crazy about Britney Spears? Do they love the Backstreet Boys? Or do they dance to Eminem? Well, nearly 6,000 teens have taken part in a Teens & Music study, conducted by USA Weekend Magazine last autumn. And the results show what type of music is hot and what is not. It comes as no surprise that hip-hop   and rap   are the most popular types of music among American teenagers. They began in the mid-1970s, with young black kids in New York, taking music onto the streets. Hip-hop and rap are well-known for the breakdancing   that goes with them. The word \"rap\" comes from a 1960s slang   word for conversation. It is a rapid, slangy rhyme   that is spoken rather than sung. Eminem is among the most popular rappers ever to hit the US. His first album \"The Marshall Mathers LP\" topped the American music chart   in May 2000. Although about a third of teens in the US showed their support for him, almost as many said that his music was so offensive that they couldn't listen to it. Compared with Eminem, actor-rapper Will Smith is more of a star for the kids. He was awarded the Wannabe Award, on April 12 at Nickelodeon's 16th Annual Kids' Choice Awards. It is an award given to a celebrity whom kids most want to be. Pop music, such as Brittney Spears and the Backstreet Boys has always suited the tastes of the general public. It continues to enjoy support among teens and is second most popular after rap. Third is rock -- music with exciting dance beats   and simple lyrics that speak loudly of social problems. The melodies   are led by electric guitars. Rock became popular in the US in the early 1950s. American singer Elvis Presley and British group the Beatles became world-famous rock artists. The study also showed that jazz is least loved by American teens. It developed in the latter part of the 19th century from a mixture of African work songs and hymns  .

{"answer": 1, "choices": ["Optimistic adults.", "Middle-aged adults.", "Adults in poor health.", "Adults of lower income."], "question": "A German study suggests that people who were too optimistic about their future actually faced greater risk of disability or death within 10 years than those pessimists who expected their future to be worse. The paper, published this March in Psychology and Aging, examined health and welfare surveys from roughly 40,000 Germans between ages 18 and 96. The surveys were conducted every year from 1993 to 2003. Survey respondents   were asked to estimate their present and future life satisfaction on a scale of 0 to 10, among other questions. The researchers found that young adults (age 18 to 39) routinely overestimated their future life satisfaction, while middle-aged adults (age 40 to 64) more accurately predicted how they would feel in the future. Adults of 65 and older, however, were far more likely to underestimate their future life satisfaction. Not only did they feel more satisfied than they thought they would, the older pessimists seemed to suffer a lower ratio   of disability and death for the study period. \"We observed that being too optimistic in predicting a better future than actually observed was associated with a greater risk of disability and a greater risk of death within the following decade,\" wrote Frieder R. Lang, a professor at the University of Erlangen-Nuremberg. Lang and his colleagues believed that people who were pessimistic about their future may be more careful about their actions than people who expected a rosy future. \"Seeing a dark future may encourage positive evaluations of the actual self and may contribute to taking improved precautions  ,\" the authors wrote. Surprisingly, compared with those in poor health or who had low incomes, respondents who enjoyed good health or income were associated with expecting a greater decline. Also, the researchers said that higher income was related to a greater risk of disability. The authors of the study noted that there were limitations to their conclusions. Illness, medical treatment and personal loss could also have driven health outcomes.

When the researchers recorded the locations of these bee populations, they found that many of the 67 species analyzed were moving northward from their southern limits while the northern edges of the bees' ranges are staying in place. What it results in is obvious. Bees have been paid more attention to in recent years, with populations of honeybees and bumblebees obviously declining in some parts of Europe. Previously, attention on the decline of bee populations has focused on causes including habitat loss, pesticide use and the spread of bee parasites . But the work by Kerr's team found something different. \"For every species, there is one or two species declining and others that are not moving at all,\" says Kerr. This shift has also been observed in other species, such as butterflies. But due to a new cause -- the rise of temperatures instead of total pesticide use, a change in land use or parasites, bumblebees -- unlike butterflies -- have failed to extend the northern boundaries of their ranges into the territory that is now habitable for them, so bumblebee species across Europe and North America are declining rapidly, the latest study led by Kerr's team finds. \"Our data suggest that the new factor plays a leading, or perhaps the leading, role in this trend,\" says Kerr. \"This study shows that a fourth factor is also beginning to affect it.

{"answer": 1, "choices": ["Having a car ride.", "Taking the train twice.", "Buying more than one toy.", "Touring the historic district."], "question": "When my brother and I were young, my mom would take us on Transportation Days. It goes like this: You can't take any means of transportation more than once. We would start from home, walking two blocks to the rail station. We'd take the train into the city center, then a bus, switching to the tram, then maybe a taxi. We always considered taking a horse carriage in the historic district, but we didn't like the way the horses were treated, so we never did. At the end of the day, we took the subway to our closest station, where Mom's friend was waiting to give us a ride home--our first car ride of the day. The good thing about Transportation Days is not only that Mom taught us how to get around. She was born to be multimodal  . She understood that depending on cars only was a failure of imagination and, above all, a failure of confidence--the product of a childhood not spent exploring subway tunnels. Once you learn the route map and step with certainty over the gap between the train and the platform, nothing is frightening anymore. New cities are just light-rail lines to be explored. And your personal car, if you have one, becomes just one more tool in the toolbox--and often an inadequate one, limiting both your mobility and your wallet. On Transportation Days, we might stop for lunch on Chestnut Street or buy a new book or toy, but the transportation was the point. First, it was exciting enough to watch the world speed by from the train window. As I got older, my mom helped me unlock the mysteries that would otherwise have paralyzed my first attempts to do it myself: How do I know where to get off? How do I know how much it costs? How do I know when I need tickets, and where to get them? What track, what line, which direction, where's the stop, and will I get wet when we go under the river? I'm writing this right now on an airplane, a means we didn't try on our Transportation Days and, we now know, the dirtiest and most polluting of them all. My flight routed me through Philadelphia. My multimodal mom met me for dinner in the airport. She took a train to meet me. Which was forbidden by Mom on Transportation Days?", "subject": ""}

{"answer": 1, "choices": ["a hotel", "Berbers' real home", "Luke Skywalker's childhood home", "the shooting location of \"Attack of the Clones\""], "question": "Plenty of people dream of traveling to other planets. But \"Star Wars\" fans can actually visit locations where many of the films' most famous scenes were shot. Here are some of the places where \"Star Wars\" comes to life. Hotel Sidi Driss, Matmata, Tunisia Perhaps the most famous \"Star Wars\" landmark in the world, this is where the interiors of Luke Skywalker's childhood home on planet Tatooine were filmed. Centuries ago, Berbers built the underground structure as a real home. Eventually it became a hotel, which George Lucas used to film the first \"Star Wars\" film. The set decorations came down when the crew left, but were rebuilt in 2000 for \"Attack of the Clones.\" Since then, they've remained, so guests can eat at the table where young master Luke did. La Grande Dune, outside Nefta, Tunisia The igloo  outside of Luke's house was filmed about 300 kilometers away on the dried-up salt lake of Chott El Jerid. The igloo is still there, reachable with a decent car at the GPS coordinates 33\"50'34. 42\"N, 7\"46'44.48\"E. The surrounding hotels are man-made, to create the illusion  that the underground house is next to it. The igloo from the 1977 movie was taken apart, but again rebuilt for \"Attack of the Clones,\" and later restored by a fan. Nearby is La Grande Dune, site of the Dune Sea. About 30 minutes from the igloo is the set of Mos Espa, the spaceport town where Anakin was discovered as a young slave. Redwood National and State parks, California  _ , the forest moon home of the furry Ewoks, was filmed among California's giant redwoods. Most of the well-known scenes were shot on private land owned by a lumber company. Since the cast and crew worked on \"Return of the Jedi\" in 1982, heavy logging has left most of the landscape unrecognizable. But driving through the parks still gives a feel for the set, especially along the Avenue of the Giants highway. In Grizzly Creek Redwoods State Park and the Humboldt Redwoods State Park, plates were filmed for some chase scenes. Hotel Sidi Driss was originally   _   centuries ago.", "subject": ""}
