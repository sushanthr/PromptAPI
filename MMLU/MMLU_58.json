But a mathematician in Maryland does, and he has come up with mathematical tools to help police find criminals. People who solve crimes look for patterns that might reveal  the identity of the criminal. It's long been believed, for example, that criminals will break the law closer to where they live, simply because it's easier to get around in their own neighborhood. If police see a pattern of robberies in a certain area, they may look for a suspect  who lives near the crime scenes. So, the farther away from the area a crime takes place, the less likely it is that the same criminal did it. But Mike O'Leary, a mathematician at Towson University in Maryland, says that this kind of approach may be too simple. He says that police may get better clues to the location of a criminal's home base by combining these patterns with a city's layout  and historical crime records. The records of past crimes contain geographical information and can reveal easy targets -- that is, the kind of stores that might be less difficult to rob. Because these stores are along roads, the locations of past crimes contain information about where major streets and intersections are. O'Leary is writing a new computer program that will quickly provide this kind of information for a given city. His program also includes information about the people who live in the city, and information about how a criminal's patterns change with age.

Most grocery stores play the music non-stop ,Christmas song after Christmas song, disgusting the customers who don't like that kind of music. You can walk through stores and attempt turning off the music, but sometimes it's impossible to do so. On the other hand, almost everyone has witnessed random persons walking along happily and either singing or whistling to the tune of the song that's played throughout the store.

Of course, some animals have powers just as amazing, Birds can fly thousands miles by observing positions of the stars in the sky in relation to the time of day and year. In Nature's talent show, humans are a species of animal that have developed their own special act.

Our facial expressions convey our emotions, such as anger, or joy, or disappointment. The way we hold our heads can indicate to others whether we are happy or sad.

Your humor must be relevant to the audience and should help to show them that you are one of them or that you understand their situation and are in sympathy with their point of view.

It is normal and can even be helpful to experience fear sometimes. In dangerous situations, fear can keep our bodies alert   so that we can act quickly to protect ourselves. But for some people, fear develops into a \"phobia\", which is a strong and unreasonable fear of something. For example, the majority of us feel a little scared when looking down from a tall building. But people with height phobia may have trouble breathing, feel dizzy or turn down a great job just because the company is on the 20th floor. Phobias can prevent you from living a normal life. \"People with spider phobia would stay out of their home or dormitory room for days if they thought a spider was present,\" Katherina Hauner, a researcher at Northwestern University, US, told ABC news. This is why scientists have been trying to find a cure for this disease. Since fear comes from experience --- from what we are told, what we see others experience and what happens to us --- some scientists think if they can \"rewrite\" these unpleasant memories, they might be able to help people overcome their phobias. In a study by Hauner and other scientists, participants with spider phobia were asked to first touch a spider with a paintbrush. Seeing that it was not actually dangerous, they then tried touching it while wearing a glove. Finally, they could hold it with their hands. Certain medicine has also been found to be helpful. Back in 2010, researchers at the University of Hiroshima, Japan, injected   a special medicine into a fish --- who was afraid of light --- to turn off the fear center in its brain. From then on, the fish no longer feared light. While the search for solutions to phobias is making great progress, it's an open question whether getting rid of fear is good.

Through a combination of user controls, new technologies and changing standards of social behavior, Facebook is freeing us from these limitations, making friendships more accessible, pleasant and diverse than ever before. First, Facebook allows you to find and rediscover friends and then reminds you of these connections, so that you are less likely to fall out of touch with the long-lost school friend, or the family member in a different country. 'Second, Facebook creates an environment that allows you to interact easily with others : you can share your photos,videos,links and thoughts with your friends, and respond to what they share in turn. Third, Facebook's unique technical system helps you to discover your friends,most valuable stories. These technologies allow people to keep and enrich friendships that they might otherwise have been unable to keep. The effect of this is very great. A recent study by Keith Hampton for the Pew Internet and American Life Project discovered that users of social networking websites have larger, more diverse social circles, online and offline. This outcome comes at no cost to one's closest relationships, which are kept in person and over the phone. Instead, the hour that the average user spends each day socializing on Facebook comes at the expense of less social activities, such as the three or so hours a day the average person spends watching television. Time may limit our ability to keep social ties, but our desire for social communication is limitless.

In one investigation, they analyzed data on 3610 people, aged 24 to 96. They found that the higher their level of social interaction  , the better their cognitive   functioning.  Social interaction includes getting together or having phone chats with relatives, freinds and neighbors. In another experiment, the researchers conducted lab tests on 76 college students, aged 18 to 21, to evaluate how social interactions and intellectual exercises affected the results of memory and mental performance tests. The students were divided into three groups: the social interaction group had a discussion of a social issue for 10 minutes before taking the tests; the intellectual activities group completed three tasks (including a reading comprehension exercise and a crossword puzzle) before the tests; and a control group   watched a 10-minute clip   of the Seinfeld television show. \"We found that short-term social interaction lasting for just 10 minutes improved participants' intellectual performance as much as engaging in so-called 'intellectual' activities for the same amount of time,\" Ybarra said.

My mother , who is very traditional  , says that our plans are unreasonable. She thinks that we should just spend two weeks on a holiday in the Caribbean . In her days , and in the old country , young couples didn't start business together. Instead the man went out to work , and the wife stayed home to raise a family.       Both Samantha and I want children in the future , and together we plan to raise them . Needless to say, our plans and my mother's views don't agree . I suppose it's hard for my mother and father to understand our point of view. They are used to another way of setting up a marriage and a life.       Another thing that worries my parents is the fact that Samantha and I are going to be spending seven days a week on our business until it is running smoothly.

Taught at home by a governess and tutors, as a child Agatha Christie never attended school. She became skillful at creating games to keep herself occupied at a very young age. A _ l child, unable to adequately express her feelings, she first turned to music as a means of expression and, later in life, to writing. In 1914, at the age of 24, she married Archie Christie, a World War I fighter pilot. While he was off at war, she worked as a nurse. It was while working in a hospital during the war that Christie first came up with the idea of writing a detective novel. Although it was completed in a year, it wasn't published until 1920, five years later. \"The mysterious Affair at Styles\" gave the world the unique Hercule Poirot, a retired Belgian police officer who was to become one of the most enduring characters in all of fiction. With his waxed moustache and his \"little grey cell,\" he was \"meticulous (careful to do things correctly), a tidy little man, always neat, orderly and a bit absurd.\" Christie wrote more than 30 novels featuring Poirot. Among the most popular were\" The Murder of Roger Ackroyd\"(1926), \"Murder on the Orient Expredd\"(1934), and \"Death on the Nile\" (1937).

{"answer": 3, "choices": ["Social problem", "The problem of the pension system", "More pressure on the family", "Unemployment"], "question": "\"Hey, little boy, will you support me when I'm getting old?\" Wang Wenshan, 35, asked his newborn baby as he picked him up at home. The Chinese tradition of raising sons to support parents in their old age has been weakened by the rapidly growing economy and improving standard of living. As is the case with more and more developed countries, China faces an aging society. People are living longer and having fewer children. Therefore, many Chinese families are falling into a 4-2-1 family pattern: a couple raises one child and supports four elderly parents. But few realize that a problem is likely to happen ahead. The aging of the population is a trend that now affects a growing number of countries. Not long ago, the Information Office of the State Council, China's cabinet, issued a white paper on measures China is taking to help its elderly population. The paper said China's population entered the aging period at the end of the 20thcentury and the proportion of people aged 60 and above accounted for over 10 percent of the entire population. By the end of 2005, China had nearly 144 million people over 60, accounting for 11 percent of population, according to the white paper. An expanding aged population _ means that many issues must be settled, as the problem concerns every aspect of society. It puts more pressure on each family, causing disturbing economic consequences and serious social problems. It also challenges the labor force supply and the pension system. \"I used to think that it's not an issue for me to provide for the aged,\" said Wang, whose parents and parents-in-law all enjoy pensions and medical insurance. But last year Wang's father suffered a serious illness and afterward Wang began to feel the pressure on his shoulders. After his father recovered, Wang opened bank accounts for each parent and deposited some money into the account every month to prepare for future uncertainties. In addition, he has to save money every month to provide for his son's future education. \"I'm now breaking my back working to support my family: saving pensions for the parents, my son's education funds, and living costs.\" Wang also bought some commercial old-age insurance for himself. \"We have to take precautions before it is too late, and many of my colleagues share the same view,\" he said.

That's what researchers from the University of Western Australia found in a new study published in the journal Child Development. \"Parents who frequently put themselves in someone else's shoes in conversations with their children make it more likely their children will be able to do the same,\" said lead author Brad Farrant. Researchers of the UWA's Telethon Institute for Child Health Research looked at the influence of how parents interact with their children to learn more about how people develop the ability to take another's perspective. The two-year study involved more than 120 Australian children aged between four and six, including children with typically developing language and others delayed in language acquisition . The children completed tasks which were designed to assess their language skills, ability to infer others' beliefs and use these to predict others' behavior, and their ability to shift flexibly between different perspectives. Among children with typically developing language, the researchers found that mothers who talked more often and in greater detail about people's thoughts and feelings -- commenting on how another person might react to a particular situation as well as their own feelings about the topic -- had children with better language skills and better perspective-taking skills. Children with delayed language acquisition were also delayed in their development of perspective-taking skills.

Hell   is where the police are German, the cooks are English, the mechanics are French, the lovers are Swiss, and everything is organized by the Italians.\" Obviously the national stereotypes   in this old joke are generalizations  , but such stereotypes are often said to \"exist for a reason\". Is there actually a sliver   of truth in them? Not likely, an international research team now says. \"National and cultural stereotypes do play an important role in how people see themselves and others, and being aware that these are not dependable is a useful thing,\" said study author Robert McCrae of the National Institute on Aging. \"These are in fact unfounded stereotypes. They don't come from looking around you,\" McCrae said. If national stereotypes aren't rooted in real experiences, then where do they come from?

Markets and queues--paying and waiting--are two different ways of allocating things, and each is appropriate to different activities. The morals of the queue, \"First come, first served, have an egalitarian   appeal. They tell us to ignore privilege, power, and deep pockets. The principle seems right on playgrounds and at bus stops. But the morals of the queue do not govern all occasions. If I put my house up for sale, I have no duty to accept the first offer that comes along, simply because it's the first. Selling my house and waiting for a bus are different activities, properly governed by different standards. Sometimes standards change, and it is unclear which principle should apply. Think of the recorded message you hear, played over and over, as you wait on hold when calling your bank: \"Your call will be answered in the order in which it was received.\" This is essential for the morals of the queue. It's as if the company is trying to ease our impatience with fairness. But don't take the recorded message too seriously. Today, some people's calls are answered faster than others. Call center technology enables companies to \"score\" incoming calls and to give faster service to those that come from rich places. You might call this telephonic queue jumping. Of course, markets and queues are not the only ways of allocating things. Some goods we distribute by merit, others by need, still others by chance. However, the tendency of markets to replace queues, and other non-market ways of allocating goods is so common in modern life that we scarcely notice it anymore.

The festival celebrates the time, over 2,000 years ago, when the Jewish people fought against an emperor who would not let them follow their own traditions and religion. When the Jewish people won back their temple in Jerusalem, they found there was only enough holy oil to keep the sacred light burning for one day. However, to their surprise, this small amount of oil kept the light burning for eight days and nights, until the people had time to make more oil. At the center of the Hanukkah celebrations is a candlestick (called a Menorah) that holds nine candles. On the first night of Hanukkah the first candle is lit, and each day this candle is used to light another candle, until on the eighth day, the last day, all the candles are lit. During Hanukkah, people go to the synagogue   to pray and to remember the miracle   of the holy oil. Hanukkah is a time for family and friends to come together. People exchange gifts and greeting cards, and children go to parties. Parents often give their children money at Hanukkah. Potato cakes, called latkes, are a traditional Hanukkah food.

These findings come from a new report in the journal Nature. David Tillman, a professor of ecology at the University of Minnesota, America, examined information from 100 countries to identify what people ate and how diet affected health. He noted a movement beginning in the 1960s. He found that as nations industrialized, population increased and earnings rose, more people began to adopt  what has been called the Western diet. The Western diet is high in sugar, fat, oil and meat. By eating these foods, people began to get fatter and sicker. David Tillman says overweight people are at greater risk for non-infectious diseases like diabetes and heart disease. Unfortunately when people become industrialized, if they adopt this Western diet, they are going to have these health problems, especially in developing countries in Asia. China is an example where the number of diabetes cases has been jumping from less than one percent to 10 percent of the population as they began to industrialize over a 20-year period. And that is happening all across the world, in Mexico, in Nigeria and so on. And, a diet bad for human beings, is also bad for the environment.

According to the study of 300 workers, 70 percent of people who use the Internet at work surf the Internet for their own reasons during office hours. Among the most popular surfing activities are searching for information about products, reading online news, playing online games and watching videos. \"Firms spend a lot of money on software to _ their workers from watching videos, using social networking sites or shopping online,\" said Coker. \"That's not always a good idea.\" However, Coker said the study looked at people who surfed the Internet in moderation , or were on the Internet for less than 20 percent of their total time in the office. \"Those who spend too much time surfing the Internet will have a lower productivity than those without.\" he said.

Global warming leads to other changes in the climate: melting ice, more evaporation , changes in geographical patterns of rainfall, heavier downpours separated by longer dry spells, more frequent heat waves, more intense hurricanes, and sea level rise. These changes could affect crop growth as drought, increased evaporation and shrinking glaciers disrupt water supply. Some crops could suffer heat stress. While there may be benefits in some regions, overall climate change is likely to have a negative impact on global food supplies. The impacts of climate change on agriculture will vary widely around the world. A global temperature rise of 1-2 degC is expected to increase food production in some regions, particularly mid-latitude areas. But in tropical regions even a small amount of warming could reduce crop yields. A temperature rise of 3 degC or more could threaten global food resources, as all regions are likely to experience negative impacts overall. Freshwater resources could also diminish, especially in tropical regions, as rain patterns change and evaporation speeds up. Some communities could lose essential melt water as glaciers disappear, while more intense rainfall and hurricanes could cause more flooding, leading to water pollution and bacterial diseases such as cholera becoming more widespread. Climate change could lead to a variety of health impacts - both positive and negative. On the negative side, scientists anticipate more cases of malnutrition, heatstroke and waterborne diseases such as cholera. Although some populations will benefit from a reduced risk of cold-related illnesses such as _ , overall a warming world is likely to have negative effects on human health. Scientists also expect damage to homes and buildings from more intense hurricanes, heavier rainfall and rising sea levels. Climate change is likely to affect infrastructure by increasing the risk of both coastal and inland flooding around the world, owing to a combination of heavier rainfall, rising sea levels and increased storm damage.

Many observers now fear that the announced cut will undermine those organizations' work. Chen Zhu, the minister of health, said officials have found a way to limit the harm. \"In the coming five years, the Chinese government will constantly increase its financial support of social organizations, particularly those that work to control and prevent HIV/AIDS.\" Chen said while addressing the 6th Experience Exchange Conference of International Cooperation Program on HIV/AIDS in China on Monday. In a recent survey of more than 200 organizations taking part in the fight against HIV/AIDS on the mainland, nearly 80 percent of them said they had received grants from the Global Fund. About 83 percent of them said they will find it difficult to continue operating without financial support from abroad, it said. Official statistics showed the Global Fund has given China $548 million in grants since 2003. Xia Jing, leader of a Beijing-based grassroots organization dedicated to controlling AIDS, said: \"We were like children fostered by foreign milk. As foreign money began to be withdrawn from China, we were faced with serious financial hardships.\" Han Mengjie, executive director of Global Fund China Programs, said the Chinese government has fully recognized the important role social organizations play in controlling diseases. \"The work done and efforts made by such organizations must be sustained for a long time to supplement the government's intervention work,\"he said, \"We have to face the truth that international money for AIDS control will gradually leave China and to prepare ourselves to deal with that.\" What implication can we get from the passage?", "subject": ""}

On board pilots Zhai Zhigang, Liu Boming and Jing Haipeng are expected to orbit the earth for three days, when one of them will float out of the cabin about 343 kilometers above the earth. When they make it, China will become the third country in the world who is able to conduct extravehicular activity (EVA) in space following the former Soviet Union and the United States.

{"answer": 2, "choices": ["In China", "In India", "In the USA", "In Japan"], "question": "Glaucoma is a major cause of blindness around the world, especially in developing countries. The World Health Organization says glaucoma is a greater public health challenge than cataracts , because the blindness caused by the latter can be cured after operations. Glaucoma is a disease that makes people around the world lose their sight, and they usually don't even know they have the disease until it has permanently destroyed at least 40 percent of their sight. The process is usually so painless and subtle , so people don't notice it. Actually, the simplest medical test can discover it. \"It is the leading cause of blindness in the United States. In Hispanics and in African-Americans, it's the second leading cause of blindness and so is the case in the Chinese and Indians.\" said Dr. Alan Robin, a specialist in treating glaucoma. \"The glaucoma we see in sub-Saharan Africa is a much more aggressive blinding disease than the glaucoma we see in Americans or even African- Americans in-the United States.\" he said.     . Dr. Eric Fleischer also sees at Medstar Washington Hospital Center. \"Pretty much anybody who has ancestors in Africa has an increased chance of developing glaucoma.\" Age is another thing that may lead to glaucoma, although people of all ages can get it. Glaucoma is a group of diseases that commonly produce pressure in the eye. An eye is sort of like a watch. And behind the face of the watch, liquid is made. It goes through your pupil and into the front of the watch between the face and the crystal.There's an area around the edge of the watch that drains the liquid. When that drain is blocked, the liquid can't leave the eye as fast as it is produced. The rising pressure within the eye damages and eventually kills the optic  nerve. The result is blindness. Fortunately, if caught early, glaucoma can be controlled. Glaucoma is not curable. But as  researchers worldwide lean more about it, they grow more hopeful that glaucoma can one day be cured or even prevented. In which country is glaucoma the biggest danger to people's sight?", "subject": ""}

Lone, 68, stepped onto the porch and saw two men in dark clothes struggling with something on the ground--right where she and her grandson had planted a flower bed the weekend before. \"Go fight somewhere else!\" she shouted, worried her plants would get damaged. At the sound of her voice, the face of a boy appeared from beneath the two men. He looked 13 or 14 or so. \"They're trying to kill me!\" the boy screamed. Lone ran toward them and, without hesitation, caught the boy's arm, pulling him out. \"Leave _ alone!\" she shouted. When the men stood up, Lone saw what looked like a sharp object in one man's hand. When she turned back toward the boy, he was moaning in pain and holding his stomach.

However, I wish to tell you how upset I have been by the way your Claims Assessor, Mr. Michael Tan, handled this claim.      When Mr. Tan first called me, he specifically told me that he believed I had been overcharged, and he would expect to pay that price for work on a double garage, rather than a single garage like mine. Mr. Tan suggested that I neither use nor recommend this contractor again. He continued to tell me it was unlikely for me to receive full payment. Never during this conversation did he mention that the reason for not receiving full payment was because of the nature of my insurance policy.      Consequently, I wrote to Mr. Lance Ashe to complain about his pricing, stating that I was very upset thinking that he could have taken advantage by overcharging a 73-year-old woman. Mr. Ashe telephoned me immediately and explained his charges in detail. He later reported back to me that Mr. Tan explained that I would not receive full payment because of the type of policy I hold, which does not cover wear and tear. This was the first time this issue had been brought to my attention, so you can imagine my surprise.     When I received Mr. Tan's letter of 2 February, this situation was explained. If this had been explained in the first place I would have accepted it and would not have questioned Mr. Ashe's charges. Instead, by telling me initially that I had been overcharged for this work, he caused a great deal of upset, not only for me but also for Mr. Ashe.

{"answer": 3, "choices": ["he was unfairly treated by his teacher", "he was disappointed with his downfall", "he was not smart enough at studies", "he got a worse mark than usual"], "question": "On October 23, 2011, David Pologruto, a high school physics teacher, wasstabbed  by his smart student Jason Haffizulla. Jason got straight A's and was determined to study medicine at Harvard, yet this was his downfall. His physics teacher gave Jason a B, a mark Jason believed wouldundermine  his entrance to Harvard. After receiving his B, Jason took a butcher knife to school and stabbed his physics teacher. How can someone as smart as Jason do something so dumb? Studies show there is little or no correlation between IQ and emotional intelligence. During my early university years, I regarded myself as an intelligent guy. I got good marks in mathematics, physics, and other subjects. I thought such skills would surely give me a bright future. After one year of study with decent marks, I began to see two major classes of students. The first category of students turned up to few lectures, partied every weekend, enjoyed a great social life, and did minimal work to pass courses. The second category of students were intelligent and hard workers who got good grades and were very focused on their studies. Surely would these intelligent and hard-working students find the great jobs before the other lazier class of students? Not so. Students are often shocked upon graduation that their qualifications are not as important as they once thought. Graduates enter the workforce only to realize that co-workers hate them and less intelligent people are the ones receiving promotions. Educational skills are useless in some industries when interpersonal skills are absent.

During the twentieth century there has been a remarkable shortening of the proportion of a woman's life spent in caring for the children. A woman marrying at the end of the nineteenth century would probably have been in her middle twenties, and would be likely to have seven or eight children, four or five of whom lived till they were five years old. By the time the youngest was fifteen, the mother would have been in her early fifties and would expect to live a further twenty years, during which health made it unusual for her to get paid work. Today women marry younger and have fewer children. Usually a woman's youngest child will be fifteen when she is forty-five years and can be expected to live another thirty-five years and is likely to take paid work until retirement at sixty. Even while she has to take care of children, her work is lightened by modern living conditions. This important change in women's life-patterns has only recently begun to have its full effect on women's economic position. Even a few years ago most girls took a full-time job after they left school. However, when they married, they usually left work at once and never returned to it. Today the school- leaving age is sixteen; many girls stay at school after that age, and though women usually marry older, more married women stay at work at least until shortly before their first child is born. Many more afterwards return to full-or-part-time work. Such changes have led to a new relationship in marriage, with the husband accepting a greater share of the duties and satisfactions of family life, and with both husband and wife sharing more equally in providing the money, and running the home, according to the abilities and interests of each of them.

During the twentieth century there has been a remarkable shortening of the proportion of a woman's life spent in caring for the children. A woman marrying at the end of the nineteenth century would probably have been in her middle twenties, and would be likely to have seven or eight children, four or five of whom lived till they were five years old. By the time the youngest was fifteen, the mother would have been in her early fifties and would expect to live a further twenty years, during which health made it unusual for her to get paid work. Today women marry younger and have fewer children. Usually a woman's youngest child will be fifteen when she is forty-five years and can be expected to live another thirty-five years and is likely to take paid work until retirement at sixty.

The Federation International de Football Association (FTFA) knows _ and is always trying to keep the rules and regulations applicable for poorer countries. For fans of the sport, it is very entertaining to watch the skills and talents of the players in professional matches. The outcome of a match can easily change in the dying moments of a game.

{"answer": 1, "choices": ["One day", "One week", "One month", "Nine months"], "question": "In a time when a dangerous number of people are overweight, many people seem to have forgotten the most important way to keep healthy and slim---exercise. And as a new study carried out on mice in the lab has shown, exercise done early in life can reward you in your adult years. A team of researchers at the University of California studied the effects of early exercise on adult physical activity, body mass and eating. They found that early-age exercise in mice has positive effects on adult levels of voluntary exercise in addition to reducing body mass. \"These results may have an effect on the importance of regular physical education in elementary and middle schools,\" said Theodore Garland, a professor of biology, who led the research project. \"If kids exercise regularly through their school years, then they may be more likely to exercise as adults, which could have far-reaching positive effects on human health and well-being.\" Although the positive effects of early-life exercise lasted for only one week, it is important to note that one week in the life of a mouse is the same as about nine months for humans. \"Our results suggest that any positive effects of early-life exercise on adult exercise will need to be kept up if they are to be long-lasting.\" His team of researchers found, too, that all mice that had access to early exercise were lighter in weight than non-exercised mice. Garland explained that, in general, exercise will stimulate appetite sooner or later. However, it is possible that certain types of exercise, done for certain periods of time or at certain light levels, might not _ appetite much, if at all, at least in some individuals. \"If we could understand what sorts of exercise these might be, then we might be able to tailor exercise recommendations in a way that would bring the benefits of exercise without increase in appetite, leading to a better chance of weight loss,\" he said.

They found that early-age exercise in mice has positive effects on adult levels of voluntary exercise in addition to reducing body mass. \"These results may have an effect on the importance of regular physical education in elementary and middle schools,\" said Theodore Garland, a professor of biology, who led the research project. \"If kids exercise regularly through their school years, then they may be more likely to exercise as adults, which could have far-reaching positive effects on human health and well-being.\" Although the positive effects of early-life exercise lasted for only one week, it is important to note that one week in the life of a mouse is the same as about nine months for humans. \"Our results suggest that any positive effects of early-life exercise on adult exercise will need to be kept up if they are to be long-lasting.\" His team of researchers found, too, that all mice that had access to early exercise were lighter in weight than non-exercised mice.

The 4D printing concept, which allows materials to \"self-assemble  \" into 3D structures, was initially proposed by Massachusetts Institute of Technology faculty member Skylar Tibbits. Tibbits and his team combined a strand   of plastic with a layer made out of \"smart\" material that could self-assemble in water. They advanced this concept by creating materials that can change into several different complicated shapes, though this kind of material remains the bottleneck of 4D technology. To many people that are just starting to get used to the idea of 3D printers, the name 4D is causing confusion because they cannot understand where this fourth \"dimension\" coming from. 4D technology shares many of the same principles of 3D printing and is essentially still about creating a new, 3D structure out of certain component; however, Tibbits states the fourth dimension at work here comes from concept of the fourth dimension of time. The difference between these 3D and 4D creations is that these new forms have the ability to transform and adapt over time. 4D printing works through self-assembly -- a system where \"disordered elements form an \"ordered\" structure via an interaction. With these 4D printed materials, these disordered materials are strands or sheets of specially designed materials. Environmental changes then stimulate  a response from them so that they form a preprogrammed shape. The idea of having adaptable technology that only relies on energy and non-human interactions raises some interesting questions about where 4D printing can be used and the practical applications in dangerous environments. This could mean improved infrastructures in extreme conditions, leading to a reduced need for workers to put themselves at risk, but the potential goes even further than that.

Undergraduates with part-time jobs are a third less likely to get a first or upper second-class degree than other students, harming their career chances. Students from the poorest backgrounds were most likely to take jobs during term because they could not depend on help from their parents. The report, commissioned   by the Department for Education and Skills, also found a clear relation between fear of debt and employment in non-graduate jobs. Students from poorer backgrounds are known to be more unwilling to be in debt than those from middle class families. The study of 8,600 people who graduated in 1999 was made by Peter Elias, of Warwick University, and Kate Purcell, from Bristol Business School. They found that twice as many first-class degrees were awarded to students who did not work during term compared with those who did. Between 35 and 38 percent who worked during term achieved a lower second, compared with about 28 percent of those who did not. Professor Elias said that the increase in school fees next year to PS3,000 would have to be monitored   carefully for its effect on poorer students. \"Higher education is going to be a harder struggle for those who do not come with all the advantages,\" he said.

But the mechanisms  behind this psychological phenomenon have remained unclear. A study now suggests that simply taking a break does not bring on inspiration -- rather, creativity is fostered by tasks that allow the mind to wander. The discovery was made by a team led by Benjamin Baird and Jonathan Schooler, psychologists at the University of California, Santa Barbara. The researchers presented 145 undergraduate students with two 'unusual uses' tasks that gave them two minutes to list as many uses as possible for everyday objects such as toothpicks, clothes hangers and bricks. After the two minutes were over, participants were given a 12-minute break, during which they rested, undertook a demanding memory activity that required their full attention or engaged in an undemanding reaction-time activity known to elicit mind-wandering. A fourth group of students had no break. All participants were then given four unusual-uses tasks, including the two that they had completed earlier. Those students who had done the undemanding activity performed an average of 41% better at the repeated tasks the second time they tried them. By contrast, students in the other three groups showed no improvement. \"We've traditionally found that rapid-eye-movement sleep grants creative insight.

It's possible that being full of vim and vigor helps the body fight illnesses, say the researchers from Carnegie Mellon University (CMU) in Pittsburgh. \"We need to take more seriously the possibility that a positive emotional style is a major player in disease risk,\" says psychologist Sheldon Cohen, the study's lead researcher. In a previous study, Cohen and his colleagues found that people who tended to be cheerful and lively were least likely to develop sniffles, coughs, and other cold symptoms . Those findings were interesting, but they didn't prove that a person's attitude affects whether he or she gets sick. Instead, it was still probable that a person's underlying personality is what matters. Evidence suggests, for instance, that certain people are naturally more likely to be outgoing and optimistic, with high self-respect and a sense of control over life. This would mean that who we are, not how we feel, finally decides our chances of catching colds. To figure out which mattered more (personality or emotions), the CMU team interviewed 193 healthy adults. The researchers talked to each person over the phone every evening for 2 weeks. They told the researchers about the positive and negative feelings they had experienced that day. The results showed that everyone in the study was equally likely to get infected. Their symptoms, however, differed depending on the types of emotions that they had reported over the previous 2 weeks. Among those who reported good moods and had been infected with the flu virus, for example, 28 percent developed coughs and stuffy noses. On the other hand, those symptoms struck 41 percent of people who had been less positive.

He approached the postal clerk and asked, \"Has anyone turned in any money recently?\" He told the clerk the amount, and the clerk laughed again. \"As a matter of fact, yes!\" she responded. \"It was turned in just a couple of minutes ago.\" The look of relief   on the young man's face is a memory I will have for a long time. He said he thought the money was safe in his coat pocket when he walked in to check his mailbox. Only when he arrived home did he realize that it was no longer there. I finally finished preparing the package to be mailed, but I was the one who had a very special surprise in the post office. What can we learn from the story?", "subject": ""}

Tourism might also cost the local people their livelihood and dignity. Local workers often find only menial  jobs in the tourist industry. And most of the profits do not help the local economy. Instead, profits return to the tour operators in wealthier countries, When the Maasai people in Tanzania were driven from their lands, some moved to city slums.

But now some non-government organizations, tour operators and local governments are working together to begin correcting them. Tourists, too, are putting on the pressure.

All the disorder was caused by one thing, the arrival of hurricane Sandy. This big storm landed on Oct 29 on the US east coast and brought damaging winds, flooding, blackouts   and heavy snow. Sandy is one of the largest storms that have ever hit the US, according to the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration. By the afternoon of Nov1 (Beijing time), about 140 deaths were caused by the storm as it traveled across the Caribbean islands and into the US. Unlike most hurricanes that happen during summer, Sandy was strengthened not only by warm ocean water, but also by the cold air coming from the northwest. Sandy's power grew because of the difference in masses between the warm and wet air and cool and dry air. It became a kind of \"super-storm\", the Guardian reported. The flooding was particularly severe. Scientists said it was because Sandy's arrival happened together with a full moon, which normally means higher-than-usual tides  . \"The most worrying aspect of Sandy is the high tides,\" Rhode Island Governor Lincoln Chafee told Reuters before the storm arrived. \"With the full moon on Monday, with Sandy coming up the bay, we're very concerned about flooding in our low-lying coastal areas.\" Apart from the power of Sandy itself, another reason why her arrival has caused so much damage is that its target area is crowded with big cities such as New York and Philadelphia.

When the tsunami   hit in 2004, there were reports that elephants in Sri Lanka fled to higher ground well before the waves crashed into the coastline. Panda researcher Marc Brody says some animal species, such as elephants who are known to hear low frequency sound waves, hear things very quickly and may get an early warning.   Some animal species have a greater awareness of shaking in the ground than humans, so they may sense smaller  _ before a big earthquake.   The tourist said, \"We were looking forward to seeing the pandas, but we were not sure whether the pandas were going to come out of the pen or not, So we were waiting for that to happen when we heard this huge noise which is just what you can't describe. What was it like? It was just a huge noise and the land was shaking underneath you. Certainly it was a terrible experience to be standing there going through the earthquake.\" Form the passage we can conclude that the author   _  .", "subject": ""}

Television has both sounds and images . It is much more real and interesting to watch television than to listen to the radio. However, fifty years later radio is still very popular and it will be here for a long time. One reason is that we don't need to see an image when we listen to the music on the radio. In fact, listening with your eyes closed is the best way to listen to a piece of music. You can imagine yourself on a sandy beach or up high on a mountain. In other words, you can create your own images. Moreover, while listening to the radio, you don't have to take your eyes off your work. For example, you can listen to the radio and drive at the same time. Or you can read a book and listen to the radio. Television, on the other hand, doesn't have this advantage. A radio is much smaller than a television. You can take a radio anywhere and turn it on anytime you want. In a quiet place you can use headphones to listen to the news or music on the radio. In this way you won't disturb anybody. Moreover, a radio is much cheaper than a television. For less than $ 20 you can buy a small radio and have fun with it.

But Xing Pu, a 40-year-old economist, is asking the government to give red packets to every Chinese citizen. Xing suggested the government give out 1,000 Yuan to each Chinese since the government income has increased rapidly in recent years. He said his suggestion would allow everyone to directly enjoy the fruits of the country's economic success, help the lower-income groups deal with rising prices and increase consumption around the country. Recent years have seen the government carry out a series of pro-poor   and pro-rural policies, including increasing spending on public healthcare and calling off the agricultural tax. But the lower-income group still needs more help while being hit hard by an 11-year high in prices and recent snowstorms. Xing said while making the draft, he has borrowed many ideas from practices in countries like the United States and Singapore.

The pavements  are stained with chewing gum that has been spat out. Years ago I remember travelling abroad and being saddened by the plastic bags and discarded bottles on every road. Nowadays, Britain seems to look at least as bad. What has gone wrong? The problem is that the rubbish created by our increasingly mobile lives lasts a lot longer than before. If it is not cleared up and properly thrown away, it stays in the undergrowth for years; a semi-permanent reminder of what a  _ little country we have now. Firstly, it is estimated that 10 billion plastic bags have been given to shoppers. These will take anything from 100 to 1,000 years to rot. However, it is not as if there is no solution to this. A few years ago, the Irish government introduced a tax on non-recyclable carrier bags and in three months reduced their use by 90%. When he was a minister, Michael Meacher attempted to introduce a similar arrangement in Britain. The plastics industry protested, of course. However, they need not have bothered; the idea was killed before it could draw breath, leaving supermarkets free to give away plastic bags.

All we really know is that men, unlike animals, somehow invented certain sounds to express thoughts and feelings, actions and things, so that they could communicate with each other; and that later they agreed upon certain signs, called letters, which could be combined to represent those sounds and which could be written down. Those sounds, whether spoken, or written in letters, we call words. The power of words, then, lies in their association--the thing they bring up before our minds. Words become filled with meaning for us by experience; and the longer we live, the more certain words recall to us the glad and the sad events of our past; and the more we read and learn, the more the number of words that mean something to us increase.   Great writers are those who not only have great thoughts but also express these thoughts in words which appeal powerfully to our minds and emotions. This charming and telling use of words is what we call literary style. Above all, the real poet is a master of words. He can  _ his meaning in words which sing like music and which by their position and association can move men to tears.

It also happens more often to fat patients, simply because there is more room inside them to lose equipment, according to the study. Two-thirds of the mistakes happened even though the equipment was counted before and after the procedure, in keeping with the standard practice.

The touch-screen devices are on show at the Food Marketing Institute's exhibition here this week, \"These devices are able to create value and get you around the store quicker,\" said Michael Alexander, manager of Springboard Retail Networks Inc., which makes a smart cart computer called the Concierge. Canadian stores will test the Concierge in July. A similar device, IBM's \"Shopping Buddy\", has recently been test-marketed at Stop & Shop stores in Massachusetts. Neither device tells you how many fat grams or calories are in your cart, but they will flash you with items on sale. The idea is to make it easier for people to buy, not to have second thoughts that maybe you should put something back on the shelf.     \"The whole model is driven by advertisers' need to get in front of shoppers,\" said Alexander. \"They're not watching 30-second TV ads anymore.\"     People can use a home computer to make their shopping lists. Once at the store, a shopper can use a preferred customer card to start a system that will organize the trip around the store. If you're looking for toothpicks, you type in the word or pick it from a list, and a map will appear on the screen showing where you are and where you can find them.     The device also keeps a record of what you buy. When you're finished, the device figures out your bill. Then you go to the checker or place your card into a self-checkout stand and pay. The new computerized shopping assistants don't come cheap. The Buddy devices will cost the average store about $ 160, 000, and the Concierge will cost stores about $ 500 for each device.

Three athletes fell over because of an accident caused by Elise Christie of Britain in the second turn and Li became the surprise winner.     Three-time defending champion Wang Meng of China missed the Olympics after breaking her ankle last month. Li had little experience in the race, where getting off to a quick Start is important. But she kept her cool while everyone else was falling around her.     \"I feel very lucky,\" Li said through a translator.     She and one of her coaches cried tears of joy after China joined South Korea as the only countries to win the same short track event four Olympics in a row. The Koreans won the 3,000 relay in 1994, 1998, 2002 and 2006.     \"I cried because I was so excited,\" Li said. \"My coach told me this medal is for Wang Meng as well, so I felt very moved.\" Li's victory made up for the surprising fall of teammate Fan Kexin in the semifinals. In the semis, Fan didn't even complete the first lap of the race, catching her left blade as she skated near the front. She crashed on all fours into the crew of workers who maintain the ice between races. They climbed onto the top of the pads to avoid being injured by Fan's long, sharp blades.     Arianna Fontana of Italy took the silver and Park Seung-hi of South Korea earned the bronze. Which statement below is tree according to the passage?", "subject": ""}

The scientists say that the human body has changed very little since human first appeared on the earth,but the way we live has changed greatly. Our body has not been able to deal with these changes in lifestyles and this has led to new kinds of sicknesses. These new sicknesses were not known in ancient times. So they are called \"diseases of civilization \".Many cancers and diseases of the blood system,including heart attacks and strokes are examples of such diseases. Scientists noted  that early stoneage people used very little alcohol  or tobacco ,probably none. Ancient people also got a great deal of physical exercise,but a change in food is one of the main differences between life in ancient times and life today. Stoneage people hunted wild animals for their meat ,which had much less fat than farm animals. They also ate a lot of fresh wild vegetables and fruits. They did not use milk and other dairy products ,and they made very little use of grains . But today,we eat a large amount of dairy products and grain foods. We eat six times more salt than stoneage people. We eat more sugar. We eat twice as much fat but only one third as much protein and much less vitamin C.

What do you think caused this change in colour? It is soil that has been washed into the river from the riverbank or from the nearby fields. Components of Soil Soil is made up of a number of layers, each having its own distinctive colour and texture. The upper layer is known as the litter. It acts like a blanket,limiting temperature changes and reducing water loss. The topsoil layer is made up of small particles of rock mixed with rotten plant and animal matter called humus  , which is black and gives the topsoil its dark colour. This layer is usually rich in nutrients, oxygen, and water. Below the topsoil is the subsoil, a layer that contains more stones mixed with only small amounts of organic matter. This layer is lighter in colour because of the lack of humus. Beneath the soil lies a layer of bedrock. Soil forms from the bottom up. Over time bedrock is attacked by rain, wind, frost, and snow. It is gradually broken down into smaller particles in a process called weathering. Plants begin to grow,and rotten materials enrich the topsoil. Most of the soil in Eastern Canada ,for example ,was formed from weathered rock that was exposed when the ice disappeared 12,000 years ago. Water Beneath the Soil Surface water collects and flows above the ground in lakes ,ponds, and rivers. Once in the soil or rock, it is called groundwater. Gravity pulls groundwater through the soil in a process called percolation . Eventually the water reaches a layer called the water table. Under this is bedrock through which water cannot percolate. As water percolates downward, it _ organic matter and minerals from the soil and carries them to deeper layers.This causes a serious problem because plants require these nutrients for growth. Soil pH Soil can be acidic, neutral, or basic. The pH of the soil is determined by the nature of the rock from which it was formed,and by the nature of the plants that grow and rot in it. The acidity of rain and snow can lower the pH of the groundwater that enters the soil. By burning fossil fuels such as coal ,oil and gasoline,humans have been contributing to higher levels of acidity in many soils. When fossil fuels are burned,gases are released into the air and then fall back to earth as acid rain. Acid soil increases the problem of carrying nutrients to lower soil levels.

It is possible that it grew out of the discovery that some people did certain kinds of work better than others did them. That led to the concept of specialization, which means that people would specialize, or focus, on doing one specific job. Let's take a man we'll call Mr. Fielder, for example. He did everything connected with farming. He planted seeds, tended the fields, and harvested and sold his crops. At the same time, he did many other jobs on the farm. However, he didn't make the bricks for his house, grind the wheat for his flour, or cut his trees into boards. He also did not make the plows , the work boots, or any of the other hundreds of things a farm needs. Instead, he got them from people who specialized in doing each of those things. Suppose there was another man we shall call Mr. Plowright. Using what he knew about farming and working with iron, Mr. Plowright invented a plow that made farming easier. Mr. Plowright did not really like farming himself and wanted to specialize in making really good  plows. Perhaps, he thought, other farmers will trade what they grow for one of my plows. How did Mr. Plowright let people know what he was doing? Why, he advertised, of course. First he opened a shop and then he put up a sign outside the shop to attract customers. That sign may have been no more than a plow carved into a piece of wood and a simple arrow pointing to the shop door. It was probably all the information people needed to find Mr. Plowright and his really good plows. Many historians believe that the first outdoor signs were used about five thousand years ago. Even before most people could read, they understood such signs. Shopkeepers would carve into stone, clay, or wood symbols for the products they had for sale. A medium, in advertising talk, is the way you communicate your message. You might say that the first medium used in advertising was signs with symbols. The second medium was audio, or sound, although that term is not used exactly in the way we use it today.

How do we remain calm, positive and even elegant in the face of all these difficulties of life?     That following suggestions may help.     It comes with the pay. I have a friend who used to complain about her dead-end job and unreasonable boss. Sound familiar? One day I told her, \"Look at it this way. You are getting paid for the annoyance as well as the work. It comes with the pay.\" This has become my favorite saying for work-related frustrations. \"Take every day as a bonus.\" When we learn to treasure every moment of what we have, we begin to see life in a whole new perspective.     It's all in the mind. Sure, the psychologists tell us it is important we work at resolving problems. But they also say if you try to resolve a problem that would not go away, it would only compound   the frustration. If you tell yourself there isn't a problem, there won't be one. It's all in the mind.     Stop thinking about your own problem ---help others instead. A lady who is combating a life-threatening disease revealed she coped with her illness by making herself useful, by offering help to others in a similar situation. She has spoken to at least five other women with breast cancer. She says that the sharing has helped her to find fresh meaning in her own life.     Never give up on your dream. Why do we give in and give up when meet difficulties? Is it because we have no confidence in our cause and no commitment   for what we pursue? It was said that Albert Einstein's last request on his death bed was to be given his equations and his unfinished statement declining the presidency of prefix = st1 /Israel. Einstein first picked up his equations and lamented to his son, \"If only I had more mathematics!\" What a great persistent spirit!     One strong-hearted lady was the late head of the tragic Kennedy family, Rose Kennedy. She said this on nationwide television one week after losing yet another son to an assassin's bullet---Boddy Kennedy: \"And we go on our way with no regrets not looking backwards to the past, but we shall carry on with courage.\"     Not the end of the world. Do you know something else? I've learned that care as you might, love as you might, some people just don't care back. And it's not the end of the world.

Most careers organizations highlight three stages for graduates to follow in the process of securing a suitable career:recognizing abilities, matching these to available jobs and presenting them well to possible employers. Job seekers have to make a careful assessment of their own abilities.One area of assessment should be of their academic qualifications, which would include special skills within their subject area.Graduates should also consider their own personal values and attitudes.An honest assessment of personal interests and abilities such as creative skills, or skills acquired from work experience, should also be given careful thought. The second stage is to study the opportunities available for employment and to think about how the general employment situation is likely to develop in the future.To do this, graduates can study job and position information in newspapers, or they can visit a careers office, write to possible employers for information or contact friends or relatives who may already be involved in a particular profession.After studying all the various options, they should be in a position to make informed comparisons between various careers. Good personal presentation is essential in the search for a good career.Job application forms and letters should, of course, be filled in carefully and correctly, without grammar or spelling errors.Where additional information is asked for, job seekers should describe their abilities and work experience in more depth, with examples if possible.They should try to balance their own abilities with the employer's needs, explain why they are interested in a career with the particular company and try to show that they already know something about the company and its activities.

People also took longer to fall asleep on the iPad nights, and the blood tests showed that their melatonin secretion   was delayed by an hour and a half. The researchers conclude in today's journal article that given the rise of e-readers and the increasingly widespread use of e-things among children and adolescents, more research into the long-term consequences of these devices on health and safety is urgently needed. Czeisler and colleagues go on, in the research paper, to note:\"Reading an iPad in bed may increase cancer risk.\" However, software has been developed that can reduce some of the blue light from the screens of phones and computers according to time of day, and there are also glasses that are made to filter   short wavelengths. While they seem like a logical solution for the nighttime tech users, it needs more research. Which of the following can be the best title for the text?", "subject": ""}

The museum has special proof of Porter's love of language---his dictionary. It's said that he read every word in it. Porter started a small publication called \"The Rolling Stone\".

But the universe is filled with dangerous things, all struggling to be the one to wipe us off the planet. Happily for us, they're all pretty unlikely, but if you wait long enough, one of them is certain to get us. But which one? 1. Death by Asteroid   Of all the ways we might meet our untimely death, getting wiped out by an asteroid is the most likely. Why? Because we sit in a universal shooting gallery, with 100 tons of material hitting us every day. The problem, though, occurs every few centuries when something big this way comes. If you could ask a dinosaur, I'd imagine they would tell you to take _ seriously. 2. Death by Exploding Star When a huge star ends its life, it does so with a bang, which sends death spreading across space in the form of high-energy radiation. Many studies show that the bang would have to be closer than about 75 light years to do us any harm. The good news: no stars so close are able to do the deed. 3. Death by Dying Sun The sun is important to us; without it, we'd freeze. But the sun is also middle-aged, already halfway to running out of fuel, expanding into a red giant, and cooking us to a fine crisp. Even long before then, it'll warm up enough to raise our average temperature and cause a runaway greenhouse effect, boiling our oceans. Happily, that's a long time from now. 4. Death by Black Hole Black holes are misunderstood. They don't wander the galaxy looking for tasty snacks in the form of planets and stars; they turn around the Milky Way just like the hundreds of billions of other stars do. But it's possible that one could wander too close to us. If it did, planetary paths would be disturbed, causing the Earth to drop into the sun or be thrown out into deep space. Given that it could be trillions of years or more before even that happens, we don't have to worry too much about black holes. My advice? Go outside, look up, enjoy the sun, the moon, and the stars.

{"answer": 3, "choices": ["you cannot think about", "you can't remember well", "you cannot understand", "you cannot see or touch"], "question": "Consumers everywhere are faced with the same dilemma: given limited resources, what sorts of purchases are most likely to produce lasting happiness and satisfaction? Recent research has confirmed that experiential purchases tend to produce greater hedonic   gains than material purchases. The reason why experiences improve with time may be because it is possible to think about experiences in a more abstract manner than possessions. For example, if you think back to a fantastic summer from your youth, you might easily remember an abstract sense of warm sunshine and youthful exuberant  , but you're less likely to remember exactly what you did day-by-day. Material possessions are harder to think about in an abstract sense. The car you bought is still a car, that great new jacket you picked up cheap is still just a jacket. It's more likely the experience of that summer has taken on a symbolic meaning that can live longer in your memory than a possession. Purchasing may have a negative impact on happiness because consumers often buy \"joyless\" material possessions, resulting in comfort but not pleasure. In general, people adapt to experiences more slowly than to material purchase. This can be seen in both negative and positive purchases: hedonic adaptation would result in a positive experience causing more happiness but a negative experience causing less happiness than the comparable material purchase with the same initial happiness level. Experience, however, seems to be more resistant to these sorts of unfavourable comparisons. It is because of the unique nature of experience. It's more difficult to make an unfavourable comparison when there is nothing directly comparable. After all, each of our youthful summers is different. It's well established that social comparisons can have a huge effect on how we view what might seem like positive events. One striking example is the finding that people prefer to earn $50,000 a year while everyone else earns $25,000, instead of earning $100,000 themselves and having other people earn $200,000.

But traditionally, the paintings are created to heal a person during a ceremony. The type of image and ceremony used is determined by the disease which the person is suffering from. The sand painting may contain an image of the Holy People. The tribe medicine man may ask the Holy People to help him paint the image and therefore help heal the person in need. When the medicine man finishes painting, he checks its accuracy. The order and the symmetry  of the painting symbolize the harmony which a patient wishes to achieve in his or her life. The accuracy of a sand painting is believed to determine its healing effects. In some cases, more than one sand painting might be used in a healing ceremony. During the ceremony, the person who needs healing will sit on the Native American sand painting. The sand painting serves as an entrance for the spirits and through the painting, the person can absorb the healing energies from these spirits. The sand paintings were not originally meant to be sold or hung on the wall. Once the ceremony is completed, the sand painting must be destroyed, thus allowing the sand to return to the Earth. This is necessary because the sand painting is now seen as poisonous, having absorbed the illness, and must be destroyed. The entire ceremony, from the painting to the destroying is usually completed within a 12-hour period. The medicine man never wrote down how to perform the healing ceremony, but it was passed down from generation to generation. The Pueblo tribe was the first tribe to create Native American sand paintings, but the art soon spread to many other tribes. Today, it is the Navajos who are the most active in creating Native American sand paintings.

The sand paintings were not originally meant to be sold or hung on the wall. Once the ceremony is completed, the sand painting must be destroyed, thus allowing the sand to return to the Earth. This is necessary because the sand painting is now seen as poisonous, having absorbed the illness, and must be destroyed. The entire ceremony, from the painting to the destroying is usually completed within a 12-hour period. The medicine man never wrote down how to perform the healing ceremony, but it was passed down from generation to generation. The Pueblo tribe was the first tribe to create Native American sand paintings, but the art soon spread to many other tribes. Today, it is the Navajos who are the most active in creating Native American sand paintings. It is believed that it was a medicine man named Fred Stevens who was the first person to create a Native American sand painting for sale in the 1950s.

There are other phrases meaning the same thing as \"apple-polishing\" -- \"soft-soaping\" or \"butter-up\". A gift is just one way to \"soft-soap\" somebody, or to \"butter him up\". Another that is just as effective is flattery, giving someone high praise -- telling him how good he looks, or how well he speaks, or how talented and wise he is. Endless are the ways of flattery.

We need it to be more sure of ourselves. It cannot hurt unless we get carried away by it. But we just lap it up for its food value and nourishment, as a cat laps up milk, then we can still remain true to ourselves.

We know the answer.They use their time smartly.     One day an expert on time management was speaking to a group of students and announced a quiz.He pulls out a wide-mouthed jar.Next,he places about a dozen fist-sized rocks,one at a time , into the jat, until no more will fit.\"Is it full?\"he asks.\"Yes,\"responds the class.\"Oh really?\"he asks.So he takes out a bucket of gravel . which he manages to work down into the spaces between the larger rocks.\"Is it full now?\"he asks.

The real reasons why bombs were dropped on two heavily populated cities are not altogether clear.A number of people in 1944 and early 1945 argued that the use of nuclear weapons would be unnecessary, since American Intelligence was aware that some of the most powerful and influential people in Japan had already realised that the war was lost, and wanted to discuss a Japanese surrender  .It was also argued that, since Japan has few natural resources, a blockade   by the American navy would force it to surrender within a few Weeks, and the use of nuclear weapons would prove unnecessary.If a demonstration of force was required to end the war, a bomb could be dropped over an unpopulated area like a desert, in front of Japanese observers, or over an area of low population inside Japan, such as a forest.Choosing this course of action might decrease the loss of further lives on all sides, while the power of nuclear weapons would still be adequately demonstrated . All of these arguments were turned down, however, and the general agreement was that the quickest way to end the fighting would be to use nuclear weapons against the centres of population inside Japan.In fact, two of the more likely reasons why the decision was reached seem quite shocking to us now.

At twelve she left home and was in domestic  service until, at twenty-seven, she married Thomas Moses, the hired hand of one of her employers. They farmed most of their lives, first in Virginia and then in New York State, at Eagle Bridge. She had ten children, of whom five ; her husband died in 1927. Grandma Moses painted a little as a child and made embroidery  pictures as a hobby, but only changed to oils in old age because her hands had become too stiff  to sew and she wanted to keep busy and pass the time. Her pictures were first sold at a local market and were soon noticed by a businessman who bought everything she painted. Three of the pictures exhibited in the Museum of Modern Art, and in 1940 she had her first exhibition in New York. Between the 1930s and her death she produced some 2,000 pictures: detailed and lively portrayals  of the country life she had known for so long, with a wonderful sense of colour and form. \"I think really hard till I think of something really pretty, and then I paint it.\" she said.

{"answer": 2, "choices": ["Men produce more sweats.", "Negative emotions have a smell.", "Pleasant feelings can be smelt out.", "Women have a better sense of smell."], "question": "Does happiness have a scent? When someone is happy,can you smell it? You can usually tell when someone is happy based on seeing them smile,hearing them laugh or perhaps from receiving a big hug.But can you also smell their happiness? Surprising new research suggests that happiness does indeed have a scent,and that the experience of happiness can be transmitted through smell,reports Phys.org. For the study,12 young men were shown videos meant to bring about a variety of emotions while researchers gathered sweat samples from them.All of the men were healthy and none of them were drug users or smokers,and all were asked to abstain from drinking or eating smelly foods during the study period. Those sweat samples were then given to 36 equally healthy young women to smell,while researchers monitored their reactions.Only women were selected to smell the samples,apparently because previous research has shown that women have a better sense of smell than men and are also more sensitive to emotional signaling--though it's unclear why only men were chosen to produce the scents. Researchers found that the behavior of the women after smelling the scents--particularly their facial expressions--indicated a relationship between the emotional states of the men who produced the sweat and the women who sniffed them. \"Human sweat produced when a person is happy brings about a state similar to happiness in somebody who breathes this smell,\" said study co-author Gun Semin,a professor at Koc University in Turkey. This is a fascinating finding because it not only means that happiness does have a scent,but that the scent is capable of transmitting the emotion to others.The study also found that other emotions,such as fear,seem to carry a scent too.This ensures previous research suggesting that some negative emotions have a smell,but it is the first time this has proved to be true of positive feelings. Researchers have yet to isolate  exactly what the chemical compound for the happiness smell is,but you might imagine what the potential applications for such a finding could be.Happiness perfumes,for instance,could be invented. Scent therapies could also be developed to help people through depression or anxiety. Perhaps the most surprising result of the study,however,is our broadened understanding of how emotions get communicated,and also how our own emotions are potentially managed through our social context and the emotional states of those around us.

{"answer": 2, "choices": ["The number of its customers was declining", "Its customers found the food unhealthy", "It was in need of financial support", "Most of its restaurants were closed"], "question": "Sparrow is a fast-food chain with 200 restaurants. Some years ago, the group to which Sparrow belonged was taken over by another company. Although Sparrow showed no sign of declining, the chain was generally in an unhealthy state. With more and more fast-food concepts reaching the market, the Sparrow menu had to struggle for attention. And to make matters worse, its new owner had no plans to give it the funds it required. Sparrow failed to grow for another two years. Until a new CEO, Carl Pearson, decided to build up its market share. He did a survey, which showed that consumers who already used Sparrow restaurants were extremely positive about the chain, while customers of other fast-food chains were unwilling to turn away from them. Sparrow had to develop a new promotional campaign. Pearson faced a battle over the future of the Sparrow brand. The chain's owner now favored rebranding Sparrow as Marcy's restaurants. Pearson resisted, arguing for an advertising campaign designed to convince customers that visits to Sparrow restaurants were fun. Such an attempt to establish a positive relationship between a company and the general public was unusual for that time. Pearson strongly believed that numbers were the key to success, rather than customers' speeding power. Finally, the owner accepted his idea. The campaign itself changed the traditional advertising style of the fast-food industry. The TV ads of Sparrow focused on entertainment and featured original songs performed by a variety of stars. Instead of showing the superiority of a specific product, the intention was to put Sparrow in the hearts of potential customers. Pearson also made other decisions which he believed would contribute to the new Sparrow image. For example, he offered to lower the rent of any restaurants which achieved a certain increase in their turnover   .

But in homeschooling system, as my friend mentioned, the kid has all the time and can plan his day accordingly. During the day the child studies just like other school-going kids but with no burden of homework and project work, the child has so much free time in the evening as to effectively interact and play with peers. The quality time the child spends in education is really impressive. Homeschooled kids have the opportunity to socialize more often as they have a lot of time in their hands. They can also make socializing a regular habit. Just as my friend said, her child goes to a neighboring park almost every day and has a set of friends who go there daily. Other children get back home to finish off homework and project work whereas her child who is already through with studies gets the opportunity to spend time with family members. When I heard this, I really felt how lucky the child was. Definitely the child had a better opportunity to socialize when compared with my kid.

In 1961, the average child began to watch television at age three; however, today it is nine months. Yet, most parents think that television has bad influence on their children. For example, in the early 1970s, my parents believed that my bad eyesight was the result of sitting too close to the screen, and they therefore made my stay at least six feet from it. Today, most people have no such worry, but many new ridiculous   sayings have appeared: *TV makes kids stupid. Many children watch more educational programs when they are pre-schoolers. When they grow up, they can read more books and have much better ideas to solve difficult problems than other children. *TV makes kids violent. The real story is not so simple. Hundreds of studies show that watching violence on TV makes children more aggressive  . But a study of over 5,000 children also finds that some positive programs make children kinder. The problem is that kids are increasingly watching shows with violence instead of those suitable for their age. *Sitting around watching TV makes kids overweight. An experiment finds that when children watch less television, they do lose extra weight; however, reducing their television time does not make them more active. The real problem lies in snacking  . A widespread habit for kids, and junk-food advertisements. *TV helps kids get to sleep. The opposite is true.

For example, in the early 1970s, my parents believed that my bad eyesight was the result of sitting too close to the screen, and they therefore made my stay at least six feet from it. Today, most people have no such worry, but many new ridiculous   sayings have appeared: *TV makes kids stupid. Many children watch more educational programs when they are pre-schoolers. When they grow up, they can read more books and have much better ideas to solve difficult problems than other children. *TV makes kids violent. The real story is not so simple. Hundreds of studies show that watching violence on TV makes children more aggressive  . But a study of over 5,000 children also finds that some positive programs make children kinder. The problem is that kids are increasingly watching shows with violence instead of those suitable for their age. *Sitting around watching TV makes kids overweight. An experiment finds that when children watch less television, they do lose extra weight; however, reducing their television time does not make them more active. The real problem lies in snacking  .

The pair decided to begin a strange, year-long project to battle their debt. The men, Ross Harper and Ed Moyse, set up the site BuyMyFace.co.uk. last October as a way to get rid of the $80,000 they shared as student loans. The idea behind the project was to earn money by selling their faces as advertising space every day for a year. Each day, they advertise a different business on their site by painting the brand's logo or name on their faces and including a link to the company's site. After they paint their faces and publish them on the site, Harper and Moyse go out to highly populated areas such as music festivals and theme parks to maximize their faces' exposure. At this time, Harper and Moyse have advertised their faces for over four months without skipping a day and they're more than halfway to their goal. Though they first started charging a minimum of about USD $1.60 per company, the prices have risen as their popularity increased. For advertising space during the remainder of April, they range between USD $250 and $750. Terri L.

He wants to make sure his grandfather is provided for when he dies. His memory of his daughter's suffering and early death gives him a fear of poverty. Gambling  becomes an addiction for Nell's grandfather, which results in his financial and physical ruin. Nell and her grandfather flee from their home and begin a journey that has no destination. For Nell, all she wants is a peaceful existence with enough to live on. They come across many interesting people on their travels and often meet with the kindness of strangers. Yet, in a colorful world, they also face the reality of the Industrial Revolution. From simple villages and fields of flowers, they go into a dirty city full of mass unemployment and plague   victims --- where children die of starvation and many are abandoned. The story isn't only about Nell and her grandfather, but also the people who are connected to them directly or indirectly. There is Richard Swiveller, a careless young man who is a friend of Nell's older brother, who wants Swiveller to marry Nell for the fortune he thinks she has. Daniel Quilp is a cruel moneylender, who manages to fool the grandfather into borrowing large sums of money from him. There is honest Kit, a boy employed at the shop, who becomes a victim even though he never harms other people. Kit desires to help Nell, whom he considers an angel that has always inspired the best in him. The mysterious Bevis Marks, who is a generous customer to some people and an enemy to others, also has his own reasons for looking after Nell and her grandfather. Unlike Dickens' other works, The Old Curiosity Shop is a book of contrasts: the purity of Nell compared to the dishonesty of Quilp, fresh air and scenic villages to the polluted, stone-covered city, etc. Even people's reaction to the book presented a cruel contrast. At first, Nell Trent was praised and considered Dickens' best character. Later, she was criticized by many well-known people like Oscar Wilde. While characters in Dickens' other books are moving towards a better future, Nell and her grandfather are fleeing for their life and their story is moving towards a sad ending.

Many cat lovers would go out and buy another cat. But one American woman was unable to bear life without her much loved pet cat Nicky. He had been with her for 17 years; and when she knew he was going to die, she had him cloned. Little Nicky was cloned by an American company, called GSC. But the new cat cost his owner $50,000. \"He is the same. His characteristics are the same,\" the woman told news reporters. The company, Sausalito-based Genetic Savings and Clone, made her available to speak to reporters only on condition that her name or hometown was not used. The woman said she feared being the target of groups against cloning. \"Nicky loved water, which is an unusual characteristic of cats. Little Nicky jumped into my bath.

Many people have said they felt disgusted at the amount of money spent on cloning a cat. They said that she should have chosen one of the many cats without a home -- cats like this are a common problem in many countries.

GSC said that if people were not happy with the cloned cats or dogs, they could have their money back. At the moment the cost of cloning is very high, but the manager of CSC said he hoped that eventually it would go down, and that in five years, the cost should be $20,000 for a dog or $10,000 for a cat.

The woman has only told news reporters her first name, Julia, but she has already received nearly 100 frightening letters from angry people, who say that cloning is against nature. Little Nicky was not only expensive, but also, like all cloned animals, may have more health problems than an animal which was born in the usual way. GSC said it had to try 80 times before it succeeded in producing a cloned cat. The company is now using new techniques and soon they hope to produce cloned dogs as well as cats. GSC said that if people were not happy with the cloned cats or dogs, they could have their money back. At the moment the cost of cloning is very high, but the manager of CSC said he hoped that eventually it would go down, and that in five years, the cost should be $20,000 for a dog or $10,000 for a cat.

He had been with her for 17 years; and when she knew he was going to die, she had him cloned. Little Nicky was cloned by an American company, called GSC. But the new cat cost his owner $50,000. \"He is the same. His characteristics are the same,\" the woman told news reporters. The company, Sausalito-based Genetic Savings and Clone, made her available to speak to reporters only on condition that her name or hometown was not used. The woman said she feared being the target of groups against cloning. \"Nicky loved water, which is an unusual characteristic of cats. Little Nicky jumped into my bath. Most cats are afraid of water, but Little Nicky is different: he loves it, just like my old cat,\" said the woman, who said she was in her early 40s and worked in the airline industry. The company delivered Little Nicky two weeks ago and was expected to publicly announce the news on Thursday. However, the cat's creation has raised heated debate.

While relaxing and enjoying the aloneness, I sensed a battle for favorable position between the highly-spirited water and the large rocks resting on the bed along the edges of the stream. At first; the rocks, stubborn, immovable and unbending, seemed to have their way with their adversary  . However, the water, determined yet forgiving, seemed merely inconvenienced by the presence of the rocks, as it effortlessly changed its course, running towards its original destination. Soon it became clear that the rocks, although remaining strong and firm, were losing this battle as the water's total indifference began to slowly reform these obstacles   into smooth and beautifully polished stones. You see, there seemed to be total lack of struggle associated with the water's journey. Struggle is like bondage   forcing harmony and the water would have none of that. On the contrary,the water seemed perfectly content to move around the rocks when necessary, following some route God had originally intended. I paused for thought. Maybe people need to be more determined and less stubborn. Maybe human beings need to always be open to different points of view, not afraid to readjust their direction as life presents all of its new and unforeseen challenges.

{"answer": 3, "choices": ["It filled Yeats's childhood with laughter", "It was shocked by Yeats's choice", "It was a typically wealthy family", "It had an artistic atmosphere"], "question": "William Butler Yeats, a most famous Irish writer, was born in Dublin on June 13, 1865. His childhood lacked the harmony that was typical of a happy family. Later, Yeats shocked  his family by saying that he remembered \"little of childhood but its pain\". In fact, he inherited excellent taste in art from his family--both his father and his brother were painters. But he finally settled on literature, particularly drama and poetry. Yeats had strong faith in the coming of new artistic movements. He set himself the fresh task in founding an Irish national theatre in the late 1890s. His early theatrical experiments, however, were not received favorably at beginning. He didn't lose heart, and finally enjoyed success in his poetical drama. Compared with his dramatic works, Yeats's poems attract much admiring notice. The subject matter includes love, nature, history, time and aging. Though Yeats generally relied on very traditional forms, he brought modern sensibility to them. As his literary life progressed, his poetry grew finer and richer, which led him to worldwide recognition. He had not enjoyed a major public life since winning the Nobel Price in 1923. Yet, he continued writing almost to the end of his life. Had Yeats stopped writing at age 40, he would probably now be valued as a minor poet, for there is no other example in literary history of a poet who produces his greatest works between the ages of 50 and 75.

{"answer": 2, "choices": ["changed their preferences", "escaped from the water more eagerly", "showed less interest in their favorites", "remained active as before"], "question": "Doctors sometimes prescribe light therapy to treat a form of depression in people who get too little morning sun. But too much light at other times may actually cause such mood disorders. Long-lasting exposure to light at night brings depression, a new study finds, at least in animals. The new data confirm observations from studies of people who work night shifts, says Richard Stevens of the University of Connecticut Health Center. Mood disorders join a growing list of problems, including cancer, obesity and diabetes--that can occur when light throws life out of balance by disturbing the biological clock and its timing of daily rhythms.  www.ks5u.com In the new study, Tracy Bedrosian and Randy Nelson of Ohio State University exposed mice to normal light and dark cycles for four weeks. For the next four weeks, half of the mice remained on this schedule, and the rest received continuous dim light throughout their night. Compared with mice exposed to normal nighttime darkness, those getting dim light at night lost their strong preference for sweet drinks, \"a sign they no longer get pleasure out of activities they once enjoyed, \" Bedrosian says. In a second test, mice were clocked on how long they actively tried to escape a pool of water. Those exposed to night lights stopped struggling and just floated in the water, a sign of \"behavioral despair\",10 times as long as the mice that had experienced normal nighttime darkness. All symptoms of depression disappeared within two weeks of the mice returning to a normal light-dark cycle, the researchers report. The scientists also could quash the behavioral symptoms by injecting   the brains of animals with a drug that prohibits the activity of certain molecules linked with human depression. This finding further suggests that light at night may cause something related to depression. Human studies linking nighttime light and mood disorders are important but can't easily detect molecular underpinnings   as animal studies can,says George Brainard of Thomas Jefferson University.

{"answer": 2, "choices": ["Good grades.", "The chance of finding a good job in the future.", "Money and experience.", "Good relationship."], "question": "I once studied at a major university in the Midwest United States. At the beginning of each term, I could see lots of undergraduates accompanied by their parents gather around the dormitory buildings. Fathers often helped children with huge luggage; mothers took much concern over children's necessities in university; while children were only absorbed in chatting with friends and getting to know each other, showing no sign of worrying about their future lives.        In fact, compared with Chinese parents, American parents care equally about their children's advanced education and make plans accordingly. It is true that some students begin to save money for their university education quite earlier---- for example, Amy, the daughter of my workmate Stevenson, planned to continue her education after secondary school. However Stevenson earned little and could not afford the tuition. Amy had to find a part-time job, working from 7 a.m. to 6 p.m. on holiday ----but for most American students, at least the majority of undergraduates,  _         Some parents not only take the financial burden for their children's advanced education but also try every possible way to help them. I could still remember that our teacher once said that American parents seldom offered help to their children, by which she meant to say that Chinese parents might be too caring. However every coin has two sides. For example, my academic advisor successfully got money from a major scientific grant to continue his research project, and then he hired an undergraduate Sarah to work with us. The fact is that research assistantship is usually competitive, especially to undergraduate students, and it turned out that Sarah was the daughter of my advisor! \"When I apply to the graduate school next year, the money I make and the research experience I build up will benefit me a lot,\" Sarah said. I used to think that American people behave like businessmen, but this small incident proves that they still might compromise the rules for the benefit of their children as loving parents. What benefit will Sarah get because of her father's care?", "subject": ""}

To find the mid-career average pay for 35 popular degrees, we turned to Payscale.com, which lets users compare their salaries with those of other people in similar jobs by gathering real-time salary data from its 35 million profiles. We then looked at the Bureau of Labor Statistics' employment estimate data to see how fast employment was expected to increase between 2010 and 2020 in popular jobs held by people with each degree. Finally we averaged each degree's pay rank and estimated growth rank to find the best and worst master's degrees for jobs. Physician assistant degree is at the top of the Forbes' third-annual look at the best master's degrees for jobs. Physician assistants are medical professionals who provide diagnostic and preventative health care services under the guidance of doctors. \"Both an aging population and health care reform are contributing to a higher demand for health care services,\" says Katie Bardaro, Payscale's lead economist. They don't earn as much as doctors, but their mid-career average pay is $97,000. Another advantage of a physician assistant degree: Employment opportunities are expected to grow 30% by 2020 (from the 2010 employment numbers), according to the Bureau of Labor Statistics. By our count, computer science follows close behind as the No. 2 best advanced degree for jobs. Mid-career average pay for these grads is $109,000, sixth best out of the 35 degrees in our survey. Employment opportunities for computer science degree-holders are expected to expand about 22% between 2010 and 2020. Electrical engineering, physics and economics degrees also make the top 10, all with an average mid-career salary of more than $110,000 a year. Not all master's degree holders enjoy anywhere near such optimistic job prospects or extraordinary pay. Biology, chemistry and history degrees are toward the bottom of the list--but that doesn't mean they're useless. If you're enthusiastic about these fields, the lower pay and slimmer job prospects shouldn't prevent you from pursuing a master's. Before you make a decision, you should bear one thing in mind: master's degree-holders don't necessarily earn more than other people in similar jobs--so don't base your decision to pursue one on the idea that you'll bring in bigger paychecks. It's also important to think about work-life balance and employee satisfaction for the common jobs associated with these degrees. \"You need to consider overall happiness,\" Bardaro says. \"If obtaining a master's degree causes an imbalance due to time devoted to education and potentially more stress at work, then one will need to decide if these costs are worth it.\" Physician assistant degree ranks first on the list because   _  .", "subject": ""}

We then looked at the Bureau of Labor Statistics' employment estimate data to see how fast employment was expected to increase between 2010 and 2020 in popular jobs held by people with each degree. Finally we averaged each degree's pay rank and estimated growth rank to find the best and worst master's degrees for jobs. Physician assistant degree is at the top of the Forbes' third-annual look at the best master's degrees for jobs. Physician assistants are medical professionals who provide diagnostic and preventative health care services under the guidance of doctors. \"Both an aging population and health care reform are contributing to a higher demand for health care services,\" says Katie Bardaro, Payscale's lead economist. They don't earn as much as doctors, but their mid-career average pay is $97,000. Another advantage of a physician assistant degree: Employment opportunities are expected to grow 30% by 2020 (from the 2010 employment numbers), according to the Bureau of Labor Statistics. By our count, computer science follows close behind as the No. 2 best advanced degree for jobs. Mid-career average pay for these grads is $109,000, sixth best out of the 35 degrees in our survey. Employment opportunities for computer science degree-holders are expected to expand about 22% between 2010 and 2020. Electrical engineering, physics and economics degrees also make the top 10, all with an average mid-career salary of more than $110,000 a year. Not all master's degree holders enjoy anywhere near such optimistic job prospects or extraordinary pay. Biology, chemistry and history degrees are toward the bottom of the list--but that doesn't mean they're useless. If you're enthusiastic about these fields, the lower pay and slimmer job prospects shouldn't prevent you from pursuing a master's. Before you make a decision, you should bear one thing in mind: master's degree-holders don't necessarily earn more than other people in similar jobs--so don't base your decision to pursue one on the idea that you'll bring in bigger paychecks. It's also important to think about work-life balance and employee satisfaction for the common jobs associated with these degrees. \"You need to consider overall happiness,\" Bardaro says. \"If obtaining a master's degree causes an imbalance due to time devoted to education and potentially more stress at work, then one will need to decide if these costs are worth it.\" What can be inferred from the passage?", "subject": ""}

Over the course of 40 years in the field, the zoologist learned how to fly airplanes and use some high-tech means to follow their movements. He also learned how to get out of the way fast. \"I learned how to climb trees very quickly,\" says Dr. Douglas-Hamilton, winner of the 2010 Indianapolis Prize. As co-founder of Save the Elephants, he has also learned to be an activist, author, and politician. When Douglas-Hamilton left Tanzania, in East Africa, in 1970 to study at Oxford University in Britain, he left behind \"an elephants' paradise  .\"But when he returned in 1972, the country's national parks looked more like a war zone. Douglas-Hamilton often found more dead elephants than living ones. Dr. Douglas-Hamilton now lives in Kenya with his wife, Oria, who co-founded Save the Elephants. Together they have written two books, \"Battle for the Elephants\" and \" Among the Elephants\". During the height of the ivory poaching  ,Douglas-Hamilton flew in small planes, helping bring back elephants in Uganda from the edge of extinction. He's been repeatedly shot at and has survived plane crashes, floods and diseases. He fought for years for a worldwide ban on ivory sales, which finally took effect in 1989. Douglas-Hamilton pioneered the scientific study of elephant social behavior. Among his discoveries: Elephants have a society controlled by female elephants and travel in families. In 2009, he worked to save a rare group of desert elephants in Mali from the worst dry weather in Mali's history. There have been other successes, particularly in East and Southern Africa. Douglas--Hamilton has proposed   the idea of a mobile national park, where the protected land would follow elephants as they travel. No country has yet accepted it. Even after decades of research, Douglas-Hamilton still enjoys the company of elephants. \"I love to sit with them and be with them, \"he says. \"I have the greatest joy just to be with elephants at peace.\" What is the passage mainly about?", "subject": ""}

He also learned how to get out of the way fast. \"I learned how to climb trees very quickly,\" says Dr. Douglas-Hamilton, winner of the 2010 Indianapolis Prize. As co-founder of Save the Elephants, he has also learned to be an activist, author, and politician. When Douglas-Hamilton left Tanzania, in East Africa, in 1970 to study at Oxford University in Britain, he left behind \"an elephants' paradise  .\"But when he returned in 1972, the country's national parks looked more like a war zone. Douglas-Hamilton often found more dead elephants than living ones. Dr. Douglas-Hamilton now lives in Kenya with his wife, Oria, who co-founded Save the Elephants.

During the height of the ivory poaching  ,Douglas-Hamilton flew in small planes, helping bring back elephants in Uganda from the edge of extinction. He's been repeatedly shot at and has survived plane crashes, floods and diseases. He fought for years for a worldwide ban on ivory sales, which finally took effect in 1989. Douglas-Hamilton pioneered the scientific study of elephant social behavior. Among his discoveries: Elephants have a society controlled by female elephants and travel in families. In 2009, he worked to save a rare group of desert elephants in Mali from the worst dry weather in Mali's history. There have been other successes, particularly in East and Southern Africa. Douglas--Hamilton has proposed   the idea of a mobile national park, where the protected land would follow elephants as they travel. No country has yet accepted it.

But many supporters have overlooked the reality that this new business model is largely based on escaping regulations and breaking the law. Airbnb is an Internet-based service that allows people to rent out spare rooms to strangers for short stays. Uber is an Internet taxi service that allows thousands of people to answer ride requests with their own cars. There are hundreds of other such services. The good thing about the sharing economy is that it promotes the use of underused resources. Millions of people have houses or apartments with empty rooms, and Airbnb allows them to profit from these rooms while allowing guests a place to stay at prices that are often far less than those charged by hotels. Uber offers prices that are competitive with standard taxi prices and their drivers are often much quicker and more trustworthy. But the downside of the sharing economy has gotten much less attention. Most cities and states both tax and regulate hotels, and the tourists who stay in hotels are usually an important source of tax income. But many of Airbnb's customers are not paying the taxes required under the law. Airbnb can also raise issues of safety for its customers and trouble for hosts' neighbors. Hotels are regularly inspected to ensure that they are not fire traps and that they don't form other risks for visitors. Airbnb hosts face no such inspections. Since Airbnb is allowing people to escape taxes and regulations, the company is simply promoting thefts. Others in the economy will lose by bearing an additional tax burden or being forced to live next to an apartment unit with a never-ending series of noisy visitors. The same story may apply with Uber. Uber is currently in disputes over whether its cars meet the safety and insurance requirements imposed on standard taxis. Also, if Uber and related services flood the market, they could harm all taxi drivers' ability to earn a minimum wage.

I know there's nothing you doctors can do about it and I've just got to wait until the day comes.\" As a matter of routine I ordered a chest X-ray. I looked at it and the blood results an hour later. Something wasn't right. \"Did your local doctor do an X-ray?\" I asked. \"Oh, I haven't been to the doctor for years,\" she replied. \"I read about it on a website and the symptoms fitted, so I knew that's what I had.\" However, some of her symptoms, like the severe cough and weight loss, didn't fit with it--but she'd just ignored this. I looked at the X-ray again, and more tests confirmed it wasn't the cancer but tuberculosis  --something that most certainly did need treating, and could be deadly. She was lucky we caught it when we did. Mrs. Almond went pale when I explained she would have to be on treatment for the next six months to ensure that she was fully recovered. It was certainly a lesson for her. \" _ ,\" she said, shaking her head, as I explained that all the people she had come into close contact with would have to be found out and tested. She listed up to about 20, and then I went to my office to type up my notes. Unexpectedly, the computer was not working, so I had to wait until someone from the IT department came to fix it. Typical.

Eating out is more popular in Britain today than ever before. However, eating out can be expensive. Restaurants are normally more expensive than pubs, though many pubs serve very good ,simple food.

There're many such \"unspoken\" rules -- they are normally only important when eating in a very elegant and expensive restaurant, and vary slightly from restaurant to restaurant and place to place. A recent nationwide survey showed that there was a divide in manners between the north and south of Britain ---the \"worst\" manners were in Scotland and the northeast, and the \"best\" in Wales and the southeast!

He says feathers are much stronger and last  longer than another plant material. \"Feathers are stronger. By design, feathers are also more durable . And the other part about it is if feathers were twice as heavy, or half as strong, then birds couldn't fly.\" He points out that traditional flowerpots made from other plastics can last much longer. But he wonders if there is really a need. He says most flowerpots are never re-used. \"Why would you want a plastic that you use for a year to last for two hundred years? It makes no sense. You want to match the product with the use.\" said Walter Schmidt. Walter Schmidt and Masud Huda are now adding another chicken product to their flowerpots -- chicken waste. The waste will add more nutrients to the soil as the pot breaks down. The scientists say they hope their flowerpot will be on the market in a year or two.

This is the case when only a few cells are hit, and when they are killed outright. Your body will replace the dead cells with healthy ones. But if the few cells are only damaged, and if they reproduce themselves, you may be in trouble. They reproduce themselves in an unusual way. They can grow into cancer. Sometimes this does not show up for many years. This is another reason for some of the mystery about nuclear radiation. Serious damage can be done without the knowledge of the person at the time that damage has occurred. A person can be irradiated and feel fine, then die of cancer five, ten, or twenty years later as a result. A child can be born weak or easy to get serious illness as a result of radiation absorbed by its grandparents. What would be the best title of the text?", "subject": ""}

Now she has a chance to see this wish come true thanks to build On, an American non-profit organization that is building a school in her community. For 17 years, build On has been sending American high school students overseas to create schools in places where literacy and formal education are usually out of reach. The organization has built about 300 schools in Mali, Malawi, Nepal, Senegal, Nicaragua and Haiti. Its goal is to get young Americans in mostly urban  areas to get involved in education. At the same time it can bring literacy to children and adults in poor villages in the developing world. Sounkala's school only has about 70 children; mud floors, poor lighting, few desks and an absence of books mean that the school is not the most ideal learning environment. Therefore they certainly could use build On's help. Samake hasn't been to school, but she wants a better future for her five daughters, including Ramatou, 12, and Mariam, 10. \"When a woman attends school, she will teach what she learns to her children,\" said Ramatou, who wants to become a doctor. \"She will also know how to take better care of her family.\" Build On tries to build schools for grades one to three.

Then her husband lost his job, and the plan fell apart. \"I have two kids in college, and I want to say 'come home', but at the same time I want to provide them with a good education.\" says Jacobs. The Jacobs family did work out a solution. They asked and received more aid from the schools, and each son increased his borrowing to the maximum amount through the federal loan   program. They will each graduate with $20,000 of debt, but at least they will be able to finish school. With unemployment rising, financial aid administrators expect to hear more families like the Jacobs. More students are applying for aid, and more families expect to need student loans. College administrators are concerned that they will not have enough aid money to go around. At the same time, tuition continues to rise. A report from the National Center for Public Policy and Higher Education found that college tuition and fees increased 439% from 1982 to 2007, while average family income rose just 147%. Student borrowing has more than doubled in the last decade. \"If we go on this way for another 25 years, we won't have an affordable system of higher education,\" says Patrick M.

They tend to look at life through the eyes of the person they are close to or want to be like. If their role model is optimistic, there are more chances of them optimistic. The role model becomes their standard of measurement. Because they follow the actions of their role models so closely, children adopt the personality and attitude of their role models. Children learn to like or dislike certain things by _ the personality and attitude of the people they admire. One reason why children keep changing their answers to \"what would you like to be when you grow up\" is that they are influenced by individuals in a certain field. Children view the social relationships (family or public) mainly in the light of the importance these relationships hold in the life of their role models. Their expression of their feelings is many times a reflection of their role model's outlook. According to a study, around 56% of teenagers identified with the role models. Out of these, those having personal or direct contact with their role models had higher self-esteem and were better at academics compared to those who didn't. As such, children who have positive role models, have more self-confidence and are more optimistic about their future. They learn to handle themselves well in social settings and positively interact with those around them. Of course, children who have their parents as positive role models have a well-rounded outlook towards life.

A study published in the journal, Science, has shown that body language provides a better signal in judging whether the observed subject has just gone through an intensely positive or negative experience. To test highly intense faces, Dr. Hillel Aviezer and his colleagues presented test groups with photos of dozens of highly intense facial expressions in real-life situations. In one study, they compared emotional expressions of professional tennis players winning or losing a point. To discover exactly how people view images, the researchers showed different editions of the pictures to three groups of participants: 1 ) the full picture with the face and body;2) the body with the face removed; 3) the face with the body removed. Remarkably, participants could easily pick the losers from winners when they judged by the full picture or the body alone, but they only had a 50:50 chance of being right when judging by the face alone. Strangely, the participants .who viewed the full image believed that it was the face, not the body, that revealed the person's emotions.

The Final Curtseywas written by Her Majesty's cousin and childhood playmate, the Honorable Margaret Rhodes. It tells in detail the story of Mrs. Rhodes's relationship with the royal family over eight decades. The book, showed with delightfully informal and never-before-seen pictures, has been written with the full knowledge of the Queen, who has read and approved parts of it.          Mrs. Rhodes lives on the royal farm in Windsor Great Park, in a house given to her by the Queen in 1980.

At the Queen's 80thbirthday in April 2006, Margaret gave an interview to the BBC in which she proved that, in her own opinion and despite several false reports, the Queen would not abdicate . Now, at the age of 86, she has written a charming autobiography that paints a first-time close portrait of the private world of the royal family.          Elsewhere in the book she reveals how the Queen Mother was a fan of the TV shows Two Fat Ladies and Dad's Army. Perhaps more surprisingly, she was also a fan of the poet Edith Sitwell and the Poet Laureate Ted Hughes, who was a regular and favoured guest.          Life at Birkhall, the Queen Mother's home of the edge of the Balmoral Estate, is described along with sometimes noisy dinners. Mrs. Rhodes recalls: \"At the end of the meal, Queen Elizabeth would start a series of toasts. As well as 'Hooray for...' with glasses held high, there was even more of ' Down with...' with glasses almost disappearing beneath the table.\" What makes Mrs. Rhodes write The Final Curtsey?", "subject": ""}
