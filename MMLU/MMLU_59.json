Three-D printers are used to make everything from automobile parts to bone replacements for human patients. American research scientists are now working on creating replacements for living tissue. Researchers at the Medical University of South Carolina have been working on creating and manufacturing living tissue since 2003.This process is called biofabrication   . It requires special printing equipment and a special kind of ink. Traditional printers require ink to produce an image or design on a piece of paper. For their three-D printer, the South Carolina researchers prepare complex nutritious solutions they call bio-inks. Bio-inks are made of proteins and glucose   , which normally provides energy for most cells of the body. The researchers also add living cells taken from the animal that will receive the new, printed tissue. The bio-inks are then added to a device that researchers call the Palmetto bio-printer. Sarah Grace Dennis is one of the researchers at the Medical University of South Carolina. She says new technology, like the Palmetto bio-printer, is a great help to the biofabrication process. The bio-inks are placed in three dispensers   , containers, inside the printer. Lasers control both the position of the printing surface and the places where the bio-ink is released. Michael Yost is a leader of the research team. He says the printing process is fully automated-- machine-operated. He says that the Palmetto bio-printer makes it possible to create complex tissue types. The researchers say bio-printing is still experimental. But they hope in a few years they may be able to print tissue to replace damaged human organs. But there are still some problems which need to be solved.

In his pictures, you could see everything very clearly, even the smallest details. This kind of photograph was called a daguerreotype. Soon, other people began to use Daguerre's process. Travellers brought back daguerreotypes from all around the world. People photographed famous buildings, cities and mountains. In about 1840, the process was improved. Now photographers could take pictures of people and moving things. The process was not simple. The photographers had to carry lots of film and processing equipment. But this did not stop the photographers, especially in the United States, where from the 1840s daguerreotype artists were popular in most cities. Mathew Brady was a well-known American photographer. He took many pictures of famous people. The pictures were unusual because they were very life-like and full of personality. Brady was also the first person to take pictures of war. His 1862 Civil War pictures showed dead soldiers and ruined cities. They made the war seem more real and more terrible In the 1880s, new inventions began to change photography. Photographers could buy film readymade in rolls. So they did not have to make the film immediately. They could bring it back to their studios and develop it later, meaning that they did not have to carry lots of equipment. And finally, the invention of the small handheld camera made photography less expensive. With the small camera, anyone could be a photographer. People began to use cameras just for fun. They took pictures of their families, friends and favourite places. They called these pictures \"snapshots\". Photographs became very popular in newspapers in the 1890s.

Wu died in the December of AD 737 at the age of 38 and was buried in Jingling Mausoleum.

In other words, it is a big chatting server, once you join a group, you are able to talk in an open forum  type environment or just one on one.   What IRC Networks are out there? There are about fifty really mainstream IRC networks (groups of servers) you can connect to. The most common ones found are typically, 'EF-Net', 'Under-Net', and 'DAL-Net'.   What is a Channel? A channel is the name for the 'group' you are joining, or the 'forum' in which you want to talk. On IRC, channels are denoted   as # Channel Name. For instance, say if you are interested in MP3 music, you may want to go to # MP3.   How do I get on IRC? To get on IRC, you will need to get a client program. I personally suggest using 'mIRC', if you are in the windows environment. I have used the program for many years faithfully.

From discovering how Vitamin D can best be absorbed, to unlocking the potential of stem cells, Wisconsin has pioneered remarkable breakthroughs in science that have improved health, saved lives and created jobs. These scientific breakthroughs have not only led to life-saving medical technologies but also have fostered   a strong power in Wisconsin economy. Across America, groundbreaking research supported by the National Institutes of Health (NIH) alone adds millions of dollars to our economy every year. In fact, NIH funding generated an estimated $58 billion in economic output nationwide in 2014. NIH funding spurs economic growth by supporting jobs in research and by generating biomedical innovations that are turned into new products. NIH-supported innovations also influence improvements in health that can bolster the economy, improve productivity, and reduce illness and disability at home and across the globe. But, budget cuts and inadequate funding for NIH in the past decade have put both medical innovation and our next generation of researchers at risk. Today, too many of our talented young scientists are deciding to do something else, or are leaving the country to pursue their research. Simply put, scientific and medical innovation depends on our ability to foster, support and invest in these new researchers. That is why I have worked across party lines with Senator Susan Collins of Maine and introduced the Next Generation (NextGen) Researchers Act. Our act builds opportunities for new researchers, helps address the debt burden that young scientists face today, and invests in the future of research, science, and innovation. This commonsense proposal would create the \"Next Generation Researchers Initiative\" within the NIH Office of the Director to coordinate   all current and new NIH policies. The legislation   also directs the NIH to consider recommendations from a National Academy of Sciences (NAS) comprehensive study and report on fostering the next generation of researchers. Finally, we must demonstrate a commitment to our future scientists who, like so many of their peers pursuing other fields, are struggling with crushing student loan debt. Our plan would also increase the amount of loans that can be forgiven through the NIH's loan repayment programs to better account for the current debt load of new scientists. Higher education should be a path to prosperity, not suffocating debt, and this provision not only helps make higher education more affordable, but can help give new researchers a fair shot at pursuing their dreams. The Next Gen Researchers Act will help to empower our next generation of researchers from Maine to Wisconsin, and across our country, with the resources they need to continue to lead the world in groundbreaking biomedical research and development.

However, scientific studies seem to have concluded that hypnosis is not only a true kind of treatment but also highly effective. There have been a number of controlled studies in recent decades and they all seem to agree hypnosis most definitely does work. Within this essay I will discuss just two of many studies about hypnosis and how they show that hypnosis works.               In a study released in the Journal of Clinical Psychology to test the helpfulness of hypnosis in losing weight, 109 volunteers (ranging from the age of 17 to 67) completed a behavioral treatment either with or without the addition of hypnosis. The treatment took nine weeks and during return check-ups both eight months and two years after the treatment the people who used hypnosis showed a continued weight loss rate much higher than the people who didn't. Those who used hypnosis were much better at achieving their ideal weight goals.               In 2009, researchers at Hull University found that hypnosis had an influence on brain scans. This shows that hypnosis had an influence on brain activity that can be picked up on brain scans. This shows that hypnosis is not just a placebo treatment   as some doubters claim it is. \"Our study shows hypnosis is real,\" said British psychologist Dr. Michael Heap who was involved in the study. This piece of research shows that hypnosis works and also exactly how it works.

In a study released in the Journal of Clinical Psychology to test the helpfulness of hypnosis in losing weight, 109 volunteers (ranging from the age of 17 to 67) completed a behavioral treatment either with or without the addition of hypnosis. The treatment took nine weeks and during return check-ups both eight months and two years after the treatment the people who used hypnosis showed a continued weight loss rate much higher than the people who didn't. Those who used hypnosis were much better at achieving their ideal weight goals.               In 2009, researchers at Hull University found that hypnosis had an influence on brain scans. This shows that hypnosis had an influence on brain activity that can be picked up on brain scans. This shows that hypnosis is not just a placebo treatment   as some doubters claim it is. \"Our study shows hypnosis is real,\" said British psychologist Dr. Michael Heap who was involved in the study. This piece of research shows that hypnosis works and also exactly how it works.               There are also studies proving that hypnosis works for pain relief, improving skin quality, improving confidence as well as helping with many other problems. If you've ever thought about using hypnosis but were not sure whether it would work for you, you should now have all the proof you need to use hypnosis with confidence.

All word marks, logos, product configurations and registered trademarks are owned and used under the authority of Oreck Holdings, LLC. For the very young and the very old and virtually everyone in between, the flu is nothing to sneeze at. So here's what you can do. Check with your doctor to see if a flu shot is right for you. Wash your hands frequently. Maintain a healthy diet and regimen of exercise. And because you're spending most of your time indoors, it makes sense that the air in your home is as fresh, clean and pure as it can be.  My Oreck XL(tm) Professional Air Purifier captures and destroys viruses, bacteria and germs. It removes mold spores, pollen, pet dander, household odors and other airborne particulates as small as 0.1 microns. (The flu virus measures 0.3 microns.) The Oreck Professional Air Purifier uses the same advanced technology as the prefix = st1 /U.S.submarine fleet where mariners are submerged for up to six months at a time. Because the permanent electronic filter never needs replacing, you can rinse it off as often as you like and it's as good as new.

Some are dying in bushfires, or being shot by farmers. Others are scratching themselves to death because of a mite  infection. Only 115 of one species - the northern hairy-nosed wombat - remain alive in the wild.  Wombats are endemic to Australia. They are found nowhere else. A wombat looks like an overgrown, stocky guinea pig, covered with thick grey fur and with a wide, flat, broad forehead. Fully-grown adults are about a meter long and about half a meter tall. They weigh about 40kg.  But while their looks are pretty straightforward, people throughout history have found it less easy to understand their behavior. The Aborigines  seem to have mixed feelings about them, According to one story, the wombat once said he was more powerful than the sun. After a competition, however, the wombat lost, and so today hides from shame, deep down in a hole. But another Aboriginal story tells of how wise the wombat can be. He comforts the other animals in the forest, after their friend, a cockatoo, has died, explaining to them all about forest spirits. Wombats are strong diggers, with very powerful front legs and sharp claws, usually used to dig winding holes in the ground for their homes. Yet despite their strong appearance, these animals are struggling to survive.  Many have been suffering a lot from a foreign mite, from foreign foxes, introduced for hunting by the early English settlers of Australia. Because of scratching, scars form over the wombats' eyes and ears, and infections occur, finally causing their death. Its population is so small that the group is becoming inbred . Competition with cattle and sheep for grass to eat, drought, bushfires, as well as dingo and feral dog attacks have all whittled away wombat numbers.

Some are dying in bushfires, or being shot by farmers. Others are scratching themselves to death because of a mite  infection. Only 115 of one species - the northern hairy-nosed wombat - remain alive in the wild.  Wombats are endemic to Australia. They are found nowhere else. A wombat looks like an overgrown, stocky guinea pig, covered with thick grey fur and with a wide, flat, broad forehead. Fully-grown adults are about a meter long and about half a meter tall. They weigh about 40kg.  But while their looks are pretty straightforward, people throughout history have found it less easy to understand their behavior. The Aborigines  seem to have mixed feelings about them, According to one story, the wombat once said he was more powerful than the sun. After a competition, however, the wombat lost, and so today hides from shame, deep down in a hole. But another Aboriginal story tells of how wise the wombat can be. He comforts the other animals in the forest, after their friend, a cockatoo, has died, explaining to them all about forest spirits. Wombats are strong diggers, with very powerful front legs and sharp claws, usually used to dig winding holes in the ground for their homes. Yet despite their strong appearance, these animals are struggling to survive.  Many have been suffering a lot from a foreign mite, from foreign foxes, introduced for hunting by the early English settlers of Australia. Because of scratching, scars form over the wombats' eyes and ears, and infections occur, finally causing their death. Its population is so small that the group is becoming inbred . Competition with cattle and sheep for grass to eat, drought, bushfires, as well as dingo and feral dog attacks have all whittled away wombat numbers.   But fortunately, a group of committed volunteers and scientists, working with the local government, has now put up fences to protect the wombats from meat-eating animals, made holes for extra shelter, and is working with zoos to create developing programs.

After we passed Mr. Lee, my mother stopped me and said something that has stuck with me from that day until now. She said seriously, \"You let that be the last time you've ever walked by somebody and not opened up your mouth to speak, because even a dog will wag its tail when it passes you on the street.\" Mother's words sound simple, but it's been a guidepost for me and the foundation of who I am. It's not just something I believe in; it's a way of life. I believe that every person deserves to feel someone acknowledge their presence, no matter how humble   they may be. At work, I always said hello to the founder of the company and ask him how our business was doing. But I also spoke to the people who cleaned the buildings and asked how their children were doing. After a few years of greeting the founder, I had the courage to ask him for a meeting. We had a great talk. At a certain point I asked him how far he thought I could go in his company.

Scientists presented some of their findings at a recent conference as the project neared its completion. In deep icy waters under Antarctica, scientists found bulbous tunicates, an underground animal, and many newly-discovered creatures believed to be related to starfish   and other marine creatures. Elsewhere in the world's oceans, they have recently discovered many kinds of underwater life forms new to science. It is all part of a research effort called the Census of Marine Life. \"There are about 2,000 scientists worldwide involved,\" said Bob Gagosian, President, CEO of the Consortium for Ocean Leadership. Gagosian helps manage the project. \"Everywhere they've gone they've found new things,\" he says. \"The ocean basically is unexplored from the point of view of marine living things.\" Researchers have placed small markers on hundreds of fish and marine animals to track by satellite their migration routes and to discover places where sea life gathers. According to Ron O'Dor, a senior scientist with the Census of Marine Life, knowledge of life on the ocean floor is especially limited. \"90% of all the information we have is from the top hundred meters of the ocean,\" O'Dor states. And he says the sea floor is, on average, at a depth of 4, 000 meters. And so, as some machines dive far below what people have previously seen, scientists are discovering new species of plants, animals and living things. Since the census project began, more than 5,300 new marine animals have been found. Ocean researchers say they hope to catalogue 230,000 species during the census --which some say is only a small part of all the creatures living in the sea.

Richard Blumberg,who led the study,is a professor at Harvard Medical School in Boston,Massachusetts.

Now, Dr. Blumberg and his team have what is the first biological evidence to link early exposure to germs to stronger adult immune systems. They say this exposure could prevent the development of some autoimmune diseases.

The National Center for Educational Statistics (or NCES) reported that U.S. colleges and universities received more than 9 million applications between 2013 and 2014 and admitted more than 5 million students. But the problem is not in the number of students, a new report says. The report is called \"Turning the Tide -- Making Caring Common.\" The report argues that the process schools use to choose students causes major problems. David Hawkins is the Executive Director for Educational Content and Policy. He says that most colleges and universities require many things from students when they apply.

{"answer": 1, "choices": ["Taking much salt during a run can avoid swelling in the body.", "Either too much or too little of water intake is harmful.", "A rich meal is helpful to our performance in a run.", "We should take enough salt during a run."], "question": "If you're training for a marathon, a proper plan for water intake   is important. Of course, there's the risk of dehydration   . But athletes now know they can also get into trouble by drinking too much. Too much water intake can lower levels of sodium   in the blood. The death of a 28-year-old woman following the Boston Marathon caught the attention of many runners and led to new research.  Experts advise long distance runners to replace the liquids they sweat out. Their goal is to try to keep someone from not getting dehydrated by more than 2 percent of their body weight.  One technique for deciding how much water you need is to get the exact numbers. Runners have to weigh themselves before and after a run to determine how much water they've lost. If their weight drops by more than 2 percent, they have not drunk enough water.  Hyponatremia   occurs when runners drink so much water that blood salt levels drop off. A study published last year tested 488 runners who completed the Boston Marathon and found 13 percent of them had dangerously low blood salt levels. The first sign that runners may notice is slightly swelling in the hands. They can't get their rings off, and then they might feel sick. They may not remember where they are. In fact, most runners get enough salt to get back to normal levels by eating just one meal after a run.

The Q80, if it becomes reality, will be brought to market by Infiniti's new boss, former BMW (another famous car brand )executive Roland Kruger.

Do you like to solve problems? Can you? If so, you could be the next great inventor. \"But I'm just a kid\",you might be! Don't worry about a little thing like age. For example, one famous inventor-- Benjamin Franklin--got his start when he was only 12. At that young age, he created paddles for his hands to help him swim faster. Finally his creation led to what we know is called flippers! So you don't have to be adult to be an inventor. One thing you do need, though, is something that kids have plenty of: curiosity and imagination. Kids are known for looking at things in new and unique ways. So what should you do if you have what is a great idea for an invention? Talk to a friend or family member about it. Get input from others about your idea. Then ask them to help you create a working model--called a prototype of your idea. Once you have a prototype, you can test it. Sometimes your idea turns out to be not as great as you thought. At other times, though, you realize it is a good idea and your prototype can help you figure out how to make it even better. If your idea is really a good one, an adult can help you contact companies that might be interested in it. You will also want an adult's help to get a patent for your idea, so that it is protected and can't be stolen by someone else. If you need some inspiration, consider these kids and their inventions: Jeanie Low invented the Kiddie Stool when she was just 11. It's a folding stool that fits under the kitchen sink. Kids can unfold it and use it to reach the sink all by themselves. At the age of 15, Louis Braille invented the system named after him that allows the blind to read.

At other times, though, you realize it is a good idea and your prototype can help you figure out how to make it even better. If your idea is really a good one, an adult can help you contact companies that might be interested in it. You will also want an adult's help to get a patent for your idea, so that it is protected and can't be stolen by someone else. If you need some inspiration, consider these kids and their inventions: Jeanie Low invented the Kiddie Stool when she was just 11. It's a folding stool that fits under the kitchen sink.

Still, 90 percent of the buyers would just sign on them without questioning anything. If anyone questioned them, we would reach an agreement on something that was acceptable to both sides. So when you see a preprinted application that contains questions or terms and conditions, read it all and read it slowly.

They see that people in this age bracket are delaying marriage.They're delaying having children.They're delaying permanent employment.People who were born before 1964 tend to define adulthood by certain achievements moving away from home, becoming financially independent, getting married and starting a family. In 1960, roughly 70 percent of 30-year-olds had achieved these things.By 2000, fewer than 40 percent of 30-year-olds had done the same. Yet with a little imagination it's possible even for baby boomers   to understand what it's like to be in the middle of the odyssey years.It's possible to see that this period is a sensible response to modern conditions. Two of the American best social scientists have been trying to understand this new life period.Through their work, you can see uncertainty that now characterizes this stage.Young people grow up in tightly structured childhoods, Robert Wuthnow of Princeton observes, but then graduate into a world of uncertainty.Old success recipes don't apply, new systems have not been established and everything seems to give way to a less permanent version of itself.Dating gives way to Facebook and hooking up.Newspaper reading gives way to blogging.For example, in 1970, 49 percent of adults in their 20s read a daily paper, now it's at 21 percent. The job market is changeable.Graduating seniors don't find corporations offering them jobs that will guide them all the way to retirement.Instead they find a vast menu of information economy options, few of which they have heard of or prepared for.

Dr King's work offers an intelligent solution to an age-old challenge, while providing further confirmation of the importance of bees to people and a really clever way of preserving the world's largest land animal for current and future generations. Working in Kenya, Dr King and her team showed that more than 90% of elephants will flee when they hear the sounds of buzzing bees. Afterwards, they also found that elephants produce a special sound to warn their fellows of the danger. They used the findings to construct barriers where beehives are woven into a fence, keeping the elephants away from places where people live and grow food. A two-year project involving 34 farms showed that elephants trying to go through the fences would shake them, disturbing the bees. Later, the fences were adopted by farming communities in three Kenyan districts , who also made increased amounts of money from selling honey.

Some will remember Beckham's miraculous recovery from an Achilles injury in 2006, when he was back on the pitch after only eight weeks. If he could repeat the same feat in time for the World Cup it really would be the stuff of fairytales. So, perhaps all is not lost.Optimists will _ from Alexei Lalas' words: \"You never want to write off David Beckham as he has shown us his ability to bounce back .\" .We may infer from the passage that   _   .", "subject": ""}

Of those who were dozing off, 29% have done so with their cars speeding at 70 miles per hour. The report also found a quarter of men have fallen asleep while driving, making it almost twice as many as women. The Safety on Wheel Report, by Post Office Insurance, also looked at how often tiredness or a lack of concentration caused accidents. Three in ten drivers have experienced an accident, from passing a walker crossing to hitting another vehicle, because of a lack of concentration. Meanwhile, almost half (49%) of UK drivers have driven when they do not concentrate. Paul Havenhand, head of insurance at Post Office, said, \" When tiredness strikes, drivers should avoid the roads.\" There is no measurement for tired driving, unlike driving under the influence of alcohol, yet it could result in an equally dangerous accident. Drivers are advised to take a 15-minute break from driving every two hours. However, a third (36%) are so eager to reach their destination that they will ignore feelings of tiredness. What's more, almost one in five (18%) will drive for longer than four hours without a break, while 6% carry on for up to 6 hours. Just over a quarter (27%) choose a quick stop to buy a cup of coffee, which is a very popular way for drivers to get rid of tiredness, and only 17% stop to have a rest until they feel energetic again. Mr. Havenhand added, \"Drivers should plan ahead and rest before starting a long journey; besides, they can take regular breaks to _ while on road; in some cases, if they do feel too tired to concentrate on the roads, they could consider an alternative means of transport.\" What's the purpose of the writer in writing this passage?", "subject": ""}

When Roger Haygood heard about the plan to tear down the building, he bought it so that he could store his collection of old trucks there. Then he had the idea of turning the building into a truck museum. During the past year and a half, the old building has been transformed into a treasure chest of memories. Instead of a dark and dull house, the building has become a cheery, bright home for all kinds of trucks from the past. The museum now houses 68 trucks, and we hope to have even more soon. There is a 1959 school bus, a 1942 bakery truck, and a 1937 fire engine. Our oldest vehicle is a 1919 milk truck. Our newest vehicle is a 1966 tow truck. You can take a ride on a fire truck, a mail truck, or an ice-cream truck. Rides are $ 2.00, but you can get a ticket for a free ride at any grocery store in Bentwood.

Such needle sticks are common. But a recent study found that medical students often fail to report them. Failing to report an injury like this can be dangerous if a patient, or a medical worker, has an infectious disease. Researchers at Johns Hopkins University in Baltimore, Maryland, did the study, which involved a survey answered by almost 700 surgeons in training in the United States. Almost 60% said they had suffered needle stick injuries when they were in medical school. Many said they were stuck more than once. Yet nearly half of those whose most recent incident happened in school did not report it to a health office. If they had, they would have been tested to see if they needed treatment to prevent an infection like HIV or hepatitis. Most known cases of HIV or hepatitis are reported, but other possible infections often are not. Martin Makary, the lead author of the study, says medical students who are stuck put themselves and others in danger from infectious diseases. Doctor Makary said, \"A needle that goes through the skin needs to be as sharp as possible.\" Doctors in training may have to do hundreds of stitches   in some cases to close the skin after an operation.

{"answer": 1, "choices": ["In an entertainment magazine", "In a science magazine", "In a storybook", "In science fiction"], "question": "For medical students, real experience begins not in a classroom but at a teaching hospital. These doctors in training are guided. But sometimes accidents happen and the students get injured. For example, they might stick themselves with a needle while treating patients. Such needle sticks are common. But a recent study found that medical students often fail to report them. Failing to report an injury like this can be dangerous if a patient, or a medical worker, has an infectious disease. Researchers at Johns Hopkins University in Baltimore, Maryland, did the study, which involved a survey answered by almost 700 surgeons in training in the United States. Almost 60% said they had suffered needle stick injuries when they were in medical school. Many said they were stuck more than once. Yet nearly half of those whose most recent incident happened in school did not report it to a health office. If they had, they would have been tested to see if they needed treatment to prevent an infection like HIV or hepatitis. Most known cases of HIV or hepatitis are reported, but other possible infections often are not.

Mr Farsund worrked as an engineer, while his wife was an intensive-care nurse at one point serving with the Red Cross in Rwanda, helping victims of the violent war in that country.Three years ago, a personal tragedy struck, when Mrs Farsund was found to have developed Alzheimer's . 'As the condition became worse, Mr Farsund began looking for a system that could help both of them live as normal a life as possible. He came across the healthcare technology company Abilia, which has come up with just such a network. At the center \\of the system is an iPad-like device. The screen has Skype, which allows carers to regularly check in with patients. It also has a planner for patients or carers to record up-coming events and provides spoken reminders about daily tasks, such as when they need to take medicine. Some l,000 people now have the system installed in their homes, and 25 of them, including the Farsunds, are testing the latest version, which combines the screen with wirelessly connected sensors. The motion sensors know if you are in the room or open a door, and send out alarms, for instance, if the stove  is left on for more than 15 minutes or a per.son opens a door in the middle of the night. The second is a particular issue in Oslo, where sub-zero winters mean some Alzheimer's patients are freezing to death. \"With.this kind of system, it allows people to take care of themselves, which is the most important thing,\" says vice president Oystein Johnsen. For him, any move to improve city life needs to begin with people. \"Smart cities are coming and they need to start with individuals in their own home,\" he says. \"It also saves the govemment money. In Norway it costPS100,000 per year to have someone in a home, while this system costs 15,000.

It takes a while, as I watch the surf blowing up in fountains at the end of the field, but the moment comes when the world falls away, and the self emerges again from the deep unconscious, bringing back all I have recently experienced to be explored and slowly understood, when I can converse  again with my hidden powers, and so grow, and so be renewed, till death do us part.

He went to the Whitney and spent the \"empty\" time looking at things in solitary  happiness. For him it proved to be a shock nearly as great as falling in love to discover that he could enjoy himself so much alone. What had he been afraid of, I asked myself? That, suddenly alone, he would discover that he bored himself, or that there was, quite simply, no self there to meet? But having taken a decisive step, he is now on the edge of adventure; he is about to be launched into his own inner space to the astronaut.  His every perception  will come to him with a new freshness and, for a time, seem surprisingly original. For anyone who can see things for himself with a naked eye becomes, for a moment or two, something of a genius.  With another human being present, vision becomes double vision, unavoidably. We are busy wondering, what does my companion see or think of this, and what do I think of it? The original impact gets lost. \"Music I heard with you was more than music.\" Exactly. And therefore music itself can only be heard alone. Solitude  is the salt of personhood. It brings out the authentic flavor of every experience. \"Alone one is never lonely: the spirit adventures, walking in a quiet garden, in a cool house, staying single there.\" Loneliness is very strongly felt with other people, for with others, even with a lover sometimes, we suffer from our differences of taste, temperament and mood. Human intercourse  often demands that we soften the edge of perception, or withdraw at the very instant of personal truth for fear of hurting, or of being inappropriately present, which is to say naked, in a social situation. Alone we can afford to be wholly whatever we are, and to feel whatever we feel  ly. That is a great luxury! For me the most interesting thing about a solitary life, and mine has been that for the last twenty years, is that it becomes increasingly rewarding. When I can wake up and watch the sun rise over the ocean, as I do most days, and know that I have an entire day ahead, uninterrupted, in which to write a few pages, take a walk with my dog, lie down in the afternoon for a long think (why does one think better in a horizontal position?), read and listen to music, I am flooded with happiness.

Says Dr. Levine, \"When social relationships are mastered, when individuals have mastered... a peaceful relationship with themselves, then they have ... the sense of humor.\" And then they can throw back their heads and laugh.

{"answer": 1, "choices": ["good memory", "hard work", "unique brain", "learning methods"], "question": "It is not unusual for people to speak two or three languages; they're known as bilinguals or trilinguals. Speakers of more than three languages are known as polyglots. And when we refer to people who speak many languages, perhaps a dozen or more, we use the term hyper-polyglot. The most famous hyper-polyglot was Giuseppe Mezzofanti, a 19thcentury Italian cardinal, who was said to speak 72 languages. This claim sounds absurd. _ But Mezzofanti was tested by critics, and they were all impressed. Did Mezzofanti have an extraordinary brain? Or are hyper-polyglots just ordinary people with ordinary brains who manage to do something extraordinary through hard work? U.S. linguist Stephen Drashen believes that outstanding language learners just work harder at it and then they acquire unusually strong language ability. As an example, he mentions a Hungarian woman who worked as an interpreter during the 20thcentury. When she was 86, she could speak 16 languages and was still working on learning new languages. She said she learned them mostly on her own, reading fiction or working through dictionaries or textbooks. Some researchers argue to the contrary. They believe that there is such a thing as a talent for learning languages. In the 1930s, a German scientist examined parts of the preserved brain of a hyper-polyglot named Emil Krebs, who could speak 60 languages fluently. The scientist found that the area of Krebs's brain called Broca's area, which is associated with language, looked different from the Broca's area in the brains of men who speak only one language. However, we still don't know if Krebs was born with a brain ready to learn dozens of languages or if his brain adapted to the demands he put on it.

Smokers who quit tend to pack on an average of 5 pounds after they stop smoking cigarettes. A new study, published by the journal Science, explains why this happens.               The new research explains that nicotine appears to combine with appetite-regulating neurons   in the brain, besides the receptors    that bring about addiction. These neurons help regulate how much food gets consumed, but under the influence of nicotine, they lose their self-control. This is why when smokers quit, they tend to eat more and gain weight.               The researchers believe that their discovery will lead to the development of drugs that aim at nicotine receptors on brain cells that control appetite. In the future, weight gain may no longer be a reason for smokers to delay the decision to kick the habit, but that's no reason to wait.

Nicotine-replacement treatment, while not for everyone, can help. Here are a few more ways to quit smoking and stay slim.               Drink water. To improve metabolic   rates, make half of those glasses ice water. Juice can be too high in calories, something you'll want to keep an eye on your journey toward being a slimmer non-smoker. Plan your snacks. Healthy snacks help keep your metabolism working, so you continue to burn calories while stopping wild hunger pain, or fake hunger.                Keep moving. Exercise kills two birds with one stone. It helps you burn calories and prevents you from eating when you're not truly hungry. It's also a feel-good stress reliever  . Focus on your fitness and how being healthy makes you feel. Make exercise a goal and think of quitting as your reward for being physically fit. The purpose of the text is   _  .", "subject": ""}

No surprises there. It is a difficult language to master, just like Chinese. I made a few suggestions based on my experience. One involved a very valuable fact which I learned from my high school Latin and Greek teacher, Dr. Smith.He is a gifted linguist  ,and has an amazing ability to remember things, like poetry, essays, speeches, etc.His advice to us students is that for memorization purposes, there is forty minutes each day in which our memory is more acceptable than it is during the other 23 hours and 20 minutes. This 40-minute \"super memory\" period is divided into two parts: the 20 minutes before we sleep, and the 20 minutes after we first awake. The theory supporting this is pretty simple. First, the last information we input into our brain before bed has a better chance of taking root than information gained during the noisy daytime; and second, our mind is free of disturbance  when we first awake in the morningso more receptive to inputs, like a blank slate . I took the advice to heart and it served me well in my school years. In my university days, our Chinese teacher would assign us 200 new vocabulary words each day, on which we would be quizzed the following day. Without the \"magic\" 40-minute technique, there's no way I would have passed those daily quizzes. As far as language study goes, it's not only useful for memorizing vocabulary. It's also a very useful window of time to listen to the language we're studying even with background noise, and even if it's at a level we find difficult to understand. It might be audio language study, aids, or just radio, TV or whatever. Beyond our years of formal  education, memory skills are hugely important in any career.

PenPals Program is a literacy-based  , traditional letter-writing pen pal program, available to all children aged 5-17 worldwide. At $10 per child, our program is a low-cost and fun way to help your children practice their literacy skills while they are making new friends. Groups of 15 or more receive a 50% discount. Children love our program because: *It helps them develop new (and possibly life-long)friendships. *It allows them to practice the traditional form of letter writing and correspondence. *They love getting letters in the mail from their pen pals! Parents love our program because: *It offers one of the few remaining choices for finding an established, safe and trusted traditional pen pal program to their children. *It helps strengthen communication and literacy skills taught in their children's classroom. *It helps open their children's eyes to a larger world, and other cultures and traditions outside their own. *Many parents remember having a pen pal when they were children and want to give their children the same positive, fun learning experience. *Parents love helping their children find new friends of their own age and gender. Frequently asked questions Why is there a fee? We are a small, all-volunteer non-profit organization, and the fees help cover our cost of running the program. How did the Amazing Kids! PenPals Program begin? The program began as a way of reaching out to the children affected by the devastating   hurricanes of 2005. Our hope was that by matching young hurricane survivors with a new pen pal, we could help them in their recovery from the trauma   they experienced. The program is now available to all children worldwide. We continue to welcome teachers, youth groups or agencies who like to work with hurricane survivors. How does it work? Amazing Kids! will match students of the same gender and age with other students who may share similar interests and hobbies, based on the information provided on the registration form. I've completed all forms and made my payment. What happens next? Someone from Amazing Kids! will contact you once a match has been found. You will be asked to call the other parent, teacher or group leader of the pen pal Amazing Kids! has selected.

{"answer": 3, "choices": ["50.", "75.", "250.", "425."], "question": "SAN FRANCISCO--Only 21 percent of workers worldwide are \"engaged\"--that's the word used to describe workers who are ready to expend some extra effort at work--while 38 percent are disengaged, according to a new survey. \"Engagement is not satisfaction or happiness, but the degree to which workers connect to the company emotionally, and the degree to which workers are aware of what they need to do to add value and are willing to take that action,\" said Julie Gebauer, a managing director of Towers Perrin, a consulting firm, which surveyed almost 90,000 workers in 19 countries. \"Happy employees don't necessarily create better financial results, but there is a definite link between engagement and a company's financial performance,\" Gebauer said. The survey found 21 percent of workers worldwide are engaged, and another 41 percent are \"enrolled\", which means they're on the road to engagement. More than 80 percent of the engaged employees say they contribute to the quality of company products, services and customer satisfaction, while only 40 percent of disengaged workers agree. Engagement helps retention  too. About 50 percent of engaged employees say they have no plans to leave their company versus 15 percent of the disengaged. \"The fact that almost 80 percent of workers are disengaged is likely costing companies money.\" Gebauer said. \"The conception of engagement is really a financial issue,\" said Gebauer. 'Organizations that have employees that are highly engaged deliver better financial results than those that don't.\" In a separate study, Towers Perrin assessed data on 40 global companies over a three-year period, measuring employee engagement at a certain point and then looking at the companies' financial results over the following three years. Companies with highly motivated workers enjoyed a 3.7 percent increase in profits, while companies with a lower level of worker commitment saw a decrease in profits slightly. What makes for an engaged employee? It's not necessarily pay. While the level of pay is important, it's not among the top 10 drivers of engagement. Rather than only using the pay, companies should survey their work force, much as they might study their customers, to assess what employees are seeking. According to the text, among 500 disengaged employees, how many would probably have the intention of leaving their company?", "subject": ""}

{"answer": 2, "choices": ["Three", "Four", "Seven", "Ten"], "question": "Do Americans have morals  ? That's a good question. Many people insist that ideas about right and wrong are merely personal opinions. Some voices, though, are calling Americans back to traditional moral values. William J. Bennett, former U.S. Secretary of Education, edited the Book of Virtues in 1993 to do just that. Bennett suggests that great moral stories can build character. The success of Bennett ' s book shows that many Americans still believe in moral values. But what are they?     One of the most basic moral values for Americans is honesty. The well-known legend about George Washington and the cherry tree tells this value clearly. Little George cut down his father's favorite cherry tree while trying out his new axe. When his father asked him about it, George said honestly, \"I can not tell a lie. I did it with my axe.\" Instead of punishment, George received his father's praise for telling the truth.  Sometimes American honesty-being open and direct-can offend people.  But Americans still believe that \"honesty is the best policy.\"      Another virtue Americans respect is perseverance. Remember Aesop's fable( )about the rabbit and the turtle that had a race? The rabbit thought he could win easily, so he took a nap. But the turtle finally won because he didn't give up.      Sympathy may be the queen of American virtues. The story of \"The Good Samaritan\" from the Bible describes a man who showed sympathy. On his way to a certain city, a Samaritan man found a poor traveler lying on the road. The traveler had been beaten and robbed. The kind Samaritan, instead of just passing by, stopped to help this person in need.      In no way can these brief descriptions cover all the moral values honored by Americans. Responsibility, loyalty, courage, gratitude and many others could be discussed. In fact, Bennett's bestseller-over 800 pages-highlights just 10 virtues.

Bennett, former U.S. Secretary of Education, edited the Book of Virtues in 1993 to do just that. Bennett suggests that great moral stories can build character. The success of Bennett ' s book shows that many Americans still believe in moral values. But what are they?     One of the most basic moral values for Americans is honesty. The well-known legend about George Washington and the cherry tree tells this value clearly. Little George cut down his father's favorite cherry tree while trying out his new axe. When his father asked him about it, George said honestly, \"I can not tell a lie. I did it with my axe.\" Instead of punishment, George received his father's praise for telling the truth.  Sometimes American honesty-being open and direct-can offend people.  But Americans still believe that \"honesty is the best policy.\"      Another virtue Americans respect is perseverance. Remember Aesop's fable( )about the rabbit and the turtle that had a race? The rabbit thought he could win easily, so he took a nap. But the turtle finally won because he didn't give up.      Sympathy may be the queen of American virtues. The story of \"The Good Samaritan\" from the Bible describes a man who showed sympathy. On his way to a certain city, a Samaritan man found a poor traveler lying on the road. The traveler had been beaten and robbed. The kind Samaritan, instead of just passing by, stopped to help this person in need.      In no way can these brief descriptions cover all the moral values honored by Americans.

People have no idea that they're messing up, Anderson said. \"You just go in the kitchen, and it's something you don't think about.\" She described preliminary  study results at a food meeting last week. Having promised the families anonymity, she didn't show the tapes. For $50 and free groceries, families agreed to be filmed. Their kitchens looked clean and presumably(perhaps) they were on their best behavior, but they didn't know it was a safety study. Hoping to see real-life hygiene, scientists called the experiment \"market research\" on how people cooked a special recipe. Scientists bought ingredients for a salad plus either Mexican meat loaf, marinaded halibut or herb-breaded chicken breasts with mustard sauce---recipes designed to catch safety slip-ups. Cameras started rolling as the cooks put away the groceries. There was mistake No. 1: Only a quarter stored raw meat and seafood on the refrigerator's bottom shelf so other foods don't get contaminated  by dripping juices. Mistake No. 2: Before starting to cook, only 45 percent washed their hands. Of those, 16 percent didn't use soap. You're supposed to wash hands often while cooking, especially after handling raw meat. But on average, each cook skipped seven times that Anderson said they should have washed. Only a third consistently used soap---many just rinsed and wiped their hands on a dish towel. That dish towel became Anderson's nightmare. Using paper towels to clean up raw meat juice is safest. But dozens wiped the countertop  with that cloth dish towel---further spreading germs the next time they dried their hands. Thirty percent didn't wash the lettuce; others placed salad ingredients on meat-contaminated counters. Scientists checked the finished meal with thermometers, and Anderson found \"alarming\" results: 35 percent who made the meat loaf undercooked it, 42 percent undercooked the chicken and 17 percent undercooked the fish. Must you use a thermometer? Anderson says just because the meat isn't pink doesn't always mean it got hot enough to kill bacteria. Anderson's study found gaps in food-safety campaigns. FDA's \"Fight Bac\" antibacterial program doesn't stress washing vegetables. Levy calls those dirty dish towels troubling; expect more advice stressing paper towels. Anderson's main message: \"If people would simply wash their hands and clean food surfaces after handling raw meat, so many of the errors would be taken care of.\" What is the main purpose of this article?", "subject": ""}

She had the grace of control to appear warm in the coldest weather, and on the Arkansas summer days it seemed she had a private breeze which swirled around, cooling her. One summer afternoon, she stopped at the store to buy supplies. Another Negro woman of her health and age would have been expected to carry the paper sacks home in one hand, but Momma said, \"Sister Flowers, I'll send Bailey up to your house with these things.\" \"Thank you, Mrs. Henderson. I'd prefer Marguerite, though.\" My name sounded so beautiful when she said it. \"I've been meaning to talk to her, anyway.\" They gave each other age group looks. There was a little path beside the rocky road, and Mrs. Flowers walked in front swinging her arms and picking her way over the stones. Without turning her head, she spoke to me, \"I hear you're working very good school work, Marguerite, but that it's all written.

The odors in the house surprised me. The sweet scent of vanilla  had met us as she opened the door. \"Have a seat, Marguerite.

As I ate she began the first of what we later called \"My lesson in living.\" She said that I must always be intolerant of ignorance but understanding of illiteracy. That some people, unable to go to school, were more educated and even more intelligent than college professors. She encouraged me to listen carefully to what country people called mother wit. That in those homely sayings was couched the collective wisdom of generations. When I finished the cookies she brought a thick, small book from the bookcase.

She opened the first page and I heard poetry for the first time in my life. \"It was the best of times and worst of times...\" Her voice slid in and curved down through and over the words.

Three windmills  were recently introduced in a Copenhagen neighbourhood, and the city plans to add another 97. \"We've made a very ambitious commitment to make Copenhagen CO2-neutral by 2025,\" Frank Jensen, the mayor, says. \"But going green isn't only a good thing. It's a must.\" The city's carbon-neutral plan, passed two years ago, will make Copenhagen the world's first zero-carbon capital. With wind power making up 33% of Denmark's energy supply, the country already features plenty of wind turbines. Indeed, among the first sights greeting airborne visitors during the landing at Copenhagen's Kastrup airport is a chain of sea-based wind towers. By 2020, the windswept country plans to get 50% of its energy from wind power. Now turbines are moving into the city and these ones will cost less than half the price of those sea-based. Having the energy production closer makes it cheaper, and land-based turbines are the cheapest possible source of energy available today. Fixing them also makes the locals more aware of their energy consumption. Though considerably less attractive than it was in ancient times, the windmill is enjoying popularity in the 21st century. \"Windmills are a symbol of the new and clean Copenhagen,\" says resident Susanne Sayers. Meanwhile, fellow Copenhagen citizen Maria Andersen worries about the noise, explaining that she wouldn't want a wind turbine in her neighbourhood. While Copenhagen citizens approve of the windmills, they're less willing to live close to one. The answer, the city has decided, is to sell turbine shares. Each share represents 1,000 kW hours/year, with the profit tax-free. With a typical Copenhagen household consuming 3,500 kW hours/year, a family buying four shares effectively owns its own renewable energy supply. To date, 500 residents have bought 2,500 shares.

Douglas, a description is given of people helping others but doing it secretly. When difficult problems worried an individual , friends nearby would meet to discuss possible solution  without the individual knowing their actions. When a solution was agreed upon, one or two of the friends would carry out the plan and solve the problem secretly, to the great delight of the worried individual. The helpers would stand by privately , content with their success. No reward was given to the problem solvers, not even a sincere \"thank you\", because they were never known. This concept is popular today but in a different way. The phrase _ is now used when one person helps another. However, the person helped may not be able to repay the person or group that helped them. So rather than return the favor to their helpers, they are supposed to help someone else in the future, which means they pay it forward. It is a sense of responsibility which makes us want to give back in equal measure to the one who has helped us. But, in this case, the responsibility turns to helping someone in the future. Suppose your elderly grandmother pays part of your schooling. She may tell you there is no need to repay her because it is a gift from someone who loves you very much. Nothing would please her more than to have you use her money to get a good education. You may never be able to repay her for such a gift. However, she not only gave you some money, but she provided you with an example that you should also help other people who need it. People with serious needs are everywhere.

However, if you want to study oceanography , your interests may be better served by attending school in a place that is on a coastline or near the ocean. Now I am sure that you know which schools are considered the best in the country. So I will tell you about which states I believe are the best to live in. California is a nice state. Northern California specifically has very good weather. Los Angeles in southern California is another story, though. Life in LA is full of excitement and fast, and sometimes dangerous. As for me, I enjoyed the time I spent in Massachusetts, Virginia and Maryland and these states have a lot of history and culture. The weather is not as perfect as Northern California, but it is still quite nice. My favorite area of America is the Mid-west. Middle America, I think, is home to the true American sense of values. In addition, there are many good universities there. Also, you need to think about your likes and dislikes and then research the various states. You like sunshine and hate snow? Then you probably won't like the Midwest or even the Northeast. Open space, nature and peace? Then you probably should stay away from America's large cities. Are you interested in government?

Over the last year, micro-blogging has become wildly popular in China, with some 65 million China based micro-blog accounts registered  by the end of 2010 and the number is growing by more than 10 million each month, according to Data Center of the China Internet (DCCI).

An Internet surfer nicknamed Xiaoben posted on his micro-blog page that he enjoyed drinking Puer tea, and within 10 minutes, a micro-blogger who owned an online shop selling Puer tea recommended his shop to Xiaoben. \"It is a little bit like magic.

Further, a brand can be as easily damaged as established through micro-blogging, as consumers' negative feedback about a certain product or company can be very quickly spread in the micro-blog community, Huang added.

My mother once took me to a store when I was seven years old. She and I got to the checkout counter, and she realized she had forgotten a couple of things on her shopping list. She left me with the cart and ran off to get what she needed. \"I'll be right back.\" she said. She was gone just a few minutes, but in that time, I had loaded all the things on the belt and everything was rung up. I was left staring at the cashier, who was staring at me.\" Do you have money for me, son?\" she said. \"I'll need to be paid.\"  I didn't realize she was just trying to amuse herself. So I stood there, ashamed and embarrassed. By the time my mom returned, I was angry. \"You left me here with no money! This lady asked me for the money, and I had nothing to give her!\" Now that I'm an adult, you'll never catch me with less than $200 in my wallet. I want to be prepared in case I need it. I've always admired people who are over-prepared. In college, I had a classmate named Norman. One day he was giving a presentation on an overhead projector   and in the middle of his talk, the light bulb on the projector blew out. We would have to wait ten minutes until someone found a new' projector. \"It's Okay.\" he announced. \"There's nothing to worry about.\" We watched him walk over to his bag and pull something out. He had brought along a spare bulb for the Overhead projector. Who could even think of that?

Clearly, they never looked closely at ants. A new study suggests that ant colonies avoid irrational decisions that people and other animals often make. Consider the following scenario: You want to buy a house with a big kitchen and a big yard, but there are only two homes on the market---one with a big kitchen and a small yard and the other with a small kitchen and a big yard. Studies show you'd be about 50% likely to choose either house---and either one would be a rational choice. But now, a new home comes on the market, this one with a large kitchen and no yard. This time, studies show, you'll make an irrational decision: Even though nothing has changed with the first two houses, you'll now favor the house with the big kitchen and small yard over the one with the small kitchen and big yard. Overall, scientists have found, people and other animals will often change their original preferences when presented with a third choice. Not so with ants. These insects also shop for homes but not quite in the way that humans do. Solitary worker ants spread out, looking for two main features: a small entrance and a dark inside. If an ant finds an outstanding hole---such as the inside of an acorn or a rock crevice---it brings another worker ant to check it out. As more ants like the site, the number of workers in the new hole grows. Once the crowd reaches a critical mass, the ants race back to the old nest and start carrying the queen and larvae to move the entire colony. To test ant rationality, Stephen Pratt, a behavioral ecologist at Arizona State University in Tempe, and a colleague designed a series of possible nests for 26 ant colonies. The duo cut rectangular holes in balsa wood and covered them with glass microscope slides. The researchers then drilled holes of various sizes into the glass slides and slipped plastic light filters under the glass to vary the features ants care about most. At first, the colonies only had two options, A and B. A was dark but had a large opening, whereas B was bright with a small opening. As with humans, the ants preferred both options equally: The researchers found no difference between the number of colonies that picked A versus B. Then the scientists added a third option, called a decoy , that was similar to either A or B in one characteristic but clearly worse than both in the other (a very bright nest with a small opening, for example). Unlike humans, the ants were not tricked by the decoy, the team reports online today in the Proceedings of the Royal Society B. Although a few colonies picked the third nest, the other colonies did not start favoring A or B and still split evenly between the two. Pratt speculates that ant colonies avoid making the irrational decision because, unlike humans, each ant doesn't evaluate all options before making a choice. When the scouts find a nest, they're unaware of what else is out there, and either they pick the nest or they don't. \"The group may do better precisely because the individuals are ignorant,\" Pratt says.

To know the value of dreams,you have to understand what happens when you are asleep.Even then,a part of your mind is still working.This unconscious ,but still active part understands your experiences and goes to work on the problems you have had during the day.It stores all sorts of information that you may have forgotten or never have really noticed.It is only when you fall asleep that this part of the brain can send messages to the part you use when you are awake.However,the unconscious part acts in a special way.It uses strange images which the conscious part may not understand at first.This is why dreams are sometimes called \"secret messages to ourselves \".

Little children can learn to swim as soon as they walk. In fact, you need the same skills in walking as in swimming. However, I believe that five is the best age to learn. By five or six, a child knows fear of water, a very important thing to know. It's wise to be afraid, to recognize true danger. Young ones understand that the water can sometimes be very dangerous.      To really benefit from swimming, every swimmer should learn, as soon as possible, these four basic strokes; butterfly, backstroke, Breaststroke, and crawl. I feel that one of these-the breaststroke-is different from the others, since some young swimmers use this stroke naturally, without any training. In swimming there are certain rules every swimmer should follow: 1). Never swim alone! No matter how good you are in the water, don't risk drowning by swimming alone. If you swim by yourself, with no life guards or friends with you, you may get into trouble. 2). Don't go beyond your abilities. Most swimmers know enough not to swim too far from the bank or the beach, Showing off by doing dangerous tricks is no good. Swim safely and you will continue to swim and alive. 3). Don't smoke.

Researchers listened to audio recordings of parents playing with their babies aged 10 months to 16 months.

There was even more information given by parents as their babies looked at the pictures in books.

The new research suggests that standard tests may ignore patients who have some consciousness, and that someday some kind of communication may be possible. In the strongest example, a 29-year-old patient was able to answer yes-or-no questions by picturing specific scenes the doctors asked him to imagine. \"We were stunned when this happened,\" said one study author, Martin Monti of the Brain Sciences Unit in Cambridge. \"I find it really amazing. This was a patient who was believed to be vegetative for five years.\" Ever since a research paper four years ago described obvious signs of awareness in a vegetative patient, families of patients have been demanding brain scans, said Dr. James Bernat, a spokesman for the American Academy for Neurology.

Experts also pointed out that only a few tested patients showed evidence of awareness. And they said it is not clear what degree of consciousness and mental abilities the signs imply. They also noted that the positive signals appeared only in people with traumatic  brain injury---not in patients whose brains had been lacking in oxygen, as can happen when the heart stops. The new study used brain scanning called functional MRI, for 23 patients in a vegetative state and 31 that are minimally  conscious.

Even the residents who don't have amazing memories make the experience satisfying . I remember visiting Mrs Robinson. She couldn't recall much about her past, but she told me she'd never forget how kind I was just to listen to her \"rambling  \". It made me realize that it's the little things that make life worth living. That's something I won't forget anytime soon.

And despite how busy our lives are, there's always time to make someone's day. For me, it feels great to be a source of happiness, a smile on a bad day or a listening ear for old memories.

{"answer": 3, "choices": ["Bats.", "Monkeys.", "Infected humans.", "Something unknown."], "question": "The World Health Organization reports a number of people have died of the Ebola virus in central  Africa during the last few months. Ebola, also known as Ebola hemorrhagic   fever or Ebola viral disease, is a rare and deadly illness with high death rates in humans and primates. The natural source of Ebola virus remains unknown, although bats seem to be the most likely source. The Ebola virus began spreading after victims were discovered in northeastern Gabon. So far, it is the third time Ebola has spread through Gabon since 1994. Health officials believe people moving across the border spread the disease from Gabon to Congo. Ebola is highly infectious and kills up to 80% of its victims. Researchers do not know the method with which the virus first appears in humans, but they believe it is through infected animals. The disease then spreads from person to person through blood and other body liquids. Ebola victims treated early have the base chance of survival. Signs of Ebola include a high temperature, diarrhea, muscle pains and bleeding inside the body, in severe cases, victims experience chest pains and death. There is no known cure for the disease and no way yet to prevent it. Scientists at the American National institutes of Health are working to develop a vaccine  to prevent Ebola. Doctor Cary Nobel is leading the research effort at N-l-H testing center in the eastern state of Maryland. He says that during the past two years, the vaccine has been tested on small animals and monkeys for safety and effectiveness. In the most recent study, four monkeys who had been given the vaccine were completely protected from a deadly injection of the Ebola virus. The study was described in November in Nature magazine. Doctor Nobel says the tests appear to have moved scientists one step closer to a vaccine for humans. Where does the Ebola virus come from?", "subject": ""}

Samuel Clemens often heard these words when he was young,and he used them as a pen name all his life. During his work on the Mississippi he met travelers of all kinds,and this helped him a great deal when he started to write.But the number of travelers became smaller when war started in America in 1861.Many of the great ships on the river stopped work.Samuel left then and went to Nevada with his brother,who was at that time Governor of Nevada.There,near the town of Carson,Samuel became a gold miner,but he never made much money at the time.He soon saw that life in the gold mines was not for him.He also tried writing for the newspapers in Nevada,and this seemed more hopeful.He found that he could write.

{"answer": 3, "choices": ["It is cheap to make and buy.", "It can leave voice messages.", "It makes online shopping easy.", "It makes fraud more difficult."], "question": "The card using a built-in voice-recognition chip requires users to give a spoken password that it recognizes. The idea is to prevent thieves from using a stolen card to buy goods online.  A model built by engineers in California packs a microphone, a loudspeaker, a battery and a voice-recognition chip into a standard-sized credit card. The card is the length and width of an ordinary credit card but about three times as thick. The company now plans to make it thinner.  The voice card is based on an earlier Beep card technology designed to prevent fraud in online deals. The Beep card has no microphone, but has a built-in loudspeaker to utter an audible   ID signal by a computer's microphone to an online server . By confirming that signal matches the information in the card, the server can make sure that the user is not simply keying in a credit card number but actually has the card in his hand. The ID code, which only the server knows, changes each time the card is used.  This prevents fraudsters recording the beeps, noting the card details and then playing back the audible ID when they key in the details later. But this earlier Beep card technology cannot prevent illegal use of stolen cards. The new voice card can. The new voice card doesn't identify itself by its ID until it has confirmed the real user's spoken password. Thieves will be unable to use the card because even if they knew the password they would have to be able to copy the owner's voice with a high degree of accuracy. The challenge for Beep card has been to develop voice-recognition and audio circuitry .  The voice-recognition credit is powered by a mini battery. To extend batter life, the electronics have only to be switched on when the card is being used. Pressing a button on the card's surface allows one to hear a female voice saying, \"Say your password.\" If the voice-recognition software proves that the password is real, it sends its ID, which the server then identifies, allowing the deal to continue.

Slowly, they let us lead them, some-times rising from the water right beside us to breathe----and to give us a trusting look with those huge eyes. Once they hit their first part of clean water flowing straight from the sea, the mum gave us a wave with her tail and off they swam into the distance.

On approaching them, we saw it was a mother whale with her baby. We couldn't believe it ----there aren't any whales along the coast here. The storm must have driven them across the ocean into the bay, in which the still water was so badly polluted that nothing could survive. The little baby whale----actually as big as our boat----was obviously stuck and could not move. The mother dived under the water and came up suddenly, making big whirlpools  and waves. \"She's trying to help her baby, but on the wrong side, \"my father said. At this point, my father moved our boat in a semicircle to the other side and, heading the boat towards the baby whale, pushed it gently. With our several gentle pushes the big hump turned over and disappeared under water. Then it swam up right beside its mum. They struggled in their desperate attempts to escape but missed the exit and started heading in the wrong direction. We hurried up to the whales and tried to lead them towards the bay channel. Slowly, they let us lead them, some-times rising from the water right beside us to breathe----and to give us a trusting look with those huge eyes. Once they hit their first part of clean water flowing straight from the sea, the mum gave us a wave with her tail and off they swam into the distance. In the excitement it had felt like only a few minutes, but we had been with those wonderful animals for almost an hour and a half.

To do this, teachers and actually everyone else in a community, should play a role as a \"cognitive coach\" to students, helping develop good thinkers among our youth. The best way for you to become a cognitive coach is to seek out and engage school children and adolescents in meaningful conversations. The objective here is to get kids talking about what they think, how they feel, and what they believe whenever and wherever you may find them. It may be in a classroom. It may be at the grocery store. It may be at a basketball game. It doesn't matter where as long as you engage students in a topical conversation and, hopefully, even a debate. Mainly, you want to encourage students to voice their opinion about things. Get them to take a position on \"this thing, or that thing,\" and ask them to support their position with evidence. Curiously enough, the simple process of engaging students in real life conversations and debates will serve to strengthen what they have learned in the classroom, and help them create their own knowledge about a subject or a topic. Learning indicates that a student has been exposed to material, understands the material, and can recall the information. Knowledge, on the other hand, goes beyond recall and includes information processing, application to other situations, consideration of meaning, and contrasting with other concepts. Naturally, the topic of conversation you engage in with one of your learners will differ from student to student, and in the level of complexity based on child's age and developmental level. Even a kindergartener has an opinion about things that are going on in his or her life. Engaging in conversation with any members of your learning community in ways that get at what they have learned and what they know will help them develop higher order reasoning skills. A student's synthetic thinking  process occurs when a respected adult asks a question, particularly a question that requires reflection.

In 1991,he came up with a system to organize,link and browse  Net pages which revolutionized the Internet.The British scientist was knighted  for his pioneering work in 2003. Sir Tim created his program while he was at the particle physics institute,Cern,in Geneva.The computer code he came up with let scientists easily share research findings across a computer network.In the early 1990s,it was called the \"world wide web,\" and is still the basis of the web as we know it. The famous man never went on to commercialize his work.Instead he worked on expanding the use of the Net as a channel for free expression and cooperation. \"The web is encouraging new types of social networks and opening up new ways for information management and business development.The web has significantly improved many people's ability to obtain information central to their lives,\"said Pekka Tarjanne,chairman of the Millennium Technology Prize award committee. Just under 80 people from 22 countries were nominated  for the prize for their work in the areas of health,communication,new materials and the environment.

{"answer": 3, "choices": ["Obeying is the best quality.", "Giving is always a pleasure.", "Appreciating others will benefit a lot.", "Dealing with relationship is important."], "question": "While working in Southeast Asia in the mid 1990's, I became a branch manager in a factory. At the beginning, I used human relations principles, such as putting myself into the others place to help gain trust. After a few months, I was told that the factory team members liked and trusted me. Then the owner, seeing how everyone thought well of me, believed that I could become an instrument of change to carry out his several unpopular programs. The factory members resisted and eventually saw me as a _ controlled by the owner. The more I insisted that they 'follow orders' the more they found ways to weaken the new changes. Finally, I was replaced by a manager who knew enough to please both masters. Even though the owner did not like the fact that his new changes were not immediately applied, the new manager gained his power by the support received from his team together with an intention to find a way. What I learned was that your team must always see you as supportive of their needs, even to the extent that the owner may not be pleased that you are unable to follow their wishes. At the end of the day, if your people do not follow you then you are no longer in charge and will be replaced. At first I blamed my boss for putting me in such a position. Then in honest reflection, I began to realize that he had probably hoped that I would have found some middle ground. What I could have done was to first obtain their advice about why they did not wish to follow the new policy changes, and then I should have used my influence with both the owner and team members to find a better way. Though, in fact it is a painful lesson for me, it has served me well along my career path! What can we learn from the passage?", "subject": ""}

As chance would have it, the policeman came from Italy and replied in the same language. After twelve hours traveling round on a bus, the driver handed him over to a second policeman. After brief argument with the policeman, Jack was very surprised to find that the Rome police had employed someone who did not speak his mother tongue.

No longer able to manage a home of her own, she moved in with my mother, where she was visited often by other members of her large, loving family. Although she still had her good days, it was often hard to arouse her interest. But one chilly December afternoon three years ago, my daughter Meagan, then eight, and I were visiting her, when she noticed that Meagan was carrying her favorite doll.\"I, too, had a special doll when I was a little girl,\" she told a wide-eyed Meagan. \"I got it one Christmas when I was about your age. I lived in an old farmhouse in Maine, with Mom, Dad and my four sisters, and the very first gift I opened that Christmas was the most beautiful doll you'd ever want to see.\" \"She had an exquisite(,), hand-painted face, and her long brown hair was pulled back with a big pink bow. Her eyes were blue, and they opened and closed.

Her lace skirt had hung down from the table just enough for my baby sister to reach up and pull on it. When I ran in, there lay my beautiful doll on the floor, her face smashed into a dozen pieces. She was gone forever.\" A few years later, GG's baby sister was also gone, she told Meagan, a victim of pneumonia . Now the tears in her eyes spilled over -- tears, I knew, not only for a lost doll and a lost sister, but for a lost time. Subdued  for the rest of the visit, Meagan was no sooner in the car going home than she exclaimed, \"Mom, I have a great idea! Let's get GG a new doll for Christmas. Then she won't cry when she thinks about it.\" My heart filled with pride as I listened to my sympathetic little daughter. But where would we find a doll to match GG's fond memories? Where there's a will, as they say, there's a way. When I told my best friends, Liz and Chris, about my problem, Liz put me in touch with a local doll-make. From a doll supply house I ordered a long brown hair and a kidskin body to copy the outfit GG had so lovingly described. Liz volunteered to put the doll together, and Chris helped me make the doll's outfit. Meagan wrote the story of the lost doll by giving examples. Finally our creation was finished. To our eyes it was perfect. But there was no way it could be exactly like the doll GG had loved so much and lost. Would she think it looked anything like it? On Christmas Eve, Meagan and I carried our happily packed gift to GG, where she sat surrounded by children, parents, aunts, uncles and cousins. \"It's for you,\" Meagan said, \"but first you have to read the story that goes with it.\" GG no sooner got through the first page than her voice cracked and she was unable to go on, but Meagan took over where she left off. Then it was time to open her present. I'll never forget the look on GG's face as she lifted the doll and held it to her chest. Once again her tears fell, but this time they were tears of joy.

No longer able to manage a home of her own, she moved in with my mother, where she was visited often by other members of her large, loving family. Although she still had her good days, it was often hard to arouse her interest. But one chilly December afternoon three years ago, my daughter Meagan, then eight, and I were visiting her, when she noticed that Meagan was carrying her favorite doll.\"I, too, had a special doll when I was a little girl,\" she told a wide-eyed Meagan. \"I got it one Christmas when I was about your age. I lived in an old farmhouse in Maine, with Mom, Dad and my four sisters, and the very first gift I opened that Christmas was the most beautiful doll you'd ever want to see.\" \"She had an exquisite(,), hand-painted face, and her long brown hair was pulled back with a big pink bow. Her eyes were blue, and they opened and closed. I remember she had a body of kidskin, and her arms and legs bent at the joints.\" GG's voice dropped low, taking on an almost respectful tone. \"My doll was dressed in a pretty pink gown, decorated with fine lace. ... _ -- my parents must have had to sacrifice so much to afford it But how happy I was that morning!\" GG's eyes filled and her voice shook with emotion as she recalled that Christmas of long ago. \"I played with my doll all morning long. And then it happened. My mother called us to the dining room for Christmas dinner and I laid my new doll down gently on the hall table. But as I went to join the family at the table, I heard a loud crash.\" \"I hardly had to turn around -- I knew it was my precious doll. And it was. Her lace skirt had hung down from the table just enough for my baby sister to reach up and pull on it. When I ran in, there lay my beautiful doll on the floor, her face smashed into a dozen pieces. She was gone forever.\" A few years later, GG's baby sister was also gone, she told Meagan, a victim of pneumonia . Now the tears in her eyes spilled over -- tears, I knew, not only for a lost doll and a lost sister, but for a lost time. Subdued  for the rest of the visit, Meagan was no sooner in the car going home than she exclaimed, \"Mom, I have a great idea! Let's get GG a new doll for Christmas. Then she won't cry when she thinks about it.\" My heart filled with pride as I listened to my sympathetic little daughter. But where would we find a doll to match GG's fond memories? Where there's a will, as they say, there's a way. When I told my best friends, Liz and Chris, about my problem, Liz put me in touch with a local doll-make. From a doll supply house I ordered a long brown hair and a kidskin body to copy the outfit GG had so lovingly described. Liz volunteered to put the doll together, and Chris helped me make the doll's outfit. Meagan wrote the story of the lost doll by giving examples. Finally our creation was finished. To our eyes it was perfect. But there was no way it could be exactly like the doll GG had loved so much and lost. Would she think it looked anything like it? On Christmas Eve, Meagan and I carried our happily packed gift to GG, where she sat surrounded by children, parents, aunts, uncles and cousins. \"It's for you,\" Meagan said, \"but first you have to read the story that goes with it.\" GG no sooner got through the first page than her voice cracked and she was unable to go on, but Meagan took over where she left off. Then it was time to open her present. I'll never forget the look on GG's face as she lifted the doll and held it to her chest. Once again her tears fell, but this time they were tears of joy. Holding the doll in her frail arms, she repeated over and over again, \"She's exactly like my old doll, exactly like her.\" And perhaps she wasn't saying that just to be kind. Perhaps however impossible it seemed, we had managed to produce a close copy of the doll she remembered. But as I watched my eight-year-old daughter and her great-grandmother examining the doll together, I thought of a likelier explanation.

I just wrote about all of my study habits in college that got me earning A's in almost every class that I took. Since then I have forwarded that email to countless friends and  s with kids heading off to school. I decided to stop cutting and pasting emails and put this advice up on a website to make it easier to send on. Inside this site are some very specific things that you can do to get an A in every college class. No magic. Just a set of college study methods and some common sense behaviors that when consistently followed will increase the likelihood of any student getting an A in any class in college. The beauty is that this is simple, common sense stuff, but it works. For example, one plus one equals two. I believe that most anxiety issues are the result of poor performance, not the cause of it. When kids are successful in college, their stress and anxiety go down and they're happy, well-adjusted and enjoying the challenges that go along with it. They aren't looking for excuses for their failure and a reason to come home. The practices you'll find in here include concrete, practical tips that anyone can apply. They will create successful, happy students who get good grades. This isn't a site that you scan through. If you want to learn how to study in college properly, you need to put down the beer and dedicate the time to read it all from start to finish. Developing good study habits takes some time, but only a fraction of the time you'll waste struggling in a just a single class. My intent is to help you make the transition to a successful, and less stressful, college experience. I include some specific, tangible study techniques and time management practices to get you doing things the right way fast. When you follow these methods, you'll have more time for the sports and parties, and you'll still get A's - I promise you that. The genre  of this article is  _  .", "subject": ""}

Sometimes Joe hit the ball straight. Sometimes it went wide again. But it seemed that the more he believed he could do it, the easier it was. \"I'm not a joke now,\" thought Joe. \"Not a joke at all!\" But a practice wasn't like a real match and his boots were still not giving him enough power. He should have told his mum and dad about it straight away but, of course, he didn't. He was always shy to ask for things. Finally, late on the night before the match, he could hold himself back no longer. \"Dad, I haven't got any proper football boots ...\" he said. \"Ah,\" said Dad, \"I might be able to help you there.\" At the words, Joe was excited. New boots! He thought. \"He's got me some new boots! He must have got me them for Christmas,\" thought Joe, \"But now that I'm in an important match, he's giving them to me early. Wonderful!\" Dad went upstairs. Joe excitedly tried to watch the football preview on TV. He wasn't playing for Manchester United or Liverpool, of course, but he was part of it all now; part of the thrill. His legs twitched with every kick on the screen. His head shook with every centre. And all the time, his mind was racing ahead to his own great game the next morning, in his super new boots. It was ages before his dad came downstairs again. He put a large pair of shiny black boots in front of Joe. As he stared at them, the boy felt as if someone had poured ice into his brain. The boots were awful! \"Good, eh?\" said his dad. Joe found it hard to speak. He had never seen anything like them before. They weren't low-cut, soft or.... They had big, hard square toes, great big long studs and they were high at the ankle. They were his dad's old rugby boots, polished up. Joe was filled with disappointment. They had been good boots, quality boots. And they were his size. Joe's feet were enormous for his age. But he could imagine what everyone at school would say. \" ...,\" he finally gasped, \" should be exactly my size.\" \"At least I won't slip,\" he thought, \"the studs are like sharks' teeth!\" Then he couldn't help thinking about those in Ashton's windows, which he had been longing to get.

So it is only natural that most moms and dads will try just about anything, including spending a lot of money -to keep an attack at bay. Trouble is, more than half of parents are trying strategies that simply do not work and wasting hundreds of dollars in the process. According to Dr. Machael Cabana, a pediatrician at the prefix = st1 /UniversityofMichigan's C.S.

Many of those parents then neglected to do what would have helped a lot more; shut the windows to keep pollen out. Another was using a humidifier for a child who was allergic to dust mites; a humidifier tends to be a place where dust mites like to breed. With those allergies, a dehumidifier works better. Worst of all was the number of smokers with asthmatic children who didn't even try to quit or at least limit themselves to smoking outdoors rather than just moving to another room or the garage. Many smoking parents purchased expensive air filters that have what Cabana called \" questionable utility. \" Part of the problem, Dr. Caban and his colleagues believe, is that parents are bombarded by television ads that encourage them to buy products such as air and carpet fresheners, ionizers and other remedies that are often expensive but medically unnecessary. And doctors may not always take the time, or have the time, to explain to parents what will and won't work in their child's particular case. For example, allergies are usually a problem for older children with asthma, while kids 5 and younger more frequently have trouble with viral repiratory infections.

She had grown up in a home where she was constantly criticized and often treated unfairly by her parents. As a result, she was negative and fearful, and had no confidence at all. One day, she was hit by a car. When she awoke, she found herself in a hospital. She could still speak, but had no recollection of any part of her past life. She was a total amnesiac! Her husband and children visited her daily, but she did not know them. Determined to understand what had happened to her, she began reading medical textbooks and studying in the specialized area of amnesia and memory loss. She met and discussed with specialists in this field. Eventually she wrote a paper on her condition. Not long afterward, she was invited to address a medical conference to deliver her paper, answer questions about her amnesia, and share her experiences and ideas. During this period, something amazing happened. She became a genuinely positive, confident, outgoing woman, well informed, and very much in demand as a speaker and authority in the medical profession. All memory of her negative childhood had been wiped out. She changed her thinking and changed her life. Each person comes into the world with no thoughts or ideas at all, and everything that a person thinks and feels is learned from babyhood onward. The adult becomes the sum total of everything he or she learns, feels, and experiences while growing up. Everyone is born with no self-concept at all. Every idea, opinion, feeling, attitude, or value you have as an adult is the result of an idea or impression you took in and accepted as true. When you believe something to be true, it becomes true for you, whatever the fact may be. You are not what you think you are, but what you think, you are.

{"answer": 1, "choices": ["annoyed", "depressed", "stressed", "encouraged"], "question": "Many everyday American expressions are based on colors. Red is a hot color. Americans often use it to express heat. They may say they are red hot about something unfair. When they are red hot they are very angry about something. The small hot tasting peppers found in many Mexican foods are called red hots for their color and their fiery taste. Pink is a lighter kind of color. People sometimes say they are in the pink when they are in good health. It probably comes from the fact that many babies are born with a nice pink color that shows that they are in good health. Blue is a cool color. The traditional blues music in the United States is the opposite of red hot music. Blues is slow, sad and soulful. Someone who is blue is very sad. The color green is natural for trees and grass. But it is an unnatural color for humans. A person who has a sick stomach may say he feels a little green.

{"answer": 2, "choices": ["consumers don't care where to buy them", "consumers spend much time searching for", "satisfy similar needs of the consumer", "can be found in nearly every shop"], "question": "The traditional distinction between products that satisfy needs and those that satisfy wants is no longer adequate to describe classes of products. In today's prosperous societies, the distinction has become unclear because so many wants have been turned into needs. A writer, for instance, can work with paper and pencils. These are legal needs for the task. But the work can be done more quickly and efficiently with a word processor. Thus a computer is soon viewed as a need rather than a want. In the field of marketing, consumer goods are classed according to the way in which they are purchased. The two main classes are convenience goods and shopping goods. Two lesser types are specialty goods and unsought  goods. It must be emphasized that all of these types are based on the way shoppers think about products, not on the nature of the products themselves. What is regarded as a convenience item in France (wine, for example) should be a specialty goods in the United States. People do not spend a great deal of time shopping for such convenience items as groceries, newspapers, toothpaste, aspirin, and candy. The buying of convenience goods may be done routinely, as some families buy groceries once a week. Such regularly purchased items are called staples. Sometimes convenience products are bought without enough thinking; someone has a sudden desire for an ice cream sundae  on a hot day. Or they may be purchased as emergency items. Shopping goods are items for which customers search. They compare prices, quality, and styles, and may visit a number of stores before making a decision. Buying an automobile is often done this way. Shopping goods fall into two classes; those that are recognized as basically the same and those that are regarded as different. Items that are looked upon as basically the same include such things as home appliances, television sets, and automobiles. Having decided on the model desired, the customer is primarily interested in getting the item at the most favorable price. Items regarded as essentially different include clothing, furniture, and dishes. Quality, style and fashion will either take precedence  over price, or they will not matter at all. Shopping goods that are considered as basically the same are those that   _  .", "subject": ""}

Surfman Theodore Meekins was on watch that evening of 11 October 1896. A hurricane had struck the Outer Banks of North Carolina, and the tide was so strong that beach patrols had been canceled. Still, Meekins paid close attention to the horizon. This was the type of weather that could blow ships hundreds of miles off course. Offshore, the ship E.S. Newman was caught in the storm. The captain, whose wife and child were on the ship, feared the Newman would soon break up. He made the decision to beach his ship, then fired a signal, praying that someone onshore would see it. Meekins, whose eyes were trained to cut through rain and surf mists, thought he saw the signal, but so much spray   covered the lookout windows that he could hardly make sure. Still, he took no chances. After summoning   the station keeper, Captain Richard Etheridge, Meekins set off a coston signal, a signal made by using lamps of different colors. Together, the two men searched the darkness for a reply. A few moments later, they saw a flash of light to the south and knew a shop was in distress  . Even before the return signal burned out, Etheridge had summoned his men and begun rescue operations. For the lifesavers, the rescue of the Newman was nothing unusual. Over the years, so many ships had off the Outer Banks that sailors called the region the Graveyard of the Atlantic. Noting the dangerous surf and wind conditions, Captain Etheridge quickly decided the surf boats would be impossible to control. Instead, he decided to use another way to help the survivors. The crew set off on the long journey down the beach to the scene of the wreck  . Captain Etheridge hoped to fire a line from a gun to the ship's mast  . After the ship's crew dragged the line onboard, the surfmen would fire a second line and carry survivors safely to shore. The surfmen crossed three miles of sand to reach the ship Newman. The water was freezing, and the men often sank up to their knees in sand. Captain Etheridge noted in his diary that \"the voice of gladdened hearts greeted the arrival of the station crew,\" but that \"it seemed impossible for them to do anything under such circumstances. The work was often stopped by the sweeping current.\" Even when the rescue equipment proved useless, Etheridge refused to give up. Choosing two of his strongest surfmen, he tied rope lines around their waists and sent them into the water. The two men, holding a line from shore, walked with huge effort as far as they could before diving through the waves. Nearly worn out while swimming against the tide, they finally made it to the shore. The first to be rescued were the captain's wife and child. With the two passengers tied to their backs, the surfmen fought their way back to shore. Taking turns, Etheridge and his crew made ten trips to the Newman, saving every person onboard. It was 1:00 a.m. when the crew and survivors finally made it back to the station. That night, as the exhausted survivors lay sleeping and his lifesaving crew rested, Captain Etheridge picked up his pen, and in the light of an oil lantern, wrote with satisfaction that all the people onboard had been saved and were \"sheltered in this station\"--words he would remember for many years to come.

After the ship's crew dragged the line onboard, the surfmen would fire a second line and carry survivors safely to shore. The surfmen crossed three miles of sand to reach the ship Newman. The water was freezing, and the men often sank up to their knees in sand. Captain Etheridge noted in his diary that \"the voice of gladdened hearts greeted the arrival of the station crew,\" but that \"it seemed impossible for them to do anything under such circumstances. The work was often stopped by the sweeping current.\" Even when the rescue equipment proved useless, Etheridge refused to give up. Choosing two of his strongest surfmen, he tied rope lines around their waists and sent them into the water. The two men, holding a line from shore, walked with huge effort as far as they could before diving through the waves. Nearly worn out while swimming against the tide, they finally made it to the shore. The first to be rescued were the captain's wife and child. With the two passengers tied to their backs, the surfmen fought their way back to shore. Taking turns, Etheridge and his crew made ten trips to the Newman, saving every person onboard. It was 1:00 a.m. when the crew and survivors finally made it back to the station. That night, as the exhausted survivors lay sleeping and his lifesaving crew rested, Captain Etheridge picked up his pen, and in the light of an oil lantern, wrote with satisfaction that all the people onboard had been saved and were \"sheltered in this station\"--words he would remember for many years to come.

Surfman Theodore Meekins was on watch that evening of 11 October 1896. A hurricane had struck the Outer Banks of North Carolina, and the tide was so strong that beach patrols had been canceled. Still, Meekins paid close attention to the horizon. This was the type of weather that could blow ships hundreds of miles off course. Offshore, the ship E.S. Newman was caught in the storm. The captain, whose wife and child were on the ship, feared the Newman would soon break up. He made the decision to beach his ship, then fired a signal, praying that someone onshore would see it. Meekins, whose eyes were trained to cut through rain and surf mists, thought he saw the signal, but so much spray   covered the lookout windows that he could hardly make sure. Still, he took no chances. After summoning   the station keeper, Captain Richard Etheridge, Meekins set off a coston signal, a signal made by using lamps of different colors. Together, the two men searched the darkness for a reply. A few moments later, they saw a flash of light to the south and knew a shop was in distress  . Even before the return signal burned out, Etheridge had summoned his men and begun rescue operations. For the lifesavers, the rescue of the Newman was nothing unusual. Over the years, so many ships had off the Outer Banks that sailors called the region the Graveyard of the Atlantic.

He said yes! Here are our questions and Greg's answers from space. What's the best thing about being in space? Zero-gravity  is by far the best thing about being in space. It does not really mean that there is no gravity. It means that we are moving around Earth in the same way the space station is moving around Earth. So we are floating inside the space station. We travel around Earth once every 90 minutes. That's 16 sunrises and sunsets every day. Really fast! Inside the station, we can fly around like superman. It's an amazing feeling, and I hope everyone gets a chance to fly in space someday to experience the wonder of zero-gravity. What do you do for fun in the space shuttle? There are so many things you can do in zero-gravity that are fun. Flying around is fun. Eating food that floats is fun. I like to play like Superman and see how far I can fly without touching any walls. Another fun thing is to play with water. Most of all, the most exciting thing to do is to look out the window at our beautiful planet Earth below. You never get tired of seeing it like that, the way it really is and it can never be seen that way while standing on its surface. What's the coolest thing about being on a spacewalk? Wow! Doing a spacewalk is cool. There is nothing more wonderful than floating in space in your own space suit. It's amazing, and when you are doing a spacewalk, you are \"out there\" just floating in empty space, like the earth, like the moon, like the sun, like the space station. It's not science fiction.

The story goes like this:the more consumers spend,the more money circulates in the economy, which contributes to healthy job growth and profits. Keynes, a British economist,went as far as to say that individuals saving their money may actually be hurting the economy. Sounds troubling, doesn't it? Fear not.

In fact,economic activity should not be mistaken for economic growth. For example,somebody takes their money, walks into a store, and purchases goods. The store increases its _ . But what happens to all of those goods and services that people have chosen not to consume by saving their money? Simple:Other people are allowed to consume them. Think of it this way:When you lend out your savings, you are actually saying,\"Here, I am not going to consume right now, so why don't you?\" Banks simply play the middleman:they collect lots of people's savings and then lend out lots of funds. It takes an unbelievable amount of goods and services to construct a building. It takes food, shelter, and entertainment for all of the workers, as well. Without savings,it is quite impossible to finance such a construction. The coordination between savings and consumption is a necessary basis for sound economic growth. This coordination is also why consumer lending (say , to borrow a big sum of money to buy a car) is not productive,in a strict sense. It doesn't increase the net   amount of wealth of an economy. Those savings could have been used to construct, say, factory equipment. None of this means consumption and spending are \"bad\" things. They simply do not make us wealthier. After all, the final goal of production and savings is to consume. But to say that consumption is the engine of economic growth is to put the cart before the horse.

Think of it this way:When you lend out your savings, you are actually saying,\"Here, I am not going to consume right now, so why don't you?\" Banks simply play the middleman:they collect lots of people's savings and then lend out lots of funds. It takes an unbelievable amount of goods and services to construct a building. It takes food, shelter, and entertainment for all of the workers, as well. Without savings,it is quite impossible to finance such a construction. The coordination between savings and consumption is a necessary basis for sound economic growth. This coordination is also why consumer lending (say , to borrow a big sum of money to buy a car) is not productive,in a strict sense. It doesn't increase the net   amount of wealth of an economy. Those savings could have been used to construct, say, factory equipment. None of this means consumption and spending are \"bad\" things. They simply do not make us wealthier. After all, the final goal of production and savings is to consume. But to say that consumption is the engine of economic growth is to put the cart before the horse. Or, to rephrase: the consumption of wealth can never make you wealthier. Happier, perhaps. Wealthier, no. What would be the best title for this passage?", "subject": ""}

Previous attempts to teach chimpanzees  to talk had ended in failure and the matter was considered by most people to be closed. But the Gardens realized that speech and the language are not the same thing. Many deaf people, for example, are unable to speak but are perfectly able to communicate by gestures that have all the features of spoken language. The Garders suspected that previous experiments had failed because chimpanzees are physically unable to speak.    They therefore decided to try teaching a chimpanzee to sign in the way that deaf people do. And their chosen  _ , a female chimpanzee named Washoe after the country in which the university is, proved to be a skillful pupil. Though there is still debate about whether what Washoe learned was really equal to human language, there is no doubt that she learned a lot of words. All of this, however, raises a second question. If Washoe can learn a complex vocabulary of gestures from people, do they have such vocabularies naturally ? To examine that possibility, Amy Pollick and Frans de Waal of Emory University have looked at gestures and expressions in chimpanzees,    Signaling by facial and oral expressions is common among primates  . Signaling by gestures is limited to great apes. The researchers supposed that the meaning of expressions has been fixed by evolution while the meaning of gestures is learnt. If that were true, particular sorts of facial and oral expressions would occur only in particular circumstances, and this would be the same across groups and even species. The same gestures, on the contrary, would be used in different circumstances. The researchers found exactly what they expected. Expressions almost always occurred in the same circumstances in different groups and different species. Gestures seemed to have completely different meanings. Moreover, even within a single group,the meaning of a gesture could vary with circumstances. It's also worth remembering that gesture is still an essential part of human language, even for those with normal hearing. The old joke that the way to make an Italian speechless is to tie his hands together has much truth in it. Evolution does not come up with complex structures in a single leap. They are built up step by step.

In this age of visual and aural hyper-stimulation, the medium of radio is making a great comeback. \"We're at the beginning of a golden age of audio,\" said US-based podcaster Alex Blumberg in an article in The Sydney Morning Herald. In the last month alone, 15 percent of US adults listened to a radio podcast  . These statistics, released by Edison Research, show the successful evolution of traditional radio broadcasts to the present day's digital podcast format. The term \"podcast\" was invented in 2004, but the trend only started gaining mainstream popularity in recent years. With the sharp increase in consumer demand for smartphones and tablets, podcast sales have jumped. The appeal of the podcast partly lies in its multiplatform delivery and on-demand capabilities  . You can listen during those extra minutes of the day when you're walking to the shops, waiting in a queue or riding the subway. Similar to television shows, podcasts are generally free to download and most offer new content every week. Donna Jackson, 22, Sydney University media graduate, listens to podcasts two or three times a week, via iTune. \"I listen while I'm wandering around the house doing something else. It makes completing a boring task much more enjoyable... And it's an easy way of keeping in touch with what's going on in the rest of the world,\" she said, \"I mainly listen to BBC podcasts, but recently I've also been listening to This American Life and Serial.

In this age of visual and aural hyper-stimulation, the medium of radio is making a great comeback. \"We're at the beginning of a golden age of audio,\" said US-based podcaster Alex Blumberg in an article in The Sydney Morning Herald. In the last month alone, 15 percent of US adults listened to a radio podcast  . These statistics, released by Edison Research, show the successful evolution of traditional radio broadcasts to the present day's digital podcast format. The term \"podcast\" was invented in 2004, but the trend only started gaining mainstream popularity in recent years. With the sharp increase in consumer demand for smartphones and tablets, podcast sales have jumped. The appeal of the podcast partly lies in its multiplatform delivery and on-demand capabilities  . You can listen during those extra minutes of the day when you're walking to the shops, waiting in a queue or riding the subway. Similar to television shows, podcasts are generally free to download and most offer new content every week. Donna Jackson, 22, Sydney University media graduate, listens to podcasts two or three times a week, via iTune. \"I listen while I'm wandering around the house doing something else. It makes completing a boring task much more enjoyable... And it's an easy way of keeping in touch with what's going on in the rest of the world,\" she said, \"I mainly listen to BBC podcasts, but recently I've also been listening to This American Life and Serial.

Emotional reactions as well as logical thought processes affect the behavior of most people. \"The burnt child fears the fire\" is one instance; another is the rise of figures like Hitler. Both these examples point up the fact that attitudes come from experience. In the one case the experience was direct and impressive; in the other it was indirect and gradual. The classroom teacher in the elementary school is in strategic position to influence attitudes. This is true partly because children acquire attitudes from those adults whose word they respect. Another reason it is true is that pupils often search somewhat deeply into a subject in school that has only been touched upon at home or has possibly never occurred to them before. To a child who has previously acquire little knowledge of Mexico, his teacher's method of handling such a unit would greatly affect his attitude toward Mexicans. The teacher can develop proper attitudes through social studies, science matters, the very atmosphere of the classroom, etc. However, when children come to school with undesirable attitudes, it is unwise to attempt to change their feelings by criticizing them. The teacher can achieve the proper effect by helping them obtain constructive experience. To illustrate, first-grade pupils, afraid of policemen will probably change their attitudes after a classroom talk with the neighborhood officer in which he explains how he protects them. In the same way, a class of older children can develop attitudes through discussion, research, outside reading and all-day trips. Finally, a teacher must constantly evaluate her own attitudes, because her influence can be harmful she has personal prejudices.

By intelligence we mean a way of living and behaving, especially in a new or anxious situation. If we want to test intelligence, we need to find out how a person acts instead of how much he knows what to do. For example, when in a new situation, an intelligent person thinks about the situation, not about himself or what might happen to him. He tries to find out all he can, and then he acts immediately and tries to do something about it. He probably isn't sure how it will all work out, but at least he tries. And, if he can't make things work out right, he doesn't feel ashamed that he fails; he just tries to learn from his mistakes. An intelligent person, even if he is very young, has a special outlook  on life, special feeling about life, and knows how he fits into it. If you look at children, you'll see great difference between what we call \"bright\" children and \"not bright\" children. They are actually two different kinds of people, not just the same kind with different amounts of intelligence. For example, the bright child really wants to find out more about life --- he tries to get in touch with everything around him.

It was very important that her house should remain at all things clean and tidy. You could turn your back for a moment in my mother's house, leave a half written letter on the dining room table, a magazine open on the chair, and turn around to find that my mother had \"put it back where it belonged.\" as she explained. My wife, on one of her first visits to my mother's house, placed a packet of biscuits on an end table and went to the kitchen to fetch a drink. When she returned, she found the packet had been removed. Confused  , she set down her drink and went back to the kitchen for more biscuits, only to return to find that her drink had disappeared. Up to then she had guessed that everyone in my family held onto their drinks, so as not to make water rings on the end tables. Now she knows better.

Mr. Engelman says the population in countries that lack water is growing faster than in other parts of the world. He says population growth in these countries will continue to increase. The report says lack of water in the future may result in several problems. It may increase health problems. Lack of water often means drinking waters not safe. Mr. Engelman says there are problems all over the world because of diseases, such as cholera, which are carried in water. Lack of water may also result in more international conflict.

The shrinkage of the ice has other consequences for polar bears. They are losing their natural prey , who are also affected by the shrinkage in habitat. Land animals also do not provide the high-fat diet that polar bears need, which will lead to starvation.

Whether he's standing in front of a lecture hall or engaged in a casual conversation, his hands are always waving and pointing. When he was in graduate school, one of his professors was so annoyed by this constant gesturing that he made the young economist sit on his hands whenever he visited the professor's office. It turns out, however, that Mishkin's professor had it exactly wrong. Gesture doesn't prevent but promotes clear thought and speech. Research demonstrates that the movements we make with our hands when we talk form a kind of second language, adding information that's absent from our words. It's learning's secret code: Gesture reveals what we know. It reveals what we don't know. What's more, the agreement (or lack of agreement) between what our voices say and how our hands move offers a clue to our readiness to learn. Many of the studies establishing the importance of gesture to learning have been conducted by Susan Goldin-Meadow, a professor of psychology at the University of Chicago. \"We change our minds by moving our hands,\" writes Goldin-Meadow in a review of this work. Particularly significant are what she calls \"mismatches\" between oral expression and physical gestures. A student might say that a heavier ball falls faster than a light one, for example, but make a gesture indicating that they fall at the same rate, which is correct. Such differences indicate that we're moving from one level of understanding to another. The thoughts expressed by hand motions are often our newest and most advanced ideas about the problem we're working on; we can't yet absorb these concepts into language, but we can capture them in movement.       Goldin-Meadow's more recent work strews not only that gesture shows our readiness to learn, but that it actually helps to bring learning about. It does so in two ways. First, it elicits   helpful behavior from others around us. Goldin-Meadow has found that adults respond to children's speech-gesture mismatches by adjusting their way of instruction. Parents and teachers apparently receive the signal that children are ready to learn, and they act on it by offering a greater variety of problem-solving techniques. The act of gesturing itself also seems to quicken learning, bringing new knowledge into consciousness and aiding the understanding of new concepts. A 2007 study by Susan Wagner Cook, an assistant professor of psychology at the University of Iowa, reported that third-graders who were asked to gesture while learning algebra   were nearly three times more likely to remember what they'd learned than classmates who did not gesture.

{"answer": 3, "choices": ["Hand Motions, a Second Language", "Gesturing: Signal of Understanding", "New Uses of Gesturing", "The Secret Code of Learning"], "question": "Frederic Mishkin, who's been a professor at Columbia Business School for almost 30 years, is good at solving problems and expressing ideas. Whether he's standing in front of a lecture hall or engaged in a casual conversation, his hands are always waving and pointing. When he was in graduate school, one of his professors was so annoyed by this constant gesturing that he made the young economist sit on his hands whenever he visited the professor's office. It turns out, however, that Mishkin's professor had it exactly wrong. Gesture doesn't prevent but promotes clear thought and speech. Research demonstrates that the movements we make with our hands when we talk form a kind of second language, adding information that's absent from our words. It's learning's secret code: Gesture reveals what we know. It reveals what we don't know. What's more, the agreement (or lack of agreement) between what our voices say and how our hands move offers a clue to our readiness to learn. Many of the studies establishing the importance of gesture to learning have been conducted by Susan Goldin-Meadow, a professor of psychology at the University of Chicago. \"We change our minds by moving our hands,\" writes Goldin-Meadow in a review of this work. Particularly significant are what she calls \"mismatches\" between oral expression and physical gestures. A student might say that a heavier ball falls faster than a light one, for example, but make a gesture indicating that they fall at the same rate, which is correct. Such differences indicate that we're moving from one level of understanding to another. The thoughts expressed by hand motions are often our newest and most advanced ideas about the problem we're working on; we can't yet absorb these concepts into language, but we can capture them in movement.       Goldin-Meadow's more recent work strews not only that gesture shows our readiness to learn, but that it actually helps to bring learning about. It does so in two ways. First, it elicits   helpful behavior from others around us. Goldin-Meadow has found that adults respond to children's speech-gesture mismatches by adjusting their way of instruction. Parents and teachers apparently receive the signal that children are ready to learn, and they act on it by offering a greater variety of problem-solving techniques. The act of gesturing itself also seems to quicken learning, bringing new knowledge into consciousness and aiding the understanding of new concepts. A 2007 study by Susan Wagner Cook, an assistant professor of psychology at the University of Iowa, reported that third-graders who were asked to gesture while learning algebra   were nearly three times more likely to remember what they'd learned than classmates who did not gesture.

I looked up to thank her, but she was gone. I sat stunned, not sure what had just happened and then I looked over at my wife. In almost unison, we broke out into a smile. The sadness of the day had been wiped out by the crippled hand and generous touch of the old lady. The dollar, although exciting to Molly, was not what made us smile; it was the offer from the old lady, who felt our suffering.

{"answer": 1, "choices": ["A girl with cancer", "A touch of heaven", "A crippled hand", "A kind-hearted couple"], "question": "It had been a very disheartening day. The doctors had given us the worst of news. Our daughter, who had just completed her first brain surgery to remove a tumor   and was going through radiation treatment, was now officially given a two percent chance of survival as this type of cancer had no cure.        My wife and I decided to take our daughter to lunch before continuing our afternoon conversation. We went to a local restaurant where we sat in silence waiting for the waitress. I noticed a very elderly couple sitting a few booths away, who were also in silence and did not speak a word. I couldn't help but wonder what challenges they had faced in their life and if they ever faced such terrible news about a child of theirs.        We eventually ordered our lunch and still sitting in silence we ate what we could. At some point I became intrigued by the old couple. I thought to myself that they hadn't yet spoken to each other and I wondered if it was the peace they were enjoying or the food or maybe both. However, at some point I lost interest and put my focus back on my lunch.        Molly was still talking away and enjoying her meal. Her mom and I both listened and tried to be happy in her presence but it wasn't going very well. All of a sudden I saw a hand come out of nowhere. It was huge and I could tell that it had been afflicted with arthritis  . I couldn't take my eyes off that hand. It landed on my daughter's tiny six-year-old hand and as it did I looked up; it was the old woman who had been sitting with the old man in silence eating their lunch.        I looked into her eyes and she spoke, but not to me. She looked at my daughter and simply whispered, \"If I could do more for you I would...\" and then she smiled and moved away to join her husband, who had moved towards the door.        \"Look, a whole dollar,\" Molly spoke with excitement as she discovered a crumpled one dollar bill left behind by the old lady.

{"answer": 3, "choices": ["do not believe the drawings are old.", "believe they are allowed to paint there", "think the drawings should be left alone", "think the drawings will not disappear"], "question": "Tens of thousands of ancient pictures carved into the rocks at one of France's most important tourist sites are being gradually destroyed. Scientists and researchers fear that the 36,000 drawings on rocks in Mont Bego in the French Alps are being damaged so rapidly that they will not survive for future generations. The mountain, believed to have once been a site for prayer, is scattered   with 4,000-year-old drawings cut into bare rock. They include pictures of cows with horns, cultivated fields   and various gods and goddesses. But as the popularity of the site increases, the pictures are being ruined by thoughtless graffiti  . Jean Clottes is the chairman of the International Committee on Rock Art. He says, \"People think that because the pictures have been there so long they will always continue to be there. But if the damage continues at this rate there will be nothing left in 50 years.\" He describes seeing tourists stamping on the drawings, wearing away the rock and definition   of the artwork as they do so. Some visitors, he says, even cut off parts to take home as souvenirs. \"When people think they can't take a good enough photograph, they rub the drawings to get a clearer picture,\" he said. \"The drawings are polished by the weather, and if the sun is shining and the visitors can't see them properly they simply rub them to make them look fresher.\" Other researchers describe how people arrive carrying long sticks with sharp ends to scratch   their own drawings, or even their names, in the rocks. But experts are divided over the best way to preserve the drawings. Henry de Lumley, director of the Museum of Natural History in Paris, believes that the only way to save the site is to turn the whole mountain into a \"no-go\" area, preventing the public from going there except on guided tours. Otherwise, he says, not only will the site be completely destroyed but important research work will be reduced. Clottes disagrees, \"The measure suggested by Henry de Lumley is the most severe, and while it is the most effective, it is also certain to bring about protests from people who live there,\" he said. \"The site was classified as a historic monument years ago by the Ministry of Culture, and we must do as much as possible to save what is there.\" David Lavergne, the regional architect, also wants to avoid closing the site. \"Henry de Lumley's idea isn't ideal,\" he said. \"Our department feels that the best solution is to let people look at the site, but because the area is very big it is difficult to prevent visitors from damaging it. I would prefer that everyone was able to look at it, but the main problem is money. We do not have the funds to employ the necessary number of guards. We may have to consider charging a fee. It doesn't seem to be possible to get the government support.\" In Nice, Annie Echassoux, who also worked on researching the site, is alarmed that as the mountain becomes easier to reach -- tourists can now avoid the three-and-a-half-hour walk by hiring vehicles -- the damage will increase rapidly. She thinks that the only solution is to rope off the area and provide guides. \"You can't say the plan can't go ahead because there is no money,\" she said. \"That is not good enough.

Sian Beilock, a psychology professor at the University of Chicago in Illinois, has studied these highly anxious test-takers. Sian Beilock says: \"They start worrying about the consequences. They might even start worrying about whether this exam is going to prevent them from getting into the college they want. And when they worry, it actually uses up attention and memory resources. I talk about _ as their cognitive horsepower that they could otherwise be using to focus on the exam.\" Professor Beilock and another researcher, Gerardo Ramirez, have developed a possible solution. Just before an exam, highly anxious test-takers spend ten minutes writing about their worries about the test. The researchers tested the idea on a group of 20 anxious college students. They gave them two short math tests. After the first one, they asked the students to either sit quietly or write about their feelings about the upcoming second test. The researchers added to the pressure. They told the students that those who did well on the second test would get money. They also told them that their performance would affect other students as part of a team effort. Professor Beilock says those who sat quietly scored an average of 12 percent worse on the second test. But the students who had written about their fears improved their performance by an average of five percent. Next, the researchers used younger students in a biology class. They told them before final exams either to write about their feelings or to think about things unrelated to the test. Professor Beilock says highly anxious students who did the writing got an average grade of B+, compared to a B-for those who did not. The research shows that for students who are highly test-anxious, who'd done the writing intervention , all of a sudden there was no relationship between test anxiety and performance. Those students most likely to worry were performing just as well as their classmates who don't normally get nervous in these testing situations.
