{"answer": 1, "choices": ["Eat better, live better", "Feel better, live longer", "Less stress, fewer diseases", "Smoke more, age sooner"], "question": "Life is to be enjoyed. There's no point in giving up something you enjoy unless you get something back that's even better. When people eat more healthfully, exercise, quit smoking, and manage stress better, they find that they feel so much better that it reconstructs the reason for making these changes from fear of dying to joy of living. The latest studies show that when you exercise and eat right: YOUR BRAIN receives more blood flow and oxygen, so you become smarter, think more clearly, have more energy, and need less sleep. Two studies showed that just walking for three hours per week for only three months caused so many new neurons   to grow that it actually increased the size of people's brains! YOUR FACE receives more blood flow, so your skin glows more and wrinkles less. You look younger and more attractive. In contrast, an unhealthy diet, chronic emotional stress and smoking reduce blood flow to your face so you age more quickly. Smoking accelerates aging because nicotine causes your arteries   to narrow down, which decreases blood flow to your face and makes it wrinkle earlier. This is why smokers look years older than they really are. YOUR GENES change. In May, a study was published in the Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences showing that changing your lifestyle changes your genes. YOUR TELOMERES   get longer. Telomeres are the ends of our chromosomes   that control how long we live. As telomeres become shorter, then cells age more quickly, thus shortening your life. Besides, one of the most interesting findings in the study was that the mothers' awareness of stress was more important than what was really occurring in their lives. The researchers gave the women a questionnaire and asked them to rate on a three-point scale how stressed they felt each day, and how out of control their lives felt to them. The women who were aware that they were under heavy stress had significantly shortened and damaged telomeres compared with those who felt more relaxed. On the contrary, some of the women who felt relaxed despite raising a disabled child had more normal-appearing telomeres. In other words, if you feel stressed, you are stressed; if you feel fine, you are fine. The best title for the passage would be   _  .", "subject": ""}

{"answer": 3, "choices": ["Americans are used to travelling by cars", "American public transportation is growing worse", "American car industry caused disastrous road accidents", "American people's health is threatened by automobiles"], "question": "Three Yale University professors agreed in a discussion that the automobile was what one of them called \"Public Health Enemy No. 1 in this century\". Besides polluting the air and overcrowding the cities, cars are involved in more than half the disastrous accidents, and they contribute to heart disease \"because we won't walk anywhere any more,\" said Richard Weeinaman, professor of medicine and public health. Speaking of many of those man-made dangers of the automobile, Arthur W. Galson, professor of biology, said it was possible to make a kerosene-burning turbine car that would \"lessensmog by a very large factor\". But he expressed doubt whether Americans were willing to give up moving about the countryside at 90 miles per hour in a large vehicle. \"America seems wedded to the motor car--every family has to have at least two, and one has to be a convertible   with 300 horsepower,\" professor Galson continued. \"Is this the way of life that we choose because we treasure these values?\" For professor Sears, part of the blame lies with \"a society that regards profit as a supreme value, under the illusion that anything that's technically possible is, therefore, morally justified\". Professor Sears also called the country's dependence on its modern automobiles \"terrible economics\" because of the large horsepower used simply \"moving one individual to work\". But he admitted that Americans have painted themselves into a corner by allowing the national economy to become so dependent on the automobile industry. \"The solution,\" Dr Weeinerman said, \"is not finding a less dangerous fuel but a different system of inner city transportation.

Yoga started in India more than 5,000 years ago.The name means \"to join together\".That is to bring the body and mind together into one pleasing experience.The whole system of yoga is built on three things:exercise,breathing and meditation  . The yoga that we know today is mostly physical yoga.It's seen as a type of exercise,but is different from sports like football or running.When we do yoga,we move our body into positions that stretch the muscles and joints,making them stronger. One of the best things about yoga is the fact that everyone can do it.To women,it means a flat stomach,more shapely legs and a graceful body.To men,it is a way of becoming stronger and more athletic. There are also speciallydesigned yoga classes for pregnant women or children suffering from mental disabilities,such as autism  .As for teenagers,meditation and simple breathing exercises can help them learn to calm down,relax and concentrate better.But teenagers under  16  are  not supposed to do the body exercises as it could have a bad effect on their natural growth. According to the passage,who does not need to pay special attention in practising yoga?", "subject": ""}

In addition, people have developed cultural patterns and technologies that help them adjust to extremes of temperature and humidity . In very cold climates, there is a constant danger of developing hypothermia , which is a life threatening drop in core body temperature to below normal levels. The normal temperature for humans is about 37.0degC. However, differences in persons and even the time of day can cause it to be as much as 6degC higher or lower in healthy individuals. It is also normal for core body temperature to be lower in elderly people. Hypothermia begins to occur when the core body temperature drops to 34.4degC. Below 29.4degC, the body cools more rapidly because its natural temperature regulating system usually fails. The rapid decline in core body temperature is likely to result in death. However, there have been rare cases in which people have been saved after their temperatures had dropped to 13.9-15.6degC. This happened in 1999 to a Swedish woman who was trapped under an ice sheet in freezing water for 80 minutes. She was found unconscious, not breathing, and her heart had stopped beating, yet she was eventually saved despite the fact that her temperature had dropped to 13.7degC.

Suddenly, I recalled my mother hanging laundry on a clothesline during my childhood. My sister and I had played hide-and-seek among the sweet-smelling sheets waving in the wind. I suddenly had a plan. After the wash cycle, we covered the maples with damp blue jeans, shirts, socks and towels. The only things that didn't go outside were my underpants. And I persuaded my shameless husband to let his big boxer shorts  stay indoors, too. There is a secret pleasure to hanging laundry outdoors. It is the perfect excuse to get up from the computer. While checking on the laundry in the backyard, I could commune  not only with cotton T-shirts, but also my cats. I could watch cautious deer run through the yard with their young, listen to nervous squirrels in trees and observe a family of wild turkeys by the road. I returned to my desk refreshed. And, except for the sandpaper feel of sun-dried bath towels, the drying method was a complete success. When autumn came, I'd scan the horizon each day to evaluate the chances of sun-drying. One morning I saw rain clouds. I had a load of wet clothes in my arms and no place to put them. I found my husband. Together we hung laundry throughout the house. Then my husband gave me a hug and a smile. \"I think it's time to buy a dryer...\" he said, \"... like, today.\" \"Good idea,\" I said, just as the infamous Oregon rain started. Our sun-dried laundry habit was finished for the season. Which of the following is TRUE according to the article?", "subject": ""}
{"answer": 1, "choices": ["are rare before 2001", "seem extremely worrying", "cause kids to lose interest in sports", "are mostly caused by wearing no helmets"], "question": "In many sports, physical contact  is part of the game. But when athletes hit their heads, the hit can cause concussions . Concussions have long been a concern for professional athletes, but they've become more common among young players too. Between 2001 and 2009, the number of kids under 19 visiting doctors for concussions each year increased by 62 percent. Engineers are developing new helmets , and new rules are limiting physical contact in some sports. But are these efforts enough to protect kids' brains? Concussions can happen during many types of activities. But sports like football and soccer are especially risky. When you run or jump, your body is moving at an increased speed. A sudden hit causes you to move faster in a different direction. \"It's like when you're in a bus and it makes a sudden stop,\" says Dr. Kevin Crutchfield, an expert at a sports concussion center in Baltimore, Maryland. \"You hit the inside of the bus.\" This hit damages the brain. It affects the way the brain functions. So some sports require athletes to wear helmets. Helmets help reduce the force of a hit. The hard outer shell spreads the force of larger area. Inside a helmet, a plastic or air-filled lining also helps soften the blow. Steve Rowson is an engineer at Virginia Tech. In his lab, he tests how helmets hold up against different types of hits. No helmet can prevent concussions completely, says Rowson. But he's found that when wearing a newer football helmet, the player's head doesn't gain speed as much after a hit. That lowers the risk of concussions. Many youth sports teams have set limits on physical contact to reduce the risk of concussions. In soccer, most concussions happen as a result of headers--shots or passes made with the head. That's why many people think kids shouldn't head the ball until high school. These efforts should help, says Crutchfield.

Forty years later, Special English continues to communicate with people who are not fluent in English. But during the years its role has expanded. It also helps people learn American English.

I used to think that people who watched birds were strange, but this summer I found myself watching them, and maybe I'll get a book on the subject. I feel a strong desire for a religious belief that I never thought I'd want, and echo   my father in arguments with my son. I still lose ...   One day I bought a house. One day --what a day!-- I became a father, and not too long after that I picked up the check for my own father. I thought then it was a milestone for me. One day, when I was a little older, I realized it was one for him too, another milestone. Which of the following best expresses the author's thinking ?", "subject": ""}

Emperor penguins sit on eggs to hatch them during Antarctica's freezing winter. The males have to gather closely together for warmth and can lose half of their weight in the two months that it takes the baby penguins to hatch.

The eighth-grader was inspired to kick off his creation on a recent morning, when his mother was driving him to school. Their car was damaged as it went over a huge pothole in the middle of the street in their hometown of Jackson, Mississippi. He decided to do something about the pothole problem in his city. Chokwe developed the app with his friends Rodriguez Ratliff and Emmanuel Brooks. When the app detects a pothole, it is highlighted in red. And if you get close to the pothole, your phone will warn you with a beep. Drivers can also use the app to report any potholes and look for other routes they can take to avoid roads that have them. The app relies on current available information about the streets of Jackson, already stored in a database of the city's 311 call system. Through the call system, citizens dial 3-1-1 to report non-emergency problems which include potholes. Chokwe and his friends determined that focusing on the 10 busiest streets in Jackson would give them a large enough sample size to test the prototype. While developing the app, the boys took part in a Minority Male Makers Program sponsored by Verizon and held at Jackson State University. They learned 3D printing and design, and how to create apps.

He says organizations almost always use new, creative technology only to continue what they already do. New technology should change organizations, he says, and disrupt them in a good way. They should use the technology to do things differently--for example, to serve more needs. The book says the needed disruptive force in education is computer-based learning. Michael Horn, another author of \"Disrupting Class\", told us about a Bostonpublic that he visited. Every student at Lilla G. Frederick Middle School inDorchester,Massachusetts, has a laptop computer. One class was learning about storms. Michael Horn says the laptops made it possible to truly individualize the lessons, to divide materials by ability level and learning style. At the end of the class, the students all took part in a discussion led by the teacher.

{"answer": 2, "choices": ["Children.", "Teachers.", "Parents.", "helmet producers."], "question": "Good Housekeeping has discovered that even if a child wear a helmet when she bikes, or skates, it may not protect her from a serious head injury. Every year, 390,000 children under age 15 go to hospital emergency rooms with bike-related injuries. Of that number, about one third children suffer head injuries and an estimated 200 die. By wearing a helmet, a child can reduce her risk of injury by as much as 85 percent. But remember ---- a bicycle helmet must fit properly to be safe. Here are five steps to making sure your child's helmet fits properly. 1) If you haven't bought your child's helmet already, you might want to consider one with a rear stabilizer . A rear stabilizer holds the back of the head gently and helps the helmet stay correctly positioned. 2) The helmet should fit closely and shouldn't slide from side to side or front to back. If your child can put two fingers on both temples inside the helmet, it's too big. Try a smaller size. But if the next size down is too small, use the fit pads . Fit pads come in different sizes and attach to the helmet with Velcro. 3) Tell your child to open her mouth widely and ask if she can feel the helmet push down onto the top of her head. If she can't, you need to readjust her helmet. 4) To prevent strap slippage, wind a rubber band around the strap where it meets the fastener. 5) Recheck the fit regularly. You should replace the bicycle helmet: If she has been in an accident with it. If the buckle  breaks or if a piece breaks off. If it doesn't have a U.S. Consumer Product Safety Commission, American Society for Testing and Materials, or Snell Memorial Foundation sticker. If it doesn't fit correctly.

Chinese taikonauts, Jing Haipeng, 50, and Chen Dong, 37, were _ into space onboard Shenzhou-11 at 7:30 am Monday and will spend 30 days in the Chinese space laboratory Tiangong-2.The launch marks a key step toward China's plan to eventually operate a permanent space station. The successful launch of the Shenzhou-11 spacecraft is another step forward to put China among leading players in space technology, said Alexander Zheleznyakov, a Russian expert on history of space flights. China's experimental space lab will help provide solutions for spacecraft of different functions to approach and anchor, and for a long-term operation of life support system, said Zheleznyakov. Shenzhou-11 is scheduled to anchor on Wednesday with Tiangong-2, which is part of China's plan to build a permanent space station by 2022. China can now test technologies for cargo spacecraft anchoring, life support system operation and water recycling to ensure a long-term continuous operation of its space station in the future with less dependence on renewal from the Earth, he said. If all goes well, China will launch the unpiloted Tianzhou-1 cargo ship next spring to autonomously tie up with Tiangong-2.

Chinese taikonauts, Jing Haipeng, 50, and Chen Dong, 37, were _ into space onboard Shenzhou-11 at 7:30 am Monday and will spend 30 days in the Chinese space laboratory Tiangong-2.The launch marks a key step toward China's plan to eventually operate a permanent space station. The successful launch of the Shenzhou-11 spacecraft is another step forward to put China among leading players in space technology, said Alexander Zheleznyakov, a Russian expert on history of space flights. China's experimental space lab will help provide solutions for spacecraft of different functions to approach and anchor, and for a long-term operation of life support system, said Zheleznyakov. Shenzhou-11 is scheduled to anchor on Wednesday with Tiangong-2, which is part of China's plan to build a permanent space station by 2022. China can now test technologies for cargo spacecraft anchoring, life support system operation and water recycling to ensure a long-term continuous operation of its space station in the future with less dependence on renewal from the Earth, he said. If all goes well, China will launch the unpiloted Tianzhou-1 cargo ship next spring to autonomously tie up with Tiangong-2. Tianzhou-1 will be capable of automatically transferring rocket fuels, a vital requirement for space station grouping and maintenance, according to a report by Columbia Broadcasting System (CBS). \"That will further their anchoring abilities needed for the larger space station,\" Johnson Freese was quoted.\" Tiangong-2 is supposed to be able to stay in orbit for two years or longer, so that's taking them (Chinese) really close to 2019 or so.

In the past years, Chinese people have made hard and determined efforts to realize the dream their ancestors had for thousands of years.

The country carried out its first one-piloted space flight in October, 2003, making China the third country in the world to have independent human spaceflight ability after the Soviet Union and the United States. Then came another breakthrough on October 12, 2005, when Shenzhou 6, China's second human spaceflight, was launched, with a crew of two astronauts. What's more, the landmark spacewalk done by Zhai Zhigang, one of the three boarding Shenzhou 7, launched on Sept. 25, 2008, leads the country further in its space exploration. Meanwhile, China's moon exploration project, started in 2004, has also been progressing satisfactorily. Fifty years after the Soviet Union launched Sputnik, the world's first man-made satellite, China's first circumlunar satellite Chang'e 1 took off on Oct.24, 2007, which became another milestone  in China's space achievements after the above-mentioned manned flights. Chang'e 1 was expected to fulfill four scientific goals, one of which was to probe mineral elements on the moon, especially those not existent on Earth. It's said that the lunar regolith  is abundant in helium-3, a clean fuel that may support the Earth's energy demands for more than a century. Nearly 3 years later, Oct. 1, 2010 witnessed the blasting off of Chang'e 2, China's 2nd unmanned lunar probe, marking another step forward in moon exploration. This time the aim is to test the key techniques of Chang'e 3 and Chang'e 4, as a preparation for a soft lunar landing in the future.

{"answer": 1, "choices": ["they may lose interest in their work", "they may appear to be well-behaved", "they may change to another person", "the results will be worse than usual"], "question": "For many years there's been a debate about rewarding our children. Does it work? Is it effective? Some people think we should establish a standard with our kids and give them something for meeting this standard as a reward. Punishment is given out in much the same way, but it's used when certain standards of performance, behavior, etc. have not been met. Kids will often become more dutiful when threatened with punishment, and work harder when promised a valuable reward. The problem is what happens when you aren't around. To develop responsible, self-disciplined   kids, parents need to promote certain ideas. One of these ideas is that everyone pitches in   and helps in your family, even if someone is not crazy about helping.

On my last trip to Disneyland (1999) we passed it by, because we didn't want to spend the time on something we didn't really enjoy. If we'd known it would be closed by our next visit, I'm sure we would have watched it one more time. I was just making the point that it wasn't until Disney announced the closing that this feeling suddenly sprang  up for the Country Bear Show at Disneyland. But I think the idea of keeping some attractions open forever regardless of the number of visitors it gets is a mistake. We all have great memories of the Bears, but clearly very few kids today (or I should say families today) are making those same memories from this show. That may be a sad fact, but it's a fact. Isn't it right to use the Country Bear space to bring in a more popular attraction so that more kids today can make those magic memories of an attraction they like? Otherwise aren't we just telling kids today that they \"have to\" make great memories of the Bears, when it's obvious that the kids themselves are not enjoying the Bears like we did? Roger: I am very disappointed that they have decided to retire the Country Bear Playhouse. I remember going to the show as a child, and still enjoyed it as a teenager, and now young adult. It is true that there aren't a lot of shows left at DL and with this one closing even less. Being at DL does require a lot of walking, and it is nice to have a few attractions that are a place to sit and enjoy a good show. I understand that DL has to develop, but there has to be some history to the Disneyland that Walt Disney first designed. There should be some parts of DL that just never go away, and this is one of them. By the time I have children it looks like there won't be any attractions that I can say I went to as a child at the rate they are going. Now the Bears are leaving, What I want to say is: stop trying to compete with everyone! DL is the best, because of attractions like the Country Bears. If DL insists on destroying all of its magic to make way for the latest, well, then it might as well be just another theme park.

{"answer": 2, "choices": ["Chinese female film stars", "Chinese male film stars", "Hollywood films", "Film stars in Hong Kong"], "question": "Chinese female film stars, like Gong Li and Zhang Ziyi, due to the charm of their films, have set a good image for Chinese women in the world. Compared with Chinese women, the image of Chinese men is not so good in the eyes of Western women, the Shanghai Evening Post reported. In March 2006, Zhang Jiehai, a doctorate  holder at the Sociology Institute of the Shanghai Academy of Social Sciences, led a research team to investigate how Western women look at Chinese men. The survey shows that many Western women think Chinese men are mostly known for their care for the family. Chinese men, as the Western women say, are willing to spend money for women. As to their shortcomings, Western women think that Chinese men do not have good manners and that some Chinese men have the habit of spitting everywhere, keeping nails and hair long, picking their noses and ears in public places, and not cleaning their teeth thoroughly. These bad habits make many Western women think that Chinese men are unwilling to take care of their personal image. The survey was carried out in two ways, by questionnaires and interviews. All the respondents  agreed that Chinese men show much tender loving care for the family and that many Chinese men do know how to respect women. They open the door for women and carry their handbags for them. For some American women, the bad image of Chinese men in the world is largely because of Hollywood films.

Compared with Chinese women, the image of Chinese men is not so good in the eyes of Western women, the Shanghai Evening Post reported. In March 2006, Zhang Jiehai, a doctorate  holder at the Sociology Institute of the Shanghai Academy of Social Sciences, led a research team to investigate how Western women look at Chinese men. The survey shows that many Western women think Chinese men are mostly known for their care for the family. Chinese men, as the Western women say, are willing to spend money for women. As to their shortcomings, Western women think that Chinese men do not have good manners and that some Chinese men have the habit of spitting everywhere, keeping nails and hair long, picking their noses and ears in public places, and not cleaning their teeth thoroughly. These bad habits make many Western women think that Chinese men are unwilling to take care of their personal image. The survey was carried out in two ways, by questionnaires and interviews. All the respondents  agreed that Chinese men show much tender loving care for the family and that many Chinese men do know how to respect women. They open the door for women and carry their handbags for them. For some American women, the bad image of Chinese men in the world is largely because of Hollywood films. In many Hollywood films, Chinese men usually do not have a good image. But this has been changed by Hong Kong film star Chow Yun-Fat. After the Chinese filmCrouching Tiger,Hidden Dragon was shown in cinemas in the United States in 2002, many Westerners began to change their impression of Chinese men.

About half of the piece is destroyed, but the remaining part hits the South Atlantic at 200 times the speed of sound. The sea boils and a huge hole is made in the seabed. Huge waves are created and spread outwards form the hole. The wall of water, a kilometer high, rushes towards southern Africa at 800 kilometers an hour. Cities on the African coast are totally destroyed and millions of people are drowned . Before the waves reach South America, the second piece of the comet lands in Argentina. Earthquakes and volcanoes ash set off in the Andes Mountains. The shock waves move north into California and all around the Pacific Ocean. The cities of Los Angeles, San Francisco and Tokyo are completely destroyed by earthquakes. Millions of people in the southern half of the earth are already dead, but the north won't escape for long. Because of the explosions, the sun is hidden by clouds of dust, temperatures around the world fall to almost zero. Crops are ruined. The sun won't be seen again for many years.

{"answer": 2, "choices": ["They are students from the same university.", "They failed in all the examinations.", "They both had experiences of test anxiety.", "They both had the same poor studying habits."], "question": "Doreen Sykora is now a junior at McGill University. She had a difficult time when she first began college. She said, \"I was always well prepared for my examinations. But when I go into class to take the exam, I would fall apart. I could just _ because of nervousness and fear.\" Hitoshi Sakamoto, an anthropology  student at Temple University in Tokyo reports similar experiences. These two young students were experiencing something called test anxiety. Because a student worries and is stressed  about a test, his or her mind does not work as well as it usually does. The student cannot write or think clearly because of the severe tension and nervousness. Now there are special university courses to help students. In these courses, advisors and psychologists try to help students by teaching them to manage test anxiety. Such a course helps students learn to live with stress and not fail because of it.

These two young students were experiencing something called test anxiety. Because a student worries and is stressed  about a test, his or her mind does not work as well as it usually does. The student cannot write or think clearly because of the severe tension and nervousness. Now there are special university courses to help students. In these courses, advisors and psychologists try to help students by teaching them to manage test anxiety. Such a course helps students learn to live with stress and not fail because of it.

Proper records are just not kept. We know that more than 850,000 children go through hospital each year, and that every child of school age has a legal right to continue to receive education while in hospital. We also know there is only one hospital teacher to every 1,000 children in hospital. Little wonder the latest survey concludes that the extent and type of hospital teaching available differ a great deal across the country. It is found that half the hospitals in England which admit children have no teacher. A further quarter have only a part-time teacher. The special children's hospitals in major cities do best; general hospitals in the country and holiday areas are worst off. From this survey, one can estimate that fewer than one in five children have some contact with a hospital teacher--and that contact may be as little as two hours a day. Most children interviewed were surprised to find a teacher in hospital at all. They had not been prepared for it by parents or their own school. If there was a teacher they were much more likely to read books and do math or number work; without a teacher they would only play games. Reasons for hospital teaching range from preventing a child falling behind and maintaining the habit of school to keeping a child occupied, and the latter is often all the teacher can do. The position and influence of many teachers was summed up when parents referred to them as \"the library lady\" or just \"the helper\".

The size of the bird decides the number of flaps it can do. The average lifetime of a hummingbird is 3 or 4 years, but some of them have lived beyond 12 years also. They are unique in many ways. Besides the number of rapid flaps they can do per second, they can also fly backwards. Hummingbirds have an amazing sense of assessing the amount of sugar in thenectar  they eat. They feed on the nectar of flowers. Hummingbirds do not feed on flowers whose nectar contains less than 10% sugar. Talk about a sweet tooth! As they cannot sustain themselves on nectar alone because of its poor nutritional value, they also feed on insects and spiders, and hummingbird food mixture that one can make at home. Attracting hummingbirds to your garden will require a little planning. Plant butterfly bush, mimosa, coral bells, foxglove, morning glory, etc. These flowers attract the hummingbirds due to their highvisibility  and nectar production. Avoid usingpesticides , as it will not only kill the insects around the flowers, but hurt the hummingbirds as well. A common food for these birds is the sweettastingsugar syrup .

The size of the bird decides the number of flaps it can do. The average lifetime of a hummingbird is 3 or 4 years, but some of them have lived beyond 12 years also. They are unique in many ways. Besides the number of rapid flaps they can do per second, they can also fly backwards. Hummingbirds have an amazing sense of assessing the amount of sugar in thenectar  they eat. They feed on the nectar of flowers. Hummingbirds do not feed on flowers whose nectar contains less than 10% sugar. Talk about a sweet tooth! As they cannot sustain themselves on nectar alone because of its poor nutritional value, they also feed on insects and spiders, and hummingbird food mixture that one can make at home. Attracting hummingbirds to your garden will require a little planning. Plant butterfly bush, mimosa, coral bells, foxglove, morning glory, etc. These flowers attract the hummingbirds due to their highvisibility  and nectar production.

The ancient Greeks turned it into a science, \"physiognomy\". As early as 500 BC, the mathematician Pythagoras would look carefully at young men's faces to determine if they'd make a good student, not long after Aristotle wrote how large-headed people were mean. It was widely believed at the time that the animal a person resembled was a good judge of character. By the Middle Ages it was well and truly mainstream. Professionals coined the phrase \"stuck-up\" to refer from the belief that those with upturned noses had an air of superiority, \"high-brow\" to refer to the high foreheads of nobles and \"low-brow\" to the less educated foreheads of the lower classes. Back in 2016, we're still doing it. We view those who resemble Labradors   as warm, while those who resemble lions as more of a ruler. We think of those with \"resting moody face\" as more aggressive, those who are less attractive as sick and expect people who look familiar to share our values. Many of these judgments occur in as little as 50 milliseconds. To get to understand and find out why having a babyface is so great, first we need to know what happens when we recognize an actual baby. In fact, the features of babies and those universally considered \"cute\" are nothing more than a series of developmental accidents. Our eyes are already fully grown by the time we're born but our heads aren't. Similarly, our bodies do a lot more growing later on than our heads. Babies have more body fat than adults, chubby  cheeks, for example. The list goes on. And regardless of whether you're very maternal   or find babies really annoying, we're unconditionally to respond to their features by turning into gentle baby-talking fools. Most importantly, gazing into their innocent faces makes us less aggressive and more generous and helpful. So there you have it.

If a child likes his friend, you have to make the child think about why. Once the child notices and recognizes goodness in others, he or she is likely to develop it as well. In fact, children learn most of their morals by watching people around them. They absorb behavior patterns from teachers and older students. They watch to see what is rewarded and who is punished.

Pete's grandfather had owned the shop until his death. Then the shop became Pete's. The front window was full of beautiful old things: jewelry of a hundred years ago, gold and silver boxes, carved figures from China and Japan and other nations. On this winter afternoon, a child stood there, her face close to the window. With large and serious eyes, she studied each piece in the window. Then, looking pleased, she stepped back from the window and went into the shop. Pete himself stood behind the counter. His eyes were cold as he looked at the small girl. \"Please,\" she began, \"would you let me look at the pretty string of blue beads in the window?\" Pete took the string of blue beads from the window. The beads were beautiful against his hand as he held the necklace up for her to see. \"They are just right,\" said the child as though she were alone with the beads. \"Will you wrap them up in pretty paper for me, please? I've been looking for a really wonderful Christmas present for my sister.\" \"How much money do you have?\" asked Pete. She put a handful of pennies on the counter. \"This is all I have,\" she explained simply. \"I've been saving the money for my sister's present.\" Pete looked at her, his eyes thoughtful. Then he carefully closed his hand over the price mark on the necklace so that she could not see it. How could he tell her the price? The happy look in her big blue eyes struck him like the pain of an old wound. \"Just a minute,\" he said and went to the back of the shop. \"What's your name?\" he called out.

It was wrapped in pretty Christmas paper. \"There you are,\" he said. \"Don't lose it on the way home.\" She smiled happily at him as she ran out of the door. Through the window he watched her go. He felt more alone than ever. Something about Jean Grace and her string of beads had made him feel once more the pain of his old grief. The child's hair was as yellow as the sunlight; her eyes were as blue as the sea. Once upon a time, Pete had loved a girl with hair of that same yellow and with eyes just as blue. And the necklace of blue stones had been meant for her. But one rainy night, a car had gone off the road and struck the girl. After she died, Pete felt that he had nothing left in the world except his grief. The blue eyes of Jean Grace brought him out of that world of self-pity and made him remember again all that he had lost. The pain of remembering was so great that Pete wanted to run away from the happy Christmas shoppers who came to look at his beautiful old things during the next ten days. When the last shopper had gone, late on Christmas Eve, the door opened and a young woman came in. Pete could not understand it, but he felt that he had seen her before. Her hair was sunlight yellow and her eyes were sea-blue. Without speaking, she put on the counter a package wrapped in pretty Christmas paper. When Pete opened the package, the string of blue beads lay again before him. \"Did this come from your shop?\" she asked. Pete looked at her with eyes no longer cold. \"Yes, it did,\" he said. \"Are the stones real?\" \"Yes. They aren't the best turquoise , but they are real.\" \"Can you remember to whom you sold them?\" \"She was a small girl. Her name was Jean.

When the last shopper had gone, late on Christmas Eve, the door opened and a young woman came in. Pete could not understand it, but he felt that he had seen her before. Her hair was sunlight yellow and her eyes were sea-blue. Without speaking, she put on the counter a package wrapped in pretty Christmas paper. When Pete opened the package, the string of blue beads lay again before him. \"Did this come from your shop?\" she asked. Pete looked at her with eyes no longer cold. \"Yes, it did,\" he said. \"Are the stones real?\" \"Yes. They aren't the best turquoise , but they are real.\" \"Can you remember to whom you sold them?\" \"She was a small girl. Her name was Jean. She wanted them for her sister's Christmas present.\" \"How much were they?\" \"I can't tell you that,\" he said. \"The seller never tells anyone else what a buyer pays.\" \"But Jean has never had more than a few pennies.

Pete's grandfather had owned the shop until his death. Then the shop became Pete's. The front window was full of beautiful old things: jewelry of a hundred years ago, gold and silver boxes, carved figures from China and Japan and other nations. On this winter afternoon, a child stood there, her face close to the window. With large and serious eyes, she studied each piece in the window. Then, looking pleased, she stepped back from the window and went into the shop. Pete himself stood behind the counter. His eyes were cold as he looked at the small girl. \"Please,\" she began, \"would you let me look at the pretty string of blue beads in the window?\" Pete took the string of blue beads from the window. The beads were beautiful against his hand as he held the necklace up for her to see. \"They are just right,\" said the child as though she were alone with the beads. \"Will you wrap them up in pretty paper for me, please? I've been looking for a really wonderful Christmas present for my sister.\" \"How much money do you have?\" asked Pete. She put a handful of pennies on the counter. \"This is all I have,\" she explained simply. \"I've been saving the money for my sister's present.\" Pete looked at her, his eyes thoughtful. Then he carefully closed his hand over the price mark on the necklace so that she could not see it. How could he tell her the price? The happy look in her big blue eyes struck him like the pain of an old wound. \"Just a minute,\" he said and went to the back of the shop. \"What's your name?\" he called out. He was very busy about something. \"Jean Grace,\" answered the child. When Pete returned to the front of the shop, he held a package in his hand. It was wrapped in pretty Christmas paper. \"There you are,\" he said. \"Don't lose it on the way home.\" She smiled happily at him as she ran out of the door. Through the window he watched her go. He felt more alone than ever. Something about Jean Grace and her string of beads had made him feel once more the pain of his old grief. The child's hair was as yellow as the sunlight; her eyes were as blue as the sea. Once upon a time, Pete had loved a girl with hair of that same yellow and with eyes just as blue. And the necklace of blue stones had been meant for her. But one rainy night, a car had gone off the road and struck the girl. After she died, Pete felt that he had nothing left in the world except his grief. The blue eyes of Jean Grace brought him out of that world of self-pity and made him remember again all that he had lost.

Of the youngest children (9 to 14 months), girls spent significantly longer playing with the doll than boys, and boys spent much more time with the car and ball than the girls did. Among the two and three-year-olds, girls spent 50 percent of the time playing with the doll while only two boys briefly touched it. The boys spent almost 90 percent of their time playing with cars, which the girls barely touched. There was no link between the parents' view on which toys were more appropriate for boys or girls, and the children's choice. Dr Brenda Todd said, \"Children of this age are already exposed to much socialization. Boys may be given 'toys that go' while girls get toys they can care for, which may help shape their preference. But these findings agree with the former idea that children show natural interests in particular kinds of toys. There could be a biological basis for their choices. Males through evolution have been adapted to prefer: moving objects, probably through hunting instincts , while girls prefer warmer colors such as pink, the colour of a newborn baby.\" What conclusion did Dr. Brenda Todd draw from the results of the study?", "subject": ""}

The boy looked around and said, \"We're losing by six runs   and the game is in the eighth inning  .I guess he can be on our team and we'll try to put him in to bat in the final inning. Shay struggled over to the team's bench and put on a team shirt with a broad smile and his father had a small tear in his eye and warmth in heart. The boys saw the father's joy at his son being accepted. In the bottom of the eighth inning, Shay's team scored a few runs but was still behind by three. In the top of the final inning, Shay put on a glove and played in the field. Even though no hits came his way, he was obviously joyful just to be in the game and on the field. In the bottom of the final inning, Shay's team scored again. Now, Shay was scheduled to be next at bat. Would they let Shay bat and give away their chance to win the game? Surprisingly, Shay was given the bat. Everyone knew that a hit was almost impossible. The first pitch   came and Shay missed. The pitcher again took a few steps forward to throw the ball softly towards Shay. As the pitch came in, Shay swung at the ball and hit a slow ground ball right back to the pitcher. The pitcher could have easily thrown he ball to the first baseman and Shay would have been out and that would have been the end of the game .Instead, the pitcher threw the ball right over the head of the first baseman, beyond the reach of all teammates, The audience and the players from both teams started screaming, \"Shay, run to first! \" Never in his life had Shay ever run that far but made it to first base, wide-eyed and shocked.. Everyone should, \"Run to second!\" Catching his breath, Shay awkwardly ran towards second. By the time Shay rounded towards second base, the smallest guy on their team, who had a chance to be the hero for his team for the first time, could have thrown the ball to the second baseman, but he understood the pitcher's intentions and he too intentionally threw the ball high and far over the third baseman's head. All were screaming,\"Shay,Shay,Shay,all the way Shay.\" Shay reached third base when one opposing player ran to help him and shouted, \"Shay, run to third.\" As Shay rounded third, all were on their feet, crying,\"Shay, run home!\"Shay ran to home, stepped on the home base and was cheered as the hero who the who won the game for his team. That day, the boys from both teams helped bring a piece true love and humanity into this world. Shay didn't make it to another summer and died that winter, having never forgotten being the hero and making his father so happy and coming home and seeing his mother tearfully hug her little hero of the day!

Although most girls heard the stories, damage appeared to be done to those who adopted the characters as role models. \"They believe if their love is strong enough they can change their parents' behaviors,\" she said.\" Overexposure in children to stories that emphasize the transformational qualities of love may make women believe they can change their partners.\" For example, they might never have understood the obvious flaw in the story of Rapunzel, who remained locked in a high tower until rescued by a knight on a white horse, who broke the door down. \"The question,\" said Ms Darker Smith, \"is why she did not break the door down herself.\" Which of the following statements is true of the women in a control group?", "subject": ""}

Until about a century ago, the deep ocean floor was completely inaccessible and hidden beneath waters averaging over 3,600 meters deep. Totally without light and in the case of intense pressures hundreds of times greater than at the earth's surface, the deep-ocean bottom is a strange environment to humans, in some way as frightening and remote as the outer space. Although researchers have taken samples of deep-ocean rocks for over a century, the first detailed global study of the ocean bottom did not actually start until 1969, with the beginning of the National Science Foundation's Deep Sea Drilling Project(DSDP). Using techniques first developed for the offshore oil and gas industry, the DSDP's drill ship, the Glomar Challenger, was able to maintain a steady position on the ocean's surface and drill very deep waters, taking samples of rocks from the ocean floor. The Glomar Challenger completed 96 voyages in a 15-year research program that ended in November 1983. During this time, it sailed 600,000 kilometers and took almost 20,000 samples of rocks around the world. Those samples have allowed geologists to reconstruct what the planet looked like hundreds of millions of years ago and to make out what it will probably look like millions of years in the future. Today, largely on the strength of evidence gathered during the Glomar Challenger's voyages, nearly all earth scientists agree on the theories of plate tectonics   and continental drift that explain many of the geological processes. The sample of rocks drilled by the Glomar Challenger have also provided a climatic record stretching back hundreds of millions of years.

The truth is that you're packing a lot of sensitive information on your phone, and you should keep it safe. When it comes to physical security, iPhone users would do well to download Find My iPhone, a free app from Apple that allows you to visit a website and see your (lost, stolen or misplaced) phone on the map. You can then sound an alarm, send a message that will pop up on its screen, lock the phone or erase all your data. Android does not have an exact equivalent , but there are plenty of alternatives. A free app called Lookout offers the find-my-phone feature. The paid version allows you to wipe the data from your phone remotely. Then there is your coffee shop's WiFi network. Anyone with minimal technical expert skill can snoop on  people using shared wireless networks, harvesting passwords and other personal data. Lookout's apps will caution you when you've logged on to an insecure network, but cannot protect you once you're there. In order to protect yourself on such networks, you can use a virtual private network, or V.P.N. This turns all your activity into nonsense to anyone trying to read along with you from across the Starbucks. It also keeps websites from tracking you and, if you're traveling, allows you to get access to sites that may be blocked in other countries.

According to Dunham, Yale's assistant professor of psychology, \"When teenagers code it that way, a gift is no longer something given freely and voluntarily\"--it's just mom and dad living up to their obligation. Parents do have the right to demand good manners and children should thank sincerely whoever gives them something. But kids can't know how blessed they are unless they have a basis for comparison. And they don't learn that by a parent complaining that they're ungrateful. We need to give our children the gift of a wider world view.

The last female singer to spend that long at No.1 in the UK was Madonna in 1990 with her greatest hits compilation, The Immaculate Collection. For Adele, the success of 21 is part of a perfect storm of talent, timing and a connection that went beyond gender, age and credibility. But what does it say about the state of the music industry? Does Adele's success signal a return to the MOR  musical depression, when the likes of James Blunt dominated the charts? Her success may well lead to a great many similar acts aiming for an MOR audience, but that's more the fault of an industry desperate to recreate any kind of success by creating poor copies until the world shouts \"stop now\". What seems to have set Adele apart is her apparent ordinariness, besides that incredible voice. While Gaga parades around in a dress made of meat and Beyonce orbits a world out of touch to the majority of most human beings, Adele's chain-smoking, girl-you'd-like-to-go-to-the-pub-with persona stands out. Even for a British act, her ordinariness goes against trend, with fellow Jessie J adopting a very American habit of over-emoting, talking about a \"journey\" and making the idea of being a pop star seem fairly difficult. It's this universality and broad appeal that's helped her translate talent into sales. While the first single from 21, Rolling in the Deep, appealed to Radio 1 listeners and bloggers, the second single, Someone Like You, is so successful that silenced the grand O2 Arena during this year's Brit Awards. The press can write pages and pages in that there's enough of a connection of musicians - Rick Rubin worked on the album, there's a cover of the Cure, Mumford & Sons were an influence - while the gossip magazines have been excited by the fact that the album is one long break-up record, eager to find the ex. In 1990, Madonna was a global superstar with a back catalogue of era-defining hits to her name. She was untouchable and, tellingly, unknowable.

{"answer": 1, "choices": ["satisfying", "disappointing", "dangerous", "desperate"], "question": "Last week Adele's second album, 21, sold 257,000 copies in the UK, a sales figure that would look incredible as an opening sales week for any album by any global superstar. The fact that the album was celebrating its 10th week at No.1, and that each of the previous nine weeks it had sold over 100,000 copies, makes what Adele has achieved look miraculous. The last female singer to spend that long at No.1 in the UK was Madonna in 1990 with her greatest hits compilation, The Immaculate Collection. For Adele, the success of 21 is part of a perfect storm of talent, timing and a connection that went beyond gender, age and credibility. But what does it say about the state of the music industry? Does Adele's success signal a return to the MOR  musical depression, when the likes of James Blunt dominated the charts? Her success may well lead to a great many similar acts aiming for an MOR audience, but that's more the fault of an industry desperate to recreate any kind of success by creating poor copies until the world shouts \"stop now\". What seems to have set Adele apart is her apparent ordinariness, besides that incredible voice. While Gaga parades around in a dress made of meat and Beyonce orbits a world out of touch to the majority of most human beings, Adele's chain-smoking, girl-you'd-like-to-go-to-the-pub-with persona stands out. Even for a British act, her ordinariness goes against trend, with fellow Jessie J adopting a very American habit of over-emoting, talking about a \"journey\" and making the idea of being a pop star seem fairly difficult. It's this universality and broad appeal that's helped her translate talent into sales. While the first single from 21, Rolling in the Deep, appealed to Radio 1 listeners and bloggers, the second single, Someone Like You, is so successful that silenced the grand O2 Arena during this year's Brit Awards.

Lukla Airport Lukla Airport, is a small airport in the town of in the town of Lukla, eastern Nepal. A program titled Most Extreme Airports, rated the airport as the most dangerous airport in the world. The airport is popular because Lukla is the place where most people start the climb to Mount Everest Base Camp. High wind, cloud cover, and changing visibility often mean flights can be delayed or the airport closed. The airport's runway is accessible only to helicopters and small, fixed-wing, short-takeoff-and-landing aircraft. The runway is only 527m with an elevation of 2,845m. Princess Juliana International Airport Princess Juliana International Airport is in the country of Saint Maarten. The airport is perhaps best known for very low-altitude flyover landing approaches due to one end of its runway being extremely close to the shore and Maho Beach. The thrilling approaches and ease of access for shooting spectacular images make the airport one of the world's favorite places among plane spotters. Gibraltar Airport Gibraltar Airport serves the British overseas territory of Gibraltar, a tiny peninsula with an area of only 6.8 square kilometers.

That's the magic power of airplanes as well as airports. Similar as most airports are, some do have their unique features. Lukla Airport Lukla Airport, is a small airport in the town of in the town of Lukla, eastern Nepal. A program titled Most Extreme Airports, rated the airport as the most dangerous airport in the world. The airport is popular because Lukla is the place where most people start the climb to Mount Everest Base Camp. High wind, cloud cover, and changing visibility often mean flights can be delayed or the airport closed. The airport's runway is accessible only to helicopters and small, fixed-wing, short-takeoff-and-landing aircraft. The runway is only 527m with an elevation of 2,845m. Princess Juliana International Airport Princess Juliana International Airport is in the country of Saint Maarten. The airport is perhaps best known for very low-altitude flyover landing approaches due to one end of its runway being extremely close to the shore and Maho Beach. The thrilling approaches and ease of access for shooting spectacular images make the airport one of the world's favorite places among plane spotters. Gibraltar Airport Gibraltar Airport serves the British overseas territory of Gibraltar, a tiny peninsula with an area of only 6.8 square kilometers. The lack of flat space there means the peninsula's only runway is bisected by its busiest road, the Winston Churchill Avenue that heads towards the land border with Spain.

Who's going to solve all these terrible problems? Yes, politicians and world leaders will have a big part to play. Yes, businesses will need to create the economic wealth to pay for some of these things. But who's going to make a much greater difference to something like AIDS or climate change? It's going to be a scientist. It is the scientist who can turn some new bit of science into a new technology to solve these problems. If you like thinking about the world around you, why not become a scientist? It doesn't mean you have to wear a white coat and plastic glasses and spend all your time in a lab as most people often imagine!

Since it touches almost every aspect of our life, educated people need at least some idea of its structure and operation. They should also have an understanding of the subculture in which scientists live and the kinds of people they are. An understanding of general characteristics of science as well as specific scientific concepts is easier to obtain if one knows something about the things that excite and frustrate the scientist. This book is written for the intelligent student or lay   person whose knowledge of science is superficial; for the person who has been presented with science as a musty storehouse of dried facts; for the person who sees the chief objective of science as the production of small devices; and for the person who views the scientists as some sort of magician. The book can be used to supplement a course in any science, to accompany any course that attempts to give an understanding of the modern world, or independently of any course, simply to provide a better understanding of science. We hope this book will lead readers to a broader perspective on scientific attitudes and a more realistic view of what science is, who scientists are, and what they do. It will give them an awareness and understanding of the relationship between science and our culture and an appreciation of the roles science may play in our culture. In addition, readers may learn to appreciate the relationship between scientific views and some of the values and philosophies that are widespread in our culture. We have tried to present in this book an accurate and up-to-date picture of the scientific community and the people who populate it. That population has in recent years come to consist of more and more women. This increasing role of women in the scientific subculture is not an unique incident but, rather, part of the trend evident in all parts of society as more women enter traditionally male-dominated fields and make significant contributions. In discussing these changes and contribution, however, we are faced with a language that is somewhat sexist, one that uses male nouns or pronouns in referring to unspecified individuals. To balance this built-in bias  , we have adopted the policy of using plural nouns and pronouns whenever possible and , when absolutely necessary, alternating him and her. This policy is far from being ideal, but it is at least an acknowledgement of the inadequacy of our language in treating half of the human race equally. We have also tried to make the book entertaining as well as informative. Our approach is usually informal. We feel, as many other scientists do, that we shouldn't take ourselves too seriously.

Codes and ciphers have played an important role in the history of the world. Julius Caesar, the Roman ruler who defeated almost all the countries in Europe about 2,000 years ago, used a cipher when he sent secret messages to his troops.

In World War II, the Americans\"broke\"or figured out Japan's most important navy codes and got enough information to destroy a powerful Japanese fleet. Storekeepers use codes to mark their goods.

They were determined to find out if she really was a witch.  They watched nervously as she took a broomstick to sweep the dirt from her stone steps. But much to their disappointment, she didn't get on the broomstick and fly off. The old lady only looked up when her hen began to make sounds loudly --signaling that she had laid an egg in the nest on the top of the haystack. . The old lady put aside her broomstick and walked to the haystack, followed by Michael, a black cat she had rescued from a fox trap. With only three legs, it was hard for Michael to keep up with his mistress. The cat was proof for the children that only a witch would own a black cat with three legs! Crawling further along the branches, they could clearly see the haystack. Mrs. Taylor was standing on a wooden box with the new-laid egg in one hand. Placing the egg in her pocket, she readied herself to climb down. Then, without warning, the box broke under her and she crashed to the ground. The children were in horror. \"Should we go and help her?\" asked Mia. \"What if it's a trick?\" replied Patrick. \"She probably knows we're here. Witches know things like that!\" After thinking for a while, Julia said\"Anyway, we should go and check whether she is all right.\" Approaching _ , they could see a wound on the old lady's forehead. She had knocked her head on a stone and was unconscious. \"Go and get Dad,\" Mia yelled to her brothers. \"Tell him about the accident.\" The boys didn't need another excuse to leave. They ran as fast as they could for help, hoping that Mrs. Taylor would not regain consciousness and turn the girls into frogs. Later, in the hospital, the old lady smiled her thanks. \"I was so lucky that you lovely children happened to be passing when 1 fell. I must have yelled quite loudly.\" The children exchanged guilty glances, but were very pleased that she was not a witch after all!

Keri Glassman, a registered dietitian and founder of Nutritious Life Meals, appeared on \"Good Morning America\" today to give you a glimpse into the diets of some top athletes. Some of their meals could surprise you. Crazy Calorie Count  _ One secret of swimmer Michael Phelps' astonishing performance in the 2008 Olympics in Beijing was consuming as many as 12,000 calories in one day. Athletes can eat like this and not gain any weight because their workouts are intense. According to Glassman, Phelps' workouts can burn 4,000 to 6,000 calories in a day, and those calories must be replenished   in order to train the following day. Snacking Secrets Some athletes eat wacky (strange, unusual) foods that they swear improve their performance. Yohan Blake, the Jamaica sprinter and 100-meter world champion, has been making waves for stealing champion sprinter Usain Bolt's thunder on the track during the Olympic trials. Asked about how he gets his stamina, Blake answered that he eats 16 bananas per day, Glassman said. Jonathan Horton, the lead gymnast on the US team, has a blood sugar problem. His solution is honey. When he starts to feel shaky at the gym, he takes swigs of honey to boost his energy, Glassman said. Foods for Recovery What are the best foods to help the body recover after rigorous (strict) competition? For Olympic swimmer Ryan Lochte, the recovery meal is grilled chicken breasts with Alfredo sauce, whole-grain spaghetti and a salad with lemon juice and olive oil.

At last, I found a place near the back. The man in the seat next to the one I was going for was an older man in a grey suit, well-worn dress shoes, and a black hat like I always pictured reporters wearing, but without the little press card. Seated, I began to read the book I had been carrying, which was Jack Kerouac's On the Road. The man in the seat next to me introduced himself by asking if I had read any other book like the one I was holding. When I told him I had, he seemed to become interested, and so did I. He introduced himself as Carl and asked if I liked jazz, and I told him that I didn't really listen to it, and that I liked rock and roll. Waiting for Carl to tell me that I should listen to real music, I was shocked when he just smiled and nodded. He said, \"You remind me of myself when I was your age. I remember how my parents hated jazz and how they couldn't see how I could listen to that awful noise. I bet your parents say the same thing, don't they?\" Now it was my turn to smile, amused with how right he was. As the bus carried us from one side of the city to the other, Carl and I talked about a lot of different things. The more we talked, the more amazed I became at how much the two of us really had in common, despite the age difference. I haven't seen him since we parted, but the thought of our connection that day rarely leaves my mind. Carl really made me think about how much we can learn from each other if we just break through the blocks between us we've got. I mean, I would have never thought before that day that I could have anything in common with someone so much older than I. But Carl taught me that no matter what we are, we are all just people, and that we should make an extra effort to try and get to know our neighbors and people we see every day, regardless of age, race, religion, sex, or anything else. If we all take the time to attempt to understand each other, I think that the world would be a much better place that we could share together, as humans.

His powerful hands, then age 33, wrapped all the way around my tiny arms, then age 4, and easily swung me up to his shoulders to command all I surveyed. The relationship between a son and his father changes over time. It may grow and flourish in mutual maturity. It may sour in hated dependence or independence. With many children living in single-parent homes today, it may not even exist. But to a little boy right after World War II, a father seemed a god with strange strengths and strange powers enabling him to do and know things that no mortal could do or know. Amazing things, like putting a bicycle chain back on, just like that, or building a hamster cage, or guiding a jigsaw so it forms the letter F; I learned the alphabet that way in those pre-television days. There were, of course, rules to learn. First came the handshake, a good firm squeeze accompanied by an equally strong gaze into the other's eyes. \"The first thing anyone knows about you is your handshake,\" he would say. And we'd practice it each night on his return from work, the serious toddler in the old Cleveland Indian's cap running up to the giant father to shake hands again and again until it was firm enough. One day, I realize now, there was a change. I wasn't trying to please him so much as I was trying to impress him. I never asked him to come to my football games. He had a high-pressure career, and it meant driving through most of Friday night. But for all the big games, when I looked over at the sideline, there was that familiar fedora . And by God, did the opposing team captain ever get a firm handshake and a gaze he would remember? Then, a school fact contradicted something he said. Impossible that he could be wrong, but there it was in the book. These accumulated over time, along with personal experiences, to strengthen my own developing sense of values. And I could tell we had each taken our own, perfectly normal paths. I began to see, too, his blind spots, his prejudices and his weaknesses. I never threw these up at him. He hadn't to me, and, anyway, he seemed to need protection. I stopped asking his advice; the experiences he drew from no longer seemed relevant to the decisions I had to make.  He volunteered advice for a while. But then, in more recent years, politics and issues gave way to talk of empty errands and, always, to illness. After much thought and practice \" You can do whatever you have to do.\", one night last winter, I sat down by his bed and remembered for an instant those terrifying dark holes in another house 35 years before. I told my father how much I loved him. I described all the things people were doing for him. But, I said, he kept eating poorly, hiding in his room and violating the doctor's orders. No amount of love could make someone else care about life, I said; it was a two-way street. He wasn't doing his best. The decision was his. He said he knew how hard my words had been to say and how proud he was of me. \"I had the best teacher,\" I said. \"You can do whatever you have to do.\" He smiled a little. And we shook hands, firmly, for the last time. Several days later, at about 4 A.M., my mother heard Dad shuffling about their dark room. \" I have some things I have to do,\" he said. He paid a bundle of bills. He composed for my mother a long list of legal and financial what-to-do's \" in case of emergency.\" And he wrote me a note. Then he walked back to his bed and laid himself down. He went to sleep, naturally. And he did not wake up. How old was the writer's father probably when he died?", "subject": ""}

I asked her what it was that she needed most in that moment, and she replied that she needed support, and my arms around her would be the best thing that she could hope for! Because I couldn't do that in that exact moment, I asked her to describe her surroundings to me (I have  ly no idea 'why', at the time), and said that if she hadn't heard from me in about 30 minutes, she could ring me back. I asked her to stay exactly where she was. After hanging up the phone, I just sat for a few seconds. After only a very short time a phone number jumped into my head. I rang the number and it was a woman who had bought a house from me about 18 months previously, when I was working in Real Estate. My exact words to her were these, \"Oh, it's you Liz, I have no idea why I'm calling you in particular, but my daughter is in trouble in Ayrlie Beach, and I just got the thought to ring you and tell you that. Have you any idea why?\" \"It could be because my son lives there,\" says Liz. \"Oh really, that's got to be it,\" I said. \"Do you mind giving me his phone number, Liz?\" \"Of course not, and I can only hope that he can be of some help!\" I rang straight away (only about 5 minutes have passed since telling my daughter that somehow I'd get her help). Fortunately, he answered immediately, and I told him the story of who I was, and why I'd rung. I gave him the description of my daughter; where she was standing; and that she needed emotional support if he could find it in his heart to help out so unexpectedly like this. \"Oh yes, I can see her,\" he said...\"she's right across the street from where I'm standing!\" He walked across the street and told my daughter that her Dad had sent him!

{"answer": 2, "choices": ["Going gray.", "Tips to make hair color1 last", "Why does hair turn gray?", "Gray hair is in fashion."], "question": "Gray hair is simply a part of the normal aging process, and the rate you go silver is genetically predetermined. Going gray is not associated with earlier death, and premature graying is not, generally speaking, a sign of an illness or ill health in younger adults. There are, however, some specific health conditions associated with gray or white hair, but for most of us, going gray is just a fact of life.  Hair color1 comes from the pigment melanin , which determines your individual shade. Hair without any melanin is pure white. The pigment is produced in cells called melanocytes, which inject pigment into the hair. At some point in everyone's lifetime, these cells slow down and eventually stop producing color1. Scientists have yet to identify the exact mechanism by which melanocyte cell death occurs.  A study of more than 4,000 women and men from 20 countries determined that about 75% of people between the ages of 45 and 65 have some gray hair. In general, people of European descent gray earliest followed by Asians and Africans. It's interesting to note that a lucky 1 in 10 has no gray hair by retirement age. Beginning at age 30, your chances of having gray hair go up 10-20% per decade.  It may feel like you have more grays after a stressful event, but that's probably because middle age is basically a series of anxiety-ridden events. Between working, raising kids, and caring for older parents, the \"sandwich\" years of 45-65 can be stressful, especially for women. They are also when we naturally start to look older.  At this point, there is still no silver bullet to keep away the grays. What would be the best title for this passage?", "subject": ""}

Traditionally, people will set off firecrackers to bid farewell to the Kitchen God who returns to Heaven to report the activities of every household over the past year to the Jade Emperor. However, such customs have lessened with time in the city and might seem unfamiliar to children nowadays. In order to preserve traditions for the next generation, Yu Dawu, a 66-year-old painter, recently published a picture book, Spring Festival in Beijing, for children to see how people used to celebrate the Chinese New Year. Based on an essay by Lao She (1899-1966), one of the most significant writers in modern Chinese literature, the picture book starts from the first holiday, La Ba, the eighth day of the 12th lunar month of the past year, when tradition says people should eat _ made of eight ingredients to bring good fortune in the coming year. It concludes with the Lantern Festival on the 15th day of the first lunar month of the new year, which marks the end of the Spring Festival. In the book, Yu creates a local family of four who live in an ordinary quadrangle courtyard, and readers follow the family as it celebrates the festival traditions. \"I am an old Beijinger, so when I was drawing and painting for this book, the memories of childhood rushed into my mind,\" recalls Yu at a book-sharing party earlier this week.

I have social anxiety, disorder and was wondering how it would be possible to see someone for help without my parents knowing about it. I know that they'd be anything but supportive. They would think I'm  ly out of my mind. The truth is, I've put off dealing with it, acting as if it'll just go away or that I'll outgrow it.

It seems the only place I'm actually happy is at home or with people that I've known all my life. Hope you can help!    Dear Lisa,     About 5 million Americans have some form of social anxiety disorder, also known as social phobia. While everyone experiences nervousness or fear in social situations to a certain extent, those with social anxiety disorder are weakened by their fear. They may have a constant, intense, and lasting fear of being watched and judged by others, or be terribly afraid of being embarrassed or laughed at by ways in which they behave. As you have described, this fear can prevent people with social anxiety disorder from doing everyday activities, such as going to school or work, and can become so much of a focus that they limit their socializing.     It's understandable that you are worried about how your parents might react to knowing what's been going on for you. Many people think that their families will blame them for how they're feeling or _ their concerns. Being honest with your parents, however, might help you to feel more at ease; it's possible that they've noticed your behavior and wondered about it, or even struggled with similar feelings themselves.

{"answer": 3, "choices": ["How is the rain forest different from other habitats?", "How does an animal's body size influence an animal's need for food?", "Why does rain forest provide an unusual variety of food for animals?", "Why do large animals tend to dominate the upper canopy of the rain forest?"], "question": "The canopy, the upper level of the trees in the rain forest, holds too much of climbing mammals   of moderately large size, which may include monkeys, cats, civets, and porcupines. Smaller species, including such as nice and small squirrels, are not as common overall in high tropical canopies as they are in most habitats globally. Small mammals, being warm blooded, suffer hardship in the exposed and uncertain environment of the uppermost trees. Because a small body has more surface area per unit of weight than a large one of similar shape, it gains or loses heat more rapidly. Thus, in the trees, where protection from heat and cold may be scarce and conditions may be changeable, a small mammal may have trouble maintaining its body temperature. Small size makes it easy to scramble among twigs   and branches in the canopy for insects, flowers, or fruit, but small mammals are defeated, in the competition for food, by large ones that have their own strategies for browsing among tbod-rich twigs. The weight of an ape hanging below a branch draws the leaves down so that fruit-bearing leaves drop toward the ape's face. Walking or leaping species of a similar or even larger size access the outer twigs either by breaking and gaining the whole branch or by catching hold of hard branches with the feet or tail and picking food with their hands. Small climbing animals may reach twigs readily, but it is harder for them than for large climbing animals to cross the wide gaps from one tree top to the next that typify the high canopy. A gibbon can hurl itself farther than a mouse can: it can achieve a running start, and it can more effectively use a branch as a springboard  . The forward movement of a small animal is seriously reduced by the air friction   against the  ly large surface area of its body.

As a result, vitamin supplements ,though expensive, are popular with people who worry that they are not getting enough vitamins from the foods they eat.

In fact, medical experts warn that taking too many of some vitamins can be harmful. For example, too much vitamin E can cause bleeding. People should discuss what vitamins they take with their doctors, as some vitamins can produce harmful side effects when mixed with medicines. Experts, however, do say that sometimes vitamins can help prevent disease. People who know they lack a particular vitamin should take vitamin supplements. Some older adults, for example, may not have enough vitamin B-twelve. This is because, as people get older, their body loses its ability to take it from foods. Also, people who spend much time inside may need some extra vitamin D as the skin makes this vitamin from sunlight. Different vitamins are found in different foods. Vitamin A is found in fish liver oil. It also is in the yellow part of eggs.

June 29 came and, of course, I hadn't lost a single pound; in fact I had gained two. But I figured a nice new girdle   would cure everything. So on our way out of the city we stopped once again at the store. I ran in and told the clerk I needed a large-size girdle. The shop assistant found the box with the described girdle marked \"LG\", and asked if I would like to try it on. \"Oh, no, a large will fit just right. I needn't try it on.\"               The next morning was rather hot, so I waited to get dressed until about 45 minutes before time to go. I opened the box only to find a new girdle in a small size. Since it was too late to find another one and the dress wouldn't fit right without a girdle, a fight broke out in the hotel room between me and the girdle. Have you ever tried to shake 20 pounds of potatoes into a five-pound bag? That's it. Finally my husband, laughing like crazy, got hold of each side and shook me down into it.

It described a male bird which takes a lot of pain to build a nest and the female bird takes shelter in it and nourishes the baby. When the bird learns to fly, the whole family flies off to a different place leaving behind the beautiful nest for other birds to grow their family in it. It made me wonder. How could they so easily sacrifice their house built with so much effort? One night, when I was deep in sleep, I got this particular dream. I was walking miles on the endless road, totally isolated but lined with beautiful trees on the either side.

I fell in love with that amazing part of art. Yeah, it was indeed a piece of art with every nook and corner touched artistically and lovingly. I don't know why I felt that it was done lovingly. Maybe because, things turn out to be beautiful only when we put our love into it -- just like the food prepared by mom which tastes more delicious with her love. I explored the house only to fall more in love with it. There was a sloping roof which matched with the greenery around; the large central open courtyard reminded me of the activities that might have taken place there which felt lively even now when it is completely deserted.

Elliot Woolley teaches sustainable manufacturing at Loughborough University in Britain. He spoke at the Global Conference on Sustainable Manufacturing, which was held earlier this month in Vietnam. Mr. Woolley said in poor countries, food is usually lost while it is still in the field or during storage and transportation. He said that is because food producers there are inefficient. These businesses are unable to operate effectively without wasting materials, time or energy. But he added that once food is sold in developing countries, people usually eat everything they buy. However, people in developed countries throw away as much as half of the food they purchase. In the US, big contributors to waste include supersized portions that customers simply can't manage, and\"eat as much as you want\"offers in restaurants. In the UK, over-conservative sell-by dates on labels and two-for-one offers of perishable items are key factors, encouraging consumers to buy too much food to start with and to throw away items that have reached their sell-by date, but which are still edible.

These two systems both have advantages and disadvantages. One advantage in Japan is that there is much more math and science than American students learn by the end of high school. In addition, students study more hours each day and more days each year than North Americans do. The difficult system also prepares students for a society that place emphasis on discipline and self-control. However, while memorization is an important learning method in Japanese schools, yet many students admit forgetting much of the information that they have memorized after exams. On the other hand, the educational system in North American has an advantage that students learn to think for themselves, which prepares them for a society that values creativity.

Teachers value the qualities that make each student special and different. You can see such values through their educational systems. For example, students needn't memorize lots of information. Instead, they work independently and find answers on their own. There are discussions for children to show their own ideas and opinions. By contrast, people have the same language, history, and culture in most Asian societies. As a result, Asia's educational system reflects society's belief in group goals and purposes rather than individualism.

There are now no red squirrels left in an area of more than 1,150 square kilometres (sq km) in Piedmont, according to research from the universities of Turin, Genoa and Varese. On the edge of this large region, the species is also under threat from the invasions of grey squirrels. If the spread of the grey squirrel continues uncontrolled, the species could spread as far as France, the scientists fear. They are calling for more research and control and conservation measures aimed at preserving the remaining red squirrel populations and containing the spread of the greys. Grey squirrels were introduced into Italy  ly recently, in 1948. They were a gift from the US ambassador and kept in Turin, but escaped into the wild and rapidly colonized the surrounding area - despite warnings from the UK, where importing grey squirrels was forbidden from before the Second World War, when the destructive effects of having imported greys in the 1880s had become clear. Grey squirrels are not only more aggressive than the native European red squirrel, which causes them to invade red-dominated areas and take over, but they also carry a deadly virus, the squirrel pox. While greys are largely immune to the virus, it is deadly to red squirrels, which typically die within one or two weeks of being infected. From only four animals in 1948, at Stupinigi near Turin, the greys spread rapidly in recent years. Until 1970 the distribution of greys was limited to the Stupinigi woods, occupying an area of about 12 sq km. By 1990 this area had expanded to more than 200 sq km, stretching mainly southwards into the Cuneo province. By 2000, grey squirrels occupied 900 sq km and this year, fresh research from the three universities shows that their distribution now extends to more than 2,000 sq km.

Also, if we don't find new kinds of energy, we will use up all the fossil fuels in the twenty-first century. Scientists are working hard to find other kinds of energy for the future. What might these sources of energy be? Energy from the wind All over the world, people use the power of the wind. It turns windmills and moves sailboats. It is a clean source of energy, and there is lots of it. Unfortunately, if the wind does not blow, there is no wind energy. Energy from water When water moves from a high place to a lower place, it makes energy. This energy is used to create electricity. In Brittany, France, for example, waterpower produces enough energy to light a town of 40,000people. Waterpower gives energy without pollution. However, people have to build dams to use this energy. Dams cost a lot of money, so water energy is expensive. Energy from the earth There is heat in rocks under the earth. Scientists use this heat to make geothermal energy. San Francisco gets half of the energy it needs from geothermal power. This kind of energy is cheap, but it is possible only in a few places in the world. Energy from the sun Solar panels on the roofs of houses can turn energy from the sun into electricity. These panels can create enough energy to heat an entire house.

But the program does a good enough job that it may be able to give linguists a head start, the statistician added. For centuries, scholars have reconstructed languages by hand: looking at the same word in two or more languages and making educated guesses about what that word's \"ancestor\" may have sounded like. For example, the Spanish word for man (\"hombre\") and the French word for man (\"homme\") developed from the Latin word \"homo.\" The way linguists compare words from descendant languages to reconstruct the parent language is called, appropriately, the comparative method. The early 19th-century linguist Franz Bopp was the first to compare Greek, Latin and Sanskrit using this method. Jacob Grimm, one of the Brothers Grimm of fairy tale fame, used the comparative method to show how Germanic languages developed from a common ancestor. The difference between that and Bouchard-Cote's program, the statistician says, \"is we do it on a larger scale.\" As a proof of concept, Bouchard-Cote fed words from 637 Austronesian languages (spoken in Indonesia, the Philippines, Malaysia and more) into the new algorithm, and the system came up with a list of what the ancestor words of all those languages would have sounded like. In more than 85 percent of cases, the automated reconstruction came within one character of the ancestor word commonly accepted as true by linguists. The algorithm won't replace trained human linguists, but could speed up language analysis. Using a computer to do large-scale reconstruction offers another advantage. Bouchard-Cote says, \"With big data sets, you can really start finding regularities ... You might find that certain sounds are more likely to change than others.\" So Bouchard-Cote's team tested the \"functional load hypothesis ,\" which says that sounds that are more important for two clearly different words are less likely to change over time. A formal test of this hypothesis in 1967 looked at four languages; Bouchard-Cote's algorithm looked at 637. \"The revealed pattern would not be obvious if we had not been able to reconstruct large numbers of protolanguages,\" Bouchard-Cote and his coauthors write in the new study. In addition to simply helping linguists understand how people spoke in the past, studying ancient languages can perhaps answer historical questions. For example, Bouchard-Cote says, \"Say people are interested in finding out when Europe was settled.

But in fact, almost everyone can invent. It's just that they do not recognize that their idea could be the start of an invention.      Once inventors see their ideas have some practical value, they don't let them slip away.      For example, the inventor of the dishwasher, American Josephine Cochrane, loved to give dinner parties. But she found it took too long to wash her dishes by hand and too many of them broke. She decided that a machine could do the job faster and with fewer mistakes. So, in 1886, she set out to make one for herself.      Like Cochrane's, most inventions are created to solve a problem. So, the first and most important step is to find the problem.      You can start by looking at what is wrong with things you use now. You can ask grandparents or neighbours if they remember ever saying: \"I wish someone would invent something for...\" Or you can look at people in different areas such as on the street, or at school. Then you might notice situations or things in need of improvement.      Remember to record your ideas and work. This will help you develop your invention and protect it when it is completed.      The next step is to think about possible solutions. An invention is a new way of solving a problem. So think of many, varied, and unusual ways.      You can often come up with a solution for a problem by looking at it from a different angle   or thinking about it in a new way.      Example 1 -- instead of thinking of shoes as protecting your feet from the ground, think of using something to protect the ground from your feet.      Example 2 -- instead of thinking about how you can carry oranges home from a store, think of how they can come to you by delivery or growing your own.      Example 3 -- instead of experimenting with only one solution, can you put two or three solutions together, or arrange them in different orders?      And if one solution doesn't work, can it be put to other uses? That was how yellow post-it notes (N) came about -- a \"failed\" adhesive   experiment proved a weak adhesive had good uses too!      After all, most inventions are not brand new. They do not come out of nowhere, but come out of things or ideas that already exist.

And if one solution doesn't work, can it be put to other uses? That was how yellow post-it notes (N) came about -- a \"failed\" adhesive   experiment proved a weak adhesive had good uses too!      After all, most inventions are not brand new. They do not come out of nowhere, but come out of things or ideas that already exist.   And the hardest part of inventing, even for a lot of inventors, is coming up with a problem and finding a solution. Once you have an idea, you can always get help building your invention.       This problem-solving technique can also work in your everyday lives. So, why not try it in your studies, in your relationship with others, or even in the way you look at the world? Which of the following is one of the ways to find a problem?", "subject": ""}

But experts believe that there is no link between cold weather and catching colds. So why are we particularly easy to catch colds this season? Internal Medicine expert, Dr Meenakshi Jain of Max Hospital says, \"One reason could be because people are likely to stay indoors, so the virus can spread easily. Also the virus grows strong and healthy under wet conditions.\" The common cold can be caused by any of up to 250 kinds of virus. The most common group of them is the kind of virus that hits the nose, which is called rhinovirus  . Rhinoviruses cause a third and half of all common colds. \"The kind of virus is spread through the nose and respiratory passages , by touch, and by contact with particles  in the air that are created by sneezing or coughing,\" says Dr Jain. There is no way to treat the common cold. However, there are some tips that can help. Wash your hands regularly, so that germs get killed. Don't touch your eyes, nose or mouth, which can limit your chances of infection .  Don't share drinking glasses with anyone as this will prevent the spread of the virus. Drink lots of water.

Unlike Bessie Smith, Ella Fitzgerald taught herself the sentimental music so popular in the 1930's -- songs like \"My Heart Belongs to Daddy\"-- and her recordings became best-sellers. During the 1940's she developed her own \"scat singing\" -- a breathless, nonsense--syllable style--for songs like \"Flying Home\" and \"Lady Be Good.\" Ella Fitzgerald was the perfect musical partner for her friend, the trumpeter Louis Armstrong, matching him in warmth and artistry. \"I just like music, period,\" she said. \"To me, it's a story. There's only one thing better than singing.... It's more singing.\" What does the passage imply about Ella Fitzgerald and Louis Armstrong?", "subject": ""}

In his popular courses at Mount Holyoke College in Massachusetts, he would often make classroom discussion lively by describing his own fighting experience in Vietnam. But as Ellis's reputation grew--his books on the Founding Fathers won both the National Book Award and the Pulitzer Prize ---the history professor began to entertain local and national reporters with his memories of war. Last year, after The Boston Globe reported Ellis's experience in the Vietnam war, someone who knew the truth about Ellis  _ Last week The Boston Globe revealed that Ellis, famous for explaining the nation's history, had some explaining to do about his own past. \"Even in the best of lives, mistakes are made,\" said Ellis. It turned out that while the historian had served in the Army, he'd spent his war years not in the jungles of Southeast Asia , but teaching history at West Point ( ). He'd also overstated his role in the antiwar movement and even his high-school athletic records. His admission shocked colleagues, fellow historians and students who wondered why someone so successful would beautify his past. But it seems that success and truthfulness don't always go hand in hand.  Even among the successful achievers, security experts say, one in ten is deceiving. And, oddly, people often beautify their past once they're famous, says Ernest Brod of Kroll Associates, which has conducted thousands of background checks. Then what makes them do it? Psychologists say some people succeed, at least in part, because they are uniquely adjusted to the expectations of others. And no matter how well-known, those people can be haunted ( ) by a sense of their own shortcomings. \"From outside, these people look anything but fragile,\" says Dennis Shulman, a psychoanalyst. \"But inside, they feel hollow, empty,\" While Ellis served in the Army, he   _", "subject": ""}

She has been announced as the richest woman of the world by BRW (formerly Business Review Weekly) in May 2012. Let's read more about her life and journey to the top. Georgina \"Gina\" Hope Rinehart was born on 9th February, 1954 in Perth, Western Australia, to Hope Margaret Nicholas and Lang Hancock, the mining king. Her father discovered one of the world's biggest reserves in the early 1950s. Gina gained lots of knowledge of the iron-ore industry while working with her father. She married an Englishman Greg Milton, at the age of 19 and together they had two children, John Langley and Bianca Hope. Soon the marriage broke off and she remarried in 1983. Frank Rinehart and Gina had two children: Ginia and Hope. Frank died in 1990. Since then, Gina has devoted herself to her work and empire. She was the sole heir   of her family's wealth. Then after her father died in 1992, she started her professional career as the Executive Chairman of Hancock Prospecting Pty Limited (HPPL) and other privately owned group of companies. At that time, the company centered its functioning to mining-related explorations and accumulation of vast mining leases  . From there, Rinehart worked her way towards transforming the leases into profit earning mines. She also worked together with other companies to raise capital. Her efforts made the business increase three times in 2011 as much as before. At home, Rinehart was working to expand the family business, but she did not satisfy herself with it. In 2010, she stepped into the media industry by acquiring 10% stake   in Ten Network Holdings. Afterwards, she went on to hold stake in Fairfax Media, proving that mining is not her only interest. In June 2012, by increasing her stake in Fairfax to 18.67%, she became the largest stakeholder in the company. With this, she now stands at the head of $US 29.3 billion worth of an empire. Two new projects related to the mining sector in Central Queensland and Roy Hill are expected to begin in 2013.

My own son, who basically grew up with his grandmother, the original manners expert, has perfect table manners. This is partly because he was exposed to manners at a very young age. However, when we eat at home, he would not practice manners. So I asked him why. He said, \"I behave the way I am supposed to behave when I'm out, but when I am at home I want to be comfortable.\" That's when I realized that most parents, myself included, do teach their children the proper way to behave outside the home, but they are also brought up to believe that at home, anything goes. My answer to him was \"good behavior has nothing to do with where you are or whom you are with\". Then he answered, \"But I behave properly when I'm with others so that they think better of me .\" And that is when I realized that I was doing things all wrong. I explained to him that it had nothing to do with what people think. This confused him even more. So I went on to explain that behavior, whether in your everyday interaction with people or at the dining table at home, is an expression of who you are. Well, at the age of 13, he got it. So basically, what I am saying is that teaching your children manners comes with the underlying lesson that it is not about what to do or not to do, but rather , who they are. This way it is not mechanical : it comes from within.  Teach your teens or children the basic courtesy of greeting their friends' parents and introducing themselves when they go to someone's home. Teach teenage boys to open the door of a car, or any door for that matter, for any girl, whether they are their girlfriends or not.

An American member of the team says he and  the others will soon begin a serious effort to clone humans. Panos Zavos says the team hopes to manufacture the world's first cloned baby within the next two years. In recent years, scientists have produced exact genetic copies of sheep and a few other animals. They created these clones from a single cell of an adult animal. Three years ago, another American doctor, Richard Seed, announced plans to clone a human being. However, there is no evidence that he has been successful. Doctor Zavos says the new international group plans to offer human cloning only to women who are currently not able to become pregnant or produce children. He says the aim is to assist people who want to have their own biological child. The technology would be similar to that used to clone animals. It would involve cleaning genetic material from a woman's egg. Doctors then would place genetic material from the woman's husband into the egg before putting it into the woman's uterus .

Among computer users today, between 50 and 90 percent of written letters take place through e-mail. That's much different from the days when everyone relied on \"snail mail\" . More and more new e-mail users are asking, \"How can I write better e-mail message?\" Here are six tips for you. (1)     Who are you writing to? Who are you writing to? A friend, a classmate, a teacher or a boss? Be sure the tone  of your e-mail message is right for the receiver. Using slang  or abbreviations  may be all right for your friends. But business letters should use full names and complete sentences. (2)     Be direct. Readers of e-mail have little patience. Say what you want to say directly. (3)     Use short sentences.  E-mail is quicker and more convenient than snail mail. It's also much easier to throw away. Don't use long sentences. Make your sentences short and clear. (4) Give enough details .  A terrible e-mail message reads like this: \"Did you get my e-mail?\" Someone reading this will wonder, \"Which e-mail? Sent when? About what?\" Today's e-mail users sometimes get many messages every day, so be sure your messages have enough details to be understood. (5) Use the subject line  well Readers see what's in the subject line of your message before anything else. Don't say \"Hi, from Wang Peng\"------ they can see who sent the message from the address. A short, direct explanation of the content  of your message will get you a faster answer. (6) Don't be too slow to answer. Remember that in the world of e-mail, things happen fast. If you take longer than a week to answer someone's message, it may be too late. Which of the following subject lines is the best?", "subject": ""}

(1)     Who are you writing to? Who are you writing to? A friend, a classmate, a teacher or a boss? Be sure the tone  of your e-mail message is right for the receiver. Using slang  or abbreviations  may be all right for your friends. But business letters should use full names and complete sentences. (2)     Be direct. Readers of e-mail have little patience. Say what you want to say directly. (3)     Use short sentences.  E-mail is quicker and more convenient than snail mail. It's also much easier to throw away. Don't use long sentences. Make your sentences short and clear. (4) Give enough details .  A terrible e-mail message reads like this: \"Did you get my e-mail?\" Someone reading this will wonder, \"Which e-mail? Sent when? About what?\" Today's e-mail users sometimes get many messages every day, so be sure your messages have enough details to be understood.

My arts education at Pratt Institute has helped me develop a firm foundation in the arts.The courses I have completed at Pratt,along with my study abroad in Paris,has prepared me well for a position in arts education.I have always enjoyed a passion for the arts but my undergraduate  education has taken my interest to a whole new level.I not only enjoy doing art but I find myself even more enthusiastic when I have the opportunity to teach what I have learned. For the past two summers I have worked directly with children at CityArts.These experiences were amazing since my responsibilities included planning and directing major projects that were planned for the summer program that goes on each year for local children interested in the arts.I was given a concept at the beginning of each summer and I had complete control of how the projects were to be completed.The children were the creative force and often were the inspiration for the artwork that was eventually presented to the public. I am very excited about the summer opportunity with the Children's Museum of the Arts since I know that I can definitely make a positive contribution while doing what I love,teaching art to children.I will contact you in one week to discuss my candidacy and see if you have any questions about my education or experience.Thank you for your time and consideration.

A number of experts have also said the one-child policy is another reason leading to poor mental health in the young. Children are said to be too \" spoiled\" and \"selfish\" in a one-child family.

Poland is a surprising educational success story: in the past decade, the country raised students' test scores from significantly below average to well above it. Polish kids have now outscored American kids in math and science, even though Poland spends, on average, less than half as much per student as the United States does. One of the most striking differences between the high school Tom attended in Gettysburg and the one he ends up at in Wroclaw is that the latter has no football team or teams of any kind. That American high schools spend more time and money on sports than on math is an old complaint. In December, when the latest Program for International Student Assessment (PISA) results are announced, it's safe to predict that American high-school students will once again show their limited skills in math and reading, outscored not just by students in Poland but also by students in places like China, Finland, Singapore, and Japan.

Dave Matthews, the head of Hawthorn High School in the South Wales valleys, said the program aimed at helping teenagers who are unwilling to study. He said, \"There are lots of pupils who don't have a high level of home support. It's almost cool to say you have no need to find a support and we have got to change that. With this, they don't have to be sitting at their desk at home. They can be outside, walking around or even listening to it on the bus, which is very convenient for them.\" Everyone has a phone, MP3 or CD player, and they're more likely to listen to these than pick up a book. \"I think everyone would agree that music had an important influence on us when growing up. Both boys and girls are very good at remembering the words and dancing to the music in the charts. There's no one thing that will successfully engage (...) every child, and some of them will make little or no use of this. But the fact that they don't have to do any extra work makes this a very good deal for a kid,\" Dave Matthews added. Which of the following might be the best title for the passage?", "subject": ""}

It is here, perhaps, that we can find the start of the mystery of the Titanic, in the year 1910, in the great city of Cairo. One day, a famous professor of Egyptian history called Douglas Murray was staying in Cairo, when he was contacted by an American adventurer. The American had something unusual to offer Murray, something that was certain to thrill him: a beautiful ancient Egyptian mummy case, containing the mummy of an Egyptian queen. It was over 3000 years old, but in beautiful condition -- gold, with bright paintings on it. Murray was delighted with both the object and the asking price. He gave the man a cheque immediately. The cheque was never cashed. That evening the American adventurer died. For his part, Murray arranged to have the treasure sent back to Britain. However, it was not long before he learnt more about the beautiful mummy case: On the walls of the tomb in which it had been discovered, there were messages which warned of terrible consequences to anyone who broke into the tomb. Murray was disbelieving of these warnings until a few days later, when a gun he was holding exploded in his hand, shattering his arm. The arm had to be cut off. After the accident, Murray decided to return to his homeland. On the return journey, two of his companions died mysteriously, and two servants who had handled the mummy also passed away. The now-terrified Murray decided he would get rid of the _ case as soon as he arrived in London. A lady he knew named Janet Jones said she would like it, so he gave it to her. Shortly afterwards, Jones' mother died, and she herself caught a strange disease. She tried returning the mummy, but naturally Murray refused it. In the end, it was presented to the British Museum. Even in the museum, the mummy apparently continued to cause strange events. A museum photographer died shortly after taking pictures of the new exhibit; and a manager also died for no apparent reason. In the end, the British Museum decided to get rid of the mummy too. They sold it to a collector in New York. At the start of April 1912, arrangements for the transfer were complete, and the mummy began the journey to its new home.

The course is one of the most popular in the prison. Prisoners have to earn the right to attend the course and they work hard to get in.

They trust animals in ways they don't with humans. Yet, they hold a misunderstanding of how animals treat one another. Many admit that their own \"animal behavior\" is what got them into trouble in the first place. I teach that though there is competition and aggression in the animal kingdom, there is also a lot of cooperation and sympathy. Many of the students want to build healthy relationships, and they find that the class helps them.

Even in the same litter , both brown and black furred bears may be born. Black bears are the smallest of all American bears, ranging in length from 5 to 6 feet, weighing from 300 to 500 pounds. Their eyes and ears are small and their eyesight and hearing are not as good as their sense of smell. Like all bears, the black bear is shy, clumsy  and rarely dangerous. However, if cornered, the black bear can become a fearful enemy. Black bears feed on leaves, roots, fruit, insects, fish and even larger animals. One of the most interesting characteristics of bears, including the black bear, is their winter sleep. Unlike many other animals, bears do not actually hibernate . Although the bear does not eat during the winter months, its temperature remains almost normal, and it breathes regularly four or five times per minute. Most black bears live alone, except during the mating season  . A litter of one to four cubs is born in January or February and they remain with their mother until they are fully grown or about one and a half years old.

Even if scientists did discover another reasonable explanation for the warming observed so far, that would beg a difficult question. As Robert Henson puts it in The Rough Guide to Climate Change: \"If some newly discovered factor can account for the climate change, then why aren't carbon dioxide and the other greenhouse gases producing the warming that basic physics tells us they should be?\" The only way to prove with 100% certainty that humans are responsible for global warming would be to run an experiment with two _ Earths - one with human influence and one without. That obviously isn't possible, and so most scientists are careful not to state human influence as an   certainty. Which of the following can be the best title?", "subject": ""}

{"answer": 0, "choices": ["It was really a piece of good luck.", "She was the only qualified person for it.", "Virginia Woolf was very familiar to her.", "She was a member of the Translation Bureau."], "question": "For years I have been asked by several people how and why I came to translate a novel by Virginia Woolf in 1945. I graduated from the University of Ankara in 1941 and my four teachers, including Orphan Burian, are members of the Translation Bureau who prepared a list of works to be translated into Turkish and set themselves to translating some of these, besides shouldering the heavy work of correcting or editing the translations submitted to the Bureau. Orphan Burian, now mostly known for his translations of Shakespeare, had started to translate To the Lighthouse for the Translation Bureau, but at the same time he wanted to do something from Shakespeare. So he transferred it to me. For me, To the Lighthouse was love at first sight or rather at first reading. To translate a book, I first read it from the beginning to the end. Then I started writing each sentence by hand. When I finished the whole book I read my translation from the beginning to the end, checking it with the original, and making corrections. Then I typed it, and read the typed copy, making changes again. All in all that added up to five readings. I started translating the novel in 1943 and submitted it to the Bureau in 1944. It was published in 1945 under the general title of \"New English Literature\" in the series called \"Translations from World Literature\" known as the \"Classical Series\". So, the first book by Virginia Woolf in Turkish appeared in 1945, and it was To the Lighthouse. This was eighteen years after its publication in England in 1927. To me the book itself was pure poetry; I read it as if in a dream. Not trying to dive very deeply into it, I sort of swam on it or over it. Now, years later, _ . Even after so many years, in each reading I become conscious of new layers of which I haven't been aware before. It keeps pace with my experiences in life as years go by, and each reading is a new reading for me. In 1982 and again in 1989 I revised it for two new editions and I again did it sentence by sentence checking it with the original. In those years I had thought it was necessary to revise my translations every ten years, but now I think I must do it every three or four years. In a country like Turkey, where we work very hard to clear our language from old and new foreign words, we should try to be up to date as to the words we are using, and of the same importance are the studies being made on the methods or techniques of translation, and new approaches in translation. While translating, I usually have both the writer and the reader in mind. The novels she wrote after 1920 were especially new for most of the readers. She usually uses very short sentences, followed by rather long ones. I remember sentences of more than ten lines which weren't easy for me to translate as they were. And in Turkish our having only one word, the word \"O\", for \"he\", \"she\", \"it\" in English, made me repeat the names of the characters more often than Woolf did. And I changed some long indirect sentences in the original into direct sentences in my translation, thinking it would make an easier reading in Turkish. When translating, I make use of all kinds of dictionaries. A difficult English word for me is the word \"vision\". In To the Lighthouse, the artist Lily Briscoe is trying to finish the picture she has been drawing for some time and the novel ends with the following sentences: \"Yes, she thought, laying down her brush extremely tired, I've had my vision.\" And I'm still thinking about how to translate this remark into Turkish.

I graduated from the University of Ankara in 1941 and my four teachers, including Orphan Burian, are members of the Translation Bureau who prepared a list of works to be translated into Turkish and set themselves to translating some of these, besides shouldering the heavy work of correcting or editing the translations submitted to the Bureau. Orphan Burian, now mostly known for his translations of Shakespeare, had started to translate To the Lighthouse for the Translation Bureau, but at the same time he wanted to do something from Shakespeare. So he transferred it to me. For me, To the Lighthouse was love at first sight or rather at first reading. To translate a book, I first read it from the beginning to the end. Then I started writing each sentence by hand. When I finished the whole book I read my translation from the beginning to the end, checking it with the original, and making corrections. Then I typed it, and read the typed copy, making changes again. All in all that added up to five readings. I started translating the novel in 1943 and submitted it to the Bureau in 1944.

But you've signed a contract that says you will represent your country to the best of your ability. You've got a responsibility to your teammates. And now you just want to walk away? I will not let you be dishonorable. If you don't like gymnastics, then at the very least, you will finish the season.\" The next afternoon as I dragged myself into Chow's gym, I thought of the efforts Mom had made in order to pay for my training. I thought of my two sisters: Arielle, who gave up ballroom dancing, and Joyelle, who stopped ice skating so that our single mom could afford to keep me in gymnastics. For now, here's what you need to know: Exactly 210 days before I ever attempted my first vault   in the London Summer Olympics, my leap of faith came this close to ending in a crash of disaster.

{"answer": 1, "choices": ["South America", "Central America", "Spain.", "Africa"], "question": "Farmers grow cocoa trees in the shady areas of rainforests near the Earth's equator. These trees can be difficult to grow. They require an exact amount of water, warmth, soil and protection. After about five years, cocoa trees start producing large fruits called pods. The seeds inside these pods are harvested to make chocolate. Today we travel around the world exploring the history of chocolate. Its story begins with a plant whose scientific name, Theobroma cocoa, means \"food of the gods\". People have been enjoying the rich flavor of chocolate, a product made from this plant. Most people know that chocolate is made from cocoa and that the origins of chocolate can be traced back to Central and South America. For centuries, the natives there regarded cocoa as a gift from the gods. But how did chocolate go from being the food of the gods to being the food of love? Historians believe the Maya of Central America first learned to farm cocoa plants around two thousand years ago. The Maya took the cocoa trees from the rainforests and grew them in their gardens. They cooked the cocoa seeds, and then crushed them into a soft substance. They used the cocoa bean as the main part in a dark, bitter drink that we would call \"chocolate\". They believed that chocolate had mystical characteristics -- but cocoa also had commercial  value. In fact, cocoa beans were used as a form of currency that was worth its weight in gold! The explorer Christopher Columbus brought cocoa seeds to Spain after his trip to Central America in 1502. But the Spanish explorer Conquistador Hernando Cortez was the first European explorer to realize cocoa's commercial possibilities. When he arrived in the New World in 1519, he soon established  his own cocoa plantation. In 1529, Cortez returned to Spain and introduced chocolate -- as a drink mixed with sugar, vanilla, and cinnamon -- to European society. The wealthy people of Spain first enjoyed a sweetened type of the chocolate drink. Later, the popularity of the drink spread throughout Europe. The English, Dutch and French began to plant cocoa trees in their own colonies. Chocolate remained a drink that only wealthy people could afford to drink until the eighteenth century. During the period known as the Industrial Revolution, new technologies helped make chocolate less costly to produce.

She did have a network of close friends and family, and maybe this is what satisfied her. We, however, with so many choices and such pressure to succeed in every area, have turned happiness into one more thing we've got to have. We're so self-conscious about our \"right\" to it that it's making us miserable. So we chase it and equal it with wealth and success, without noticing that the people who have those things aren't necessarily happier. Happiness isn't about what happens to us--it's about how we see what happens to us. It's the skillful way of finding a positive for every negative.

Psychologists tell us that to be happy we need a mix of enjoyable leisure time and satisfying work.I don't think that my grandmother, who raised 14 children, had much of either. She did have a network of close friends and family, and maybe this is what satisfied her. We, however, with so many choices and such pressure to succeed in every area, have turned happiness into one more thing we've got to have. We're so self-conscious about our \"right\" to it that it's making us miserable. So we chase it and equal it with wealth and success, without noticing that the people who have those things aren't necessarily happier. Happiness isn't about what happens to us--it's about how we see what happens to us. It's the skillful way of finding a positive for every negative. It's not wishing for what we don't have, but enjoying what we do possess. People who equal happiness with wealth and success   _  .", "subject": ""}

It was my friend Lydia,upset over an argument with her husband. My usual approach is to offer advice,but this time,exhausted from chores,I simply sat down in a chair and listened to my friend's frustration  and sadness. Without the disturbance of judgment or the desire to comfort her,I stayed totally quiet while she talked. Eventually Lydia's depression eased and we said our goodbyes. The next day she phoned to thank me. \"I'm so grateful for the way you helped me through this,\"she said. At first I was surprised. After all,I had done nothing except be there for her. But after I had my own venting    experience with another friend later that evening,I realized that my focused silence had some value. In fact,most relationship experts agree that talk is cheap;it's listening that's rare and valuable It allows you not only to hear what the other person is saying,but also to have a clear understanding of her thoughts and feelings. And for the speaker,that level of understanding translates into concern and respect. Unfortunately,listening isn't as easy as it sounds. Thanks  to  schedules  filled  with  family and work,multitasking has become a barrier   to listening. My tiredness may have been the only thing stopping me from folding  laundry or checking my email while Lydia talked that afternoon. Another barrier to listening is our listening system:Most of us take in only about half of what's being said during a conversation,according to the International Listening Association. Research shows that we speak at 125 to 150 words per minute,yet think at 500 words a minute. Therefore,because we think much more quickly than we  speak,it is easy for us to lose our concentration when  listening to speakers. While it can be hard to focus at times,it's a skill worth developing. With a little practice  (employing some techniques),you can become a better listener.

{"answer": 3, "choices": ["They cannot exist in a research at the same time.", "The former one is of greater importance than the latter.", "The latter one is more scientific than the former one.", "The former is closer to the nature of scientific research."], "question": "\"Hypotheses ,\" said Medawarin 1964, \"are imaginative and inspirational in character\"; they are \"adventures of the mind\". He was arguing in favour of the position taken by Karl Popper that the nature of scientific method is hypothetico-deductive and not, as is generally believed, inductive. The myth  of scientific method is that it is inductive: that the formulation of scientific theory starts with the basic, raw evidence of the senses -- simple, fair, unprejudiced observation. Out of these sensory data -- commonly referred to as \"facts\" -- generalisations   will form. The myth is that from a disorderly collection of factual information an orderly, relevant theory will somehow come out. However, the starting point of induction is an impossible one. There is no such thing as an unprejudiced observation. Every act of observation we make is a function of what we have seen or otherwise experienced in the past. All scientific work of an experimental or exploratory nature starts with some expectation about the outcome. This expectation is a hypothesis. Hypotheses provide the motivation for the inquiry and influence the method. It is in the light of an expectation that some observations are held to be relevant and some irrelevant, that one method is chosen and others abandoned, that some experiments are conducted and others are not. Hypotheses arise by guesswork, or by inspiration, but having been started they can and must be tested thoroughly, using the appropriate method. If the predictions you make as a result of deducing certain consequences from your hypothesis are not shown to be correct then you abandon or adjust your hypothesis. If the predictions turn out to be correct then your hypothesis has been supported and may be kept until such time as some further test shows it not to be correct. Once you have arrived at your hypothesis, which is a product of your imagination, you then move on to a strictly logical and thorough process, based upon deductive argument -- therefore the term \"hypothetico-deductive\". So don't worry if you have some idea of what your results will tell you before you even begin to collect data; there are no scientists in existence who really wait until they have all the evidence in front of them before they try to work out what it might possibly mean. The hypothetico-deductive method describes the logical approach to much research work, but it does not describe the psychological behaviour that brings it about. The psychological behaviour is a much more complicated process -- involving guesses, reworkings, corrections, and above all inspiration, in the deductive as well as the hypothetic component. However, describing the logical approach is like writing the final thesis  or published papers of research work. These theses and papers have been, quite properly, organised into a more logical order so that the worth of the output may be evaluated independently of the behavioural processes by which it was obtained. It is the difference, for example between the academic papers with which Crick and Watson demonstrated the structure of the DNA molecule  and the fascinating book The Double Helix in which Watson (1968) described how they did it.

The world's biggest social media network presented documents to the Securities and Exchange Commission on Wednesday. The documents are required before the company can make its initial public offering or IPO. A date for the stock sale has yet to be announced. Experts say Facebook could raise about five billion dollars. That would be one of the biggest IPO sales ever. And it would be much bigger than Google's first public stock sale in 2004. At that time, the Internet search company raised almost two billion dollars. Facebook has 800 million users around the world. It is the second most visited website after Google. Now, experts say the social media network is in a position to become one of the most valuable Internet companies. Stock expert Anupam Palit at Greencrest Capital says that among social media sites, Facebook is in a class by itself. \"It is the biggest company in this space and we believe what makes it very unique from every other company that went public last year in this space is that it is very, very profitable.\" said Anupam Palit. Early estimates place the total value of the social network between 75 and 100 billion dollars. That includes earlier investments by other companies. David Kirkpatrick wrote the book The Facebook Effect. He says Facebook's IPO will be historic. The stock sale could also make Facebook founder Mark Zuckerberg one of the world's youngest billionaires. He is only 27. Investment companies are likely to buy Facebook stock first. But investment manager Jim O'Shaugnessy says that is not so bad. He says the prices of some IPO stocks are too high and fall not long after they first go on sale. Recently, share prices of some Internet businesses have fallen after their stocks were first offered. For example, stocks of Linkedln, Groupon and Zynga, dropped in price by as much as 25% after going public. There were similar questions eight years ago when Google first sold stock to the public.

She explained that I could use the money to buy a hot lunch from the cafeteria. I was thrilled. I never bought my lunch at the cafeteria. It was too expensive for my family, and we always carried our lunch and brought the bah back home to use again the next day. My sandwiches were either bologna or tuna fish. It rarely varied beyond that. You can understand my delight when I had the opportunity to buy a hot lunch. When we finished lunch that day, Mrs. Amatuli took me aside and said she wanted to explain why she had bought my sandwich. Oh, I couldn't wait to get home and tell my Mama that form now on I wanted tuna fish on Fridays. After my Mama understood why, she gladly fixed tuna fish for me on Friday.

She lived in darkness and silence. As she grew older, she, too, wanted to express her ideas and feelings. But she realized she was cut off from others. Her parents were greatly worried. How could anyone make touch with Helen's mind and intelligence in darkness and silence without speech? Helen was nearly seven before a teacher was found. Her name was Miss Sullivan.

However, the heaviest snowfalls have been reported in the mountains of other areas during winter. Snow is even known to fall near the Equator  ,but only on the highest mountains. Snow contains much less water than rain, but much of the water the world uses comes from snow. Melting snow provides water for rivers, electric power stations and agricultural crops. In the western United States, mountain snow provides up to seventy-five percent of all surface water supplies. Snowfall helps to protect plants and some wild animals from winter weather. Fresh snow is made largely of air trapped among the snow crystals  . Because the air has trouble moving, the movement of heat is limited. Snow also influences the movement of sound waves. The surface of the snow takes in, or absorbs, sound waves. As snow grows older or if there have been strong winds, it can become hard and flat. Then, the snow,s surface will help to send back sound waves. Snow may be beautiful, but it can be deadly. It is responsible for the deaths of hundreds of people. Many people die in traffic accidents on roads covered with snow and ice or from being seriously stuck in the winter storm. Others die from heart attacks caused by too much physical activity out in the cold. People may not be able to avoid living in areas where it snows often.

One 4-year-old American cat named Sugar definitely seems to have more than one. Sugar fell from the 19th floor of her owner's home in Boston last month and was only hurt a little on her chest. \"This story isn't much of a surprise,\" said Jake Socha, a scientist at Virginia Tech University, US, in an interview with the BBC. \"There have been lots of records of these cats surviving.\" Back in 1987, scientists studied 132 cats. All of them had been brought to a vet's clinic in New York after falling from tall buildings. Around 90 percent of these cats were alive after their fall and only 37 percent had been seriously injured. \"Being able to survive falls is a _ thing for animals that live in trees, and cats are one of them,\" said Socha. Cats have developed special body structures to survive accidental falls. Their legs are muscular. This can protect their bones from breaking, Professor Andrew Biewener from Harvard University told the BBC. Cats can also spread out their legs like a parachute to reduce their falling speed, he said. The strange part, according to scientists, is that cats have a better chance of survival if they fall from higher than seven stories. This is because cats have a good sense of which way is down. They can twist their bodies as they fall to make sure they land on their feet. A higher fall means more time for the cat to change its body position. However, you should not throw your cat out of the window to see how this works. Most pet cats are overweight nowadays. They are not fit enough to change their position in midair, warned Steve Dale, an American cat behavior scientist. \"This cat (Sugar) was lucky,\" Dale said. In fact, most cats would suffer serious lung damage, a broken leg or a broken jaw or teeth damage, he said. Which of the following statements is TRUE?", "subject": ""}
{"answer": 1, "choices": ["The group was first established in 2009.", "The group was founded by a PE teacher.", "The singers usually sing popular folk songs.", "The singers learn to sing from their parents."], "question": "In 2009, the Taiwu Elementary School Folk Singers were invited to perform in Belgium, France, Germany, and Luxemburg. In 2011, they were voted as one of the world's top five performance groups by audiences of Japan Broadcasting Corporation's Amazing Voice program. Thinking back the group's first tour in Europe, Camake Valaule, a physical education teacher and the founder of the Taiwu Elementary School Folk Singers, admitted that he felt very nervous. He was worried that the audience would fall asleep since most of the 75-minute performance was a cappella, that is, singing without instrumental sound. Surprisingly, the audience listened with full focus and high spirits. Camake said, \"They told me afterward that through our performance, they had a vision of our country, our village, without having to visit it. This experience greatly increased our confidence.\" According to Camake Valaule, singing traditional ballads has helped students and their parents to re-understand their culture. \"It used to be that the only ones who could sing these songs were tribal elders aged between 50 and 60. Now with the children performing the pieces, parents are beginning to ask, 'Why do we not know how to sing these ballads?' Many times nowadays, it is the children who teach the songs to their parents, putting back _ .\" Winning international fame, however, was neither the original intention nor the main reason why Camake founded the group in 2006. The most important thing was to make children understand why they sing these songs and to preserve and pass on their culture. Referring to the relocation of Taiwu Elementary School and Taiwu Village following Typhoon Morakot in August 2009, Camake said, \"We could not take the forest or our houses in the mountains with us; but we were able to bring our culture along. As long as the children are willing to sing, I will always be there for them, singing with them and leading them to experience the meaning of the ballads.\" Which of the following is true about Taiwu Elementary School Folk Singers?", "subject": ""}
