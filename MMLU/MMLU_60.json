The research looked at different methods of hand drying, and their effects on transfer of bacteria from the hands to other surfaces. The different methods included paper towels, traditional hand dryer, and a new model of hand dryer, which rapidly blows water from the hands. Our bodies naturally have bacteria all over them.

If the hands are still damp then these bacteria are more readily transferred to other surfaces. The researchers quantified the effects of hand drying by measuring the number of bacteria on the hands before and after different drying methods. Volunteers were asked to wash their hands and palce them onto contact plates, which were then incubated   to measure bacteria growth. The volunteers were then asked to dry their hands using either hand towels or one of the two hand dryers, with or without rubbing their hands together, and levels of bacteria were re-measured. The researchers found that rubbing the hands together while using traditional hand dryers could cancel out the reduction in bacteria numbers following hand washing.

Communication makes life extremely convenient and easy. Language plays a very important role in life as any emotion can be easily and effectively conveyed   through language to anyone. But all this is applicable and beneficial only to human beings. What about animals? How do they communicate with each other? We all know that animals do not have the ability to use language as a medium for communication. But they do have other means of conveying messages to other animals, of which use of body language is the most important one. The messages can be of many types like conveying food location, danger alarms, appreciation of good deeds like helping other animals in dangerous situations, etc. There are two main types of communication in animals: verbal   communication and non-verbal communication. Sound is one of the most common types of verbal communication in animals, and majority of the species use it as the medium to convey messages. Bats have to rely on sound waves to communicate. They mostly rest in the morning and become active at night to search for food and do other tasks. All the birds communicate through their chirping. Mammals generally make use of sounds to give calls to other members of their community. Whales are the perfect examples, which use sound waves for communication. They have a whale song, which they repeat after regular intervals. Facial Expressions This kind of communication is mostly found in dogs. When they are angry, they show their teeth and raise their ears. On the other hand, when they are frightened, they pull their ears behind and open their mouth. Also, in birds, when the parent bird brings food for the offspring, the begging expression can be observed on the offspring's face. Gestures and Body Movements This type of communication is common not only in animals, but in human beings too. All human beings, although they use language for communication, tend to use gestures and body movements as well while communicating.

Try to arrange sofas and chairs in a square around a circular table. Avoid an L-shaped arrangement as this leaves a missing corner. The centre of the living room should be left clear. Make sure there is a lot of light, which will promote good energy. Put plants in the corners of the room, as they attract good energy and will energize your health, but not ones with sharp leaves such as yuccas or cactus. Fresh flowers also bring good energy, but throw them away as soon as they begin to die, and don't have dried flowers. Mirrors are vital because they reflect energy. Round or oval ones are best, but they should not be opposite each other, nor should they reflect a door, otherwise your good fortune will go out of it. To promote harmony between the members of your family, have photos of them around the room, preferably smiling. If you want to find a partner, energize the south-west corner of your living room or bedroom by placing a floor light at least 1.75m high there, and turn it on every evening. Surround yourself with decorations and objects in pairs, such as ducks or birds. To avoid blocking the positive energy in the room, keep everything tidy. Don't accumulate too many unnecessary things. Take a look at every object, and ask yourself, \"Do I really need it? Do I really like it?\" If the answer is no, get rid of it. Your bedroom You should have the head of your bed placed against a wall, as this gives you a sense of security. Avoid having a bed under a window, as you are exposed to danger and bad energy from outside. If this is impossible, use blinds or heavy curtains to cover the window. Never sleep in a place where you can't see the door--you should always be able to see someone who's coming in. Avoid hanging pictures or lights above your bed, as this leads to a subconscious feeling of threat. Don't put mirrors opposite the bed either, as they \"break up\" the image, and therefore the relationship reflected in them. Keep lighting low and soft, and decorate preferably with dark colors. Do not hang paintings of fierce animals, abstract subjects, or water in the bedroom. Water is very good elsewhere, but in the bedroom it suggests financial loss. Make sure you never put plants in the bedroom, and don't have a TV facing the bed, or at least cover it when it is not in use. Your study Don't use the same room for your bedroom and your study, as the different energies will be in conflict. If you have to do this, try to separate the areas either symbolically with plants, or with a screen. Put away piles of files or unfinished work--don't leave them on your desk. Being tidy promotes positive energy. Wherever you study make sure your desk is in the north-east corner, especially if you are preparing for exams, as this area symbolizes education.

For years, ginger has been used to reduce the effects of nausea . But do you know it's now also being looked at to fight cancer? Scientists have discovered that ginger can kill cancerous cells in two different ways. On the one hand, ginger causes the cancer cells to \"commit suicide\" by destroying themselves while leaving the surrounding healthy cells untouched. Ginger can prevent the growth of diseased cells by destroying the environment they grow in. On the other hand, ginger tricks the diseased cells and causes them to fight among themselves. Researchers are now looking into one of the toughest cancers to fight. However, scientists find repeated treatment of disease by drugs can actually lose its effectiveness over time as the cancer builds up resistance to the same treatment. This raises researchers' confidence that ginger would help stop resistance from the cancer. In a study, the cancer clearly stopped growing in the body of the mice that had been given ginger. The bad news is that such encouraging research has only been conducted on mice. The good news, however, is that it seems humans might be able to get the same benefit just by eating products with ginger and ginger root in them. Cancer prevention and fighting abilities aren't the only potential benefits you may get from adding a bit more ginger to your diet. Drinking ginger ale when your stomach was upset as a child wasn't just a placebo .Numerous studies and research, including the Mayo Clinic's strict grading system, agree that ginger has some sort of anti-nausea characteristics. Some believe that ginger works well against nausea after operations, while others use it to reduce motion sickness such as seasickness and car sickness. The Mayo Clinic, however, advises the use of ginger only to reduce nausea during pregnancy. While more research needs to be done, early studies are very promising, especially in that small amounts of ginger don't seem to do any harm to the mother or baby. Other health benefits from ginger exist as well. Since ginger is often considered to be useful in warming bodies, it can improve the condition of people's joints including knees and ankle joints. Some suggest that ginger can help cure a cough associated with the common cold. Another benefit of ginger is that it seems to have no real side effects, which is one of the main reasons it appears to be safe during pregnancy. But for safety, you should always consult a doctor for instructions on daily use before starting, even with something like ginger that seems to have little to no side effects.

A silver lining to a depressing, rain-hit Wimbledon, she has raised heated passion.     Nobody was complaining, though, for the 1.83-metre Sharapova has created a welcome wave of interest in tennis, something missing in recent years.

Playing tennis of the highest quality throughout, the Russian's triumph not only lifted the tournament from fits of rain-induced depression but also salvaged(;) the season for the woman's tour.      Sharapova was given no easy ride in the tournament, having to beat 1999 champion Lindsay Davenport in the semifinals and twice-champion Serena Williams for the title. Neither caused her much concern.     \"I don't remember too much about the final,\" Sharapova giggled. \"I was in my own place.\"     She will find it increasingly hard to find any place to call her own from now on after advertisers identified her as the most marketable woman in sport.     In Russia she is sensational news. She headlined the news bulletins and was telephoned by former Russian President Boris Yeltsin after her triumph.    Sharapova will return to her adoptive Florida home knowing life will never be the same again.     But the girl who arrived in the US aged seven with her father and just US$700 is determined not to let fame and riches detract from her number one love, tennis.     \"I know things will start coming up and that many more things will want to get involved, but I want to keep my head cool and play tennis,\" she said.

She got out to open a metal gate that blocked her path. That's when she heard the whistle sounded by the driver of a train. Her Renault Clio was parked across a railway line. Seconds later, she watched the train drag her car almost a kilometre down the railway tracks. Ceely's near miss made the news because she blamed it on her GPS  . She had never driven the route before. It was dark and raining heavily. Ceely was relying on her GPS, but it made no mention of the crossing. \"I put my complete trust in the device and it led me right into the path of a speeding train.\" she told the BBC. Who is to blame here? Rick Stevenson, who tells Ceely's story in his book When Machines Fail Us, points the finger at the limitations of technology. We put our faith in digital devices, he says, but our digital helpers are too often not up to the job. They are filled with small problems. And it's not just GPS devices: Stevenson takes us on a tour of digital disasters involving everything from mobile phones to wireless keyboards. The problem with his argument in the book is that it's not clear why he only focuses on digital technology, while there may be a number of other possible causes. A map-maker might have left the crossing off a paper map. Maybe we should blame Ceely for not paying attention. Perhaps the railway authorities are at fault for poor signalling system. Or maybe someone has studied the relative dangers and worked out that there really is something specific wrong with the GPS equipment. But Stevenson doesn't say. It's a problem that runs through the book. In a section on cars, Stevenson gives an account of the advanced techniques that criminals use to defeat computer-based locking systems for cars. He offers two independent sets of figures on car theft; both show a small rise in some parts of the country. He says that once again not all new locks have proved reliable. Perhaps, but maybe it's also due to the shortage of policemen on the streets. Or changing social circumstances. Or some combination of these factors. The game between humans and their smart devices is amusing and complex. It is shaped by economics and psychology and the cultures we live in. Somewhere in the mix of those forces there may be a way for a wiser use of technology. If there is such a way, it should involve more than just an awareness of the shortcomings of our machines.

We can see differences when we pay attention to the way words are used. Let's look at the words about animals and plants. Most expressions in Chinese about the dog, for example, \"a homeless dog\", \"a mad dog\", \"a running dog\" and \"a dog catching a mouse\", have negative meanings. But in western countries, dogs are thought to be honest and good friends of humans. In English, people use the dog to describe positive actions. For example, \"you are a lucky dog\" means you are a lucky person. And \"every dog has its day\" means each person has good luck sometimes. To describe a person's serious illness, they say \"sick as a dog\". The word \"dog-tired\" means very tired. However, Chinese love cats very much. But in western culture, \"cat\" is often used to describe a woman who is cruel. There are many other examples of how \"cat\" is used differently as well.

{"answer": 2, "choices": ["his father was making and mending pots and kettles", "Bunyan had poor and mean early surroundings", "the rich usually got their wealth in dishonest ways", "Bunyan studied the Bible to save the human souls"], "question": "British writer John Bunyan was born at Elstow, Bedfordshire, England, in November, 1628. His father was a maker and mender of pots and kettles, and the son followed the same trade. Though he is usually called a tinker, Bunyan had a settled home and place of business. He had little schooling, and he describes his early surroundings as poor and mean. He became much interested in religions, but it was only after a tremendous spiritual conflict, lasting three or four years, that he found peace. His struggles are related with extraordinary vividness and intensity in his \"Grace Abounding to the Chief of Sinners.\" His writing began with a controversy against the Quakers  , and shows from the first the command of a homely but vigorous style. Like most working men at the time, Bunyan had a deep hatred for the corrupted, hypocritical rich who accumulated their wealth \"by hook and by crook.\" As a stout Puritan , he had made a conscientious study of the Bible and firmly believed in salvation   through spiritual struggle. Bunyan's style was modeled after that of the English Bible. With his concrete and living language and carefully observed and vividly presented details, he made it possible for the reader of the least education to share the pleasure of reading his novel and to relive the experience of his characters. Bunyan's works include Grace Abounding to the Chief of Sinners (1666), The Life and Death of Mr. Badman (1680), The Holy War (1682) and The Pilgrim's Progress (1684). The Pilgrim's Progress is the most successful religious allegory   in the English language. Its purpose is to urge people to observe Christian doctrines and seek salvation through constant struggle with their own weaknesses and all kinds of social evils. It is not only about something spiritual but also bears much relevance to the time. Its predominant metaphor -- life as a journey -- is simple and familiar. The objects that Christian meets are homely and commonplace, and the scenes presented are typical English ones, but throughout the allegory a spiritual significance is added to the commonplace details. Here the strange is combined with the familiar and the trivial joined to the divine, and, a rich imagination and a natural talent for storytelling also contribute to the success of the work which is at once entertaining and morally instructive. \"The Vanity Fair,\" is an excerpt from The Pilgrim's Progress. The story starts with a dream in which the author sees Christian the Pilgrim, with a heavy burden on his back, reading the Bible. When he learns from the book that the city in which he and his family live shall be burnt down in a fire, Christian tries to convince his family and his neighbors of the oncoming disaster and asks them to go with him in search of salvation, but most of them simply ignore him. So he starts off with a friend, Pliable. Pliable turns back after they stumble into a pit, the Slough of Despond. Christian struggles on by himself. Then he is misled by Mr. Wordly Wiseman and is brought back onto the right road by Mr. Evangelist. There he joins Faithful, a neighbor who has set out later but has made better progress. The two go on together through many adventures, including the great struggle with Apollyon, who claims them to be his subjects and refuse to accept their allegiance to God. After many other adventures they come to the Vanity Fair where both are arrested as alien agitators. They are tried and Faithful is condemned to death. Christian, however manages to escape and goes on his way, assisted by a new friend, Hopeful. Tired of the hard journey, they are tempted to take pleasant path and are then captured by Giant Despair.

{"answer": 1, "choices": ["Two", "Three", "Four", "Five"], "question": "LONDON--Archaeologists have discovered a smaller prehistoric  site near Britain's famous circle of standing stones at Stonehenge. Researchers have named the site \"Bluehenge\" after the color of the 27 Welsh stones that were laid to make up a path. The stones have disappeared, but the path of holes remains. The new circle, unearthed over the summer by researchers from Sheffield University, represents an important find, researchers said Saturday. The site is about a mile away from Stonehenge. Bluehenge, about 80 miles southwest of London, is believed to date back to about the time Stonehenge was built, about 5,000 years ago. Mike Parker Pearson of Sheffield University said he believed the path and stonehenge itself were linked to rituals  of life and death. Mike Parker suggested that the ancient funerary rituals began at a different circle site known as \"Wood-henge\", which represented the world of the living. The bodies of the dead were then brought down the River Avon to Bluehenge, which represented death, and were finally carried along a ceremonial route known as the Avenue to Stonehenge. Bournemouth University Professor Tim Darvill, an expert on Stonehenge, told Britain's Dail Mail that Bluehenge \"adds to the richness\" of the ancient site's story. \"This henge is very important because it forms part of the picture of ceremonial monuments in the area and puts Stonehenge into context,\" Darvill was quoted  as saying. \"It's no longer Stonehenge standing alone, but it has to be seen in context with the landscape.\" How many henges are mentioned in this passage?", "subject": ""}

That makes it the costliest medical condition in the country. Heart conditions were the second costliest condition, falling far behind menial disorders at $147 billion. Trauma and injury was third at $143 billion. \"One key finding of this study is the degree to which spending on mental health disorders in  2013 topped those on all other medical conditions, including heart conditions, trauma, and cancer. Researcher Charles Roehrig wrote in the study's conclusion. Just a decade ago, heart conditions outweighed mentd disorders. Health care costs on heart Problems were about $105 Million in 1996, with mental disordere coming in second at $79 billion. The findings are just another example of how important it is to recognize mental illness as a widespread public health issue. Nearly one in four people will experience a mental health condition at some point in his or her life. Despite this fact, though, there's still a lack of sensitivity and understanding in society--and even the medical community--when it comes to mental disorders. Research shows discrimination involved in mental health. Negative thoughts surrounding mental illness often prevent people from seeking treatment, which can have serious consequences. Data also suggests that not paying attention to mental illness can affeci a company 's bottom line. Serious mental illnesses result in about $193 billion in lost earnings per year.

The United States spent about $201 billion on mental illness in 2013, according to the new analysis published in the journal Health Affairs. That makes it the costliest medical condition in the country. Heart conditions were the second costliest condition, falling far behind menial disorders at $147 billion. Trauma and injury was third at $143 billion. \"One key finding of this study is the degree to which spending on mental health disorders in  2013 topped those on all other medical conditions, including heart conditions, trauma, and cancer. Researcher Charles Roehrig wrote in the study's conclusion. Just a decade ago, heart conditions outweighed mentd disorders. Health care costs on heart Problems were about $105 Million in 1996, with mental disordere coming in second at $79 billion. The findings are just another example of how important it is to recognize mental illness as a widespread public health issue. Nearly one in four people will experience a mental health condition at some point in his or her life. Despite this fact, though, there's still a lack of sensitivity and understanding in society--and even the medical community--when it comes to mental disorders. Research shows discrimination involved in mental health. Negative thoughts surrounding mental illness often prevent people from seeking treatment, which can have serious consequences. Data also suggests that not paying attention to mental illness can affeci a company 's bottom line. Serious mental illnesses result in about $193 billion in lost earnings per year. Lastly, the cost of mental health issues extends beyond a dollar sign, but perhaps the shocking figure in the report will finally serve as a wakeup call for those who believe psychological  conditions  aren't real issues. In other words, can we please take mental illness seriously now? What is the author5 s purpose in writing this passage?", "subject": ""}

Their potential Asian partners seem to be tripping over themselves to sign such agreements, as a low-cost route to acquiring new airliner technology. If they are not careful the two sides will end up tripping over each other the one by selling its birth-right for short-term gain, the other by trying to break into a market which isn't big enough to sustain   it.  Technology transfer works in a growing market, where the aspirations of the new entrant receiving that technology can be met through expansion. The airliner market is not such a device.  Even the most optimistic projections of airliner sales for the next 20 years show that airliner manufacture can only be profitable if a small number of aircraft builders share the available sales. It follows that if new manufacturers come into the market and take sales, their sales must come from substitution, not expansion. Given the complexity of today's airliners, it is unlikely that any new entrant will have both the financial and technical resources to come into the market without the involvement of an established manufacturer. In the short term, such involvement may not be to the exclusive benefit of the new entrant most of the established manufacturers are searching for ways to reduce costs of manufacture.  In the short term, it can be of benefit to an established Western manufacturer to have either components of complete air-frames made or assembled in lower-wage economics such as China, Taiwan or Korea, while retaining the design, development and marketing of aircraft for itself. It would be a very unwise Western manufacturer which did not notice the fact that these developing economies are acquiring skills (like computing) at least as quickly as they are acquiring skills in metal bashing  .

The father lit a match and looked at his watch. It was 10 p.m.--two hours before the season opened. He looked at the fish, then at the boy. \"You'll have to put it back, son,\" he said. \"Dad!\" cried the boy. \"There will be other fish,\" said his father. \"Not as big as this one,\" cried the boy.

When we complained about the terrible smell, Dad said the stronger the manure, the healthier the crops, and he was right. For example, just one of his cantaloupes filled the entire house with its sweet smell, and the taste was even sweeter. As the vegetables started coming in, Dad threw himself into cooking. One day, armed with a basket of vegetables, he announced he was going to make stew. Dad pulled out a pressure cooker and filled it up with cabbages, eggplants, potatoes, corns, onions and carrots. For about half an hour, the pressure built and the vegetables cooked. Finally, Dad turned off the stove, the pot began to cool and the pressure relief valve sprayed out a cloud of steam. If we thought Dad's pile of chicken manure was bad, this was 10 times worse. When Dad took off the lid, the smell nearly knocked us out.

One important form of soil conservation is the use of windbreaks. Windbreaks are barriers   formed by trees and other plants with many leaves. Farmers plant them in lines around their fields. Windbreaks stop the wind from blowing soil away. They also keep the wind from destroying or damaging crops. They are very important for growing grains, such as wheat. There have been studies done on windbreaks in parts of West Africa, for example. They found that grain harvests can be twenty percent higher in fields protected by windbreaks compared to fields without such protection. However, windbreaks seem to work best when they allow a little wind to pass through. If the wall of trees and plants stops wind completely, then violent air motions will take place close to the ground. These motions will lift soil into the air where it will be blown away.

But for much wildlife, loose dogs may be a dangerous enemy, according to a study by a biologist from Utah State University in the US. Based on much existing research and their own case studies, Julie Young of Utah State University and four other scientists conclude that loose dogs may represent a huge danger to wildlife, especially endangered species, by hunting down or worrying them and by spreading diseases. They also found that dogs, their worldwide numbers around 500 million, can cause more damage to wildlife and livestock  than wolves and other enemies of these animals. Young gave examples from the US state of Idaho, where research showed the presence of dogs reducing some deer populations. On the Navajo American Indians' reservation in northeastern Arizona, packs of loose dogs are chasing livestock. They have killed populations of small animals such as rabbits and act as a disease carrier for rabies  among people and other animals, she said. Loose dogs also were to blame for distemper outbreak leading to a die-off of endangered black-footed ferrets in northwestern Wyoming in the 1980s. The phenomenon is not just limited to US; it's a global problen. Julie Young once studied three endangered species in central Asia: wild sheep, gazelles and antelope. The rate of injury and death to these animals by loose dogs was very high. In another case, Young found that dogs, not wolves, as originally suspected, were responsible for a large number of livestock killings in the mountainous Basque country between Spain and France. Authors of the new study said the problem is likely to worsen as communities expand. Then how to deal with it? Indeed, in many countries, leash  laws permit punishment of dog owners whose pets chase wildlife. But lawbreakers are rarely punished because the police lack both people and money.

But for much wildlife, loose dogs may be a dangerous enemy, according to a study by a biologist from Utah State University in the US. Based on much existing research and their own case studies, Julie Young of Utah State University and four other scientists conclude that loose dogs may represent a huge danger to wildlife, especially endangered species, by hunting down or worrying them and by spreading diseases. They also found that dogs, their worldwide numbers around 500 million, can cause more damage to wildlife and livestock  than wolves and other enemies of these animals. Young gave examples from the US state of Idaho, where research showed the presence of dogs reducing some deer populations. On the Navajo American Indians' reservation in northeastern Arizona, packs of loose dogs are chasing livestock. They have killed populations of small animals such as rabbits and act as a disease carrier for rabies  among people and other animals, she said. Loose dogs also were to blame for distemper outbreak leading to a die-off of endangered black-footed ferrets in northwestern Wyoming in the 1980s. The phenomenon is not just limited to US; it's a global problen. Julie Young once studied three endangered species in central Asia: wild sheep, gazelles and antelope. The rate of injury and death to these animals by loose dogs was very high. In another case, Young found that dogs, not wolves, as originally suspected, were responsible for a large number of livestock killings in the mountainous Basque country between Spain and France. Authors of the new study said the problem is likely to worsen as communities expand. Then how to deal with it? Indeed, in many countries, leash  laws permit punishment of dog owners whose pets chase wildlife. But lawbreakers are rarely punished because the police lack both people and money. Young has low-cost solutions to the problem for dog lovers, though. They include public dog-training programs and vaccinating   dogs against rabies and other illnesses. .

Wind and energy from the sun are generally considered clean, unlike energy from coal-burning power stations. However, environmentalists now worry that too much solar power development could harm the local environment. A California company -- BrightSource Energy is building a huge solar power plant in the Mojave desert, about 60 kilometers southwest of Las Vegas, Nevada. The plant is known as the Ivanpah Solar Electric Generating System. Joe Desmond works for the company. \"This is actually one of the highest concentrations of sunlight in the world, out here in Ivanpah.\" explained Desmond. BrightSource Energy will deploy 170,000 specially designed mirrors to direct solar energy towards boilers on top of three power towers. The steam produced in the boilers will drive turbine   to make electricity. Joe Desmond says the steam can reach temperatures of more than 260 degrees Celsius. \"We can store the sun's thermal energy in the form of molten salt, so we can produce electricity even when the sun goes down. There is a lot of interest in concentrating solar power around the globe in environmnents where you have lots of sun, such as China, South Africa, the Middle East, North Africa, explained Desmond. Environmentalists generally support the idea of solar power, however, many are concerned about the effect of power plants on sensitive environment. Lisa Belenky is a lawyer with the Center for Biological Diversity, a private group. She says environmentalists are specifically worried about the effect of the Ivanpah Solar Project on the sensitive plant and animal life in that part of Mojave desert. \"Even though the desert seems big, when you start cutting it up, it can really affect how the species and the animals and the plants are able to survive in the long run,\"said Lisa Belenky. BrightSource Energy has already spent more than $ 50 million to move endangered desert tortoises away from the power plant. but Lisa Belenky says this is not the answer. \"We should be reusing areas that have a1ready been disturbed, like old mining sites, for example...either on homes, on businesses, parking lots.\" said Belenky. There have also been reports of birds dying at the Ivanpah Plant and others like it. Some birds die after colliding with solar equipment which the animals mistake for water.

When I was a little kid I hated green beans. But my mom said I couldn't leave the table until I ate ten green beans. All alone at the table, I stared at the green beans for what seemed like hours. It was a mountain of green beans. I couldn't do it. My grandma came to me and asked if I could eat one green bean. \"But Grandma, I have to eat ten!\" She said all I had to do was to eat one green bean. One tiny little green bean. So I ate one. It was bad, but not as bad as I'd thought it would be. Then she asked me again if I could eat one. So I ate one green bean nine more times. My grandma doesn't know about the envelopes, but she tells me anyone can do one thing every day. Back in my room, I lay down on the bed. Just like I used to do when I was a little kid, I hang my head down to look at the pile of envelopes. There it is. But instead of a monster, I see a pile of green beans. Who's afraid of green beans?

{"answer": 3, "choices": ["his machine", "money", "language", "politeness"], "question": "Once upon a time there was a crook who only thought about how to get money. What he hated most was when people were polite to each other, saying things like \"please\", \"thank you\", and \"don't mention it\". The crook thought all those kinds of words were a waste, so he spent a lot of time inventing a machine which could steal words. With this machine, he planned to steal \"please\", \"thank you\", \"don't mention it\", and similar words people used to be polite. After he stole these words, he intended to take them apart and sell the letters to book publishers. After he started up his machine, people would open their mouths, intending to say kind and polite things, but nothing came out. All those words ended up inside the big machine. The crook was happy with his success, but he didn't count on  a couple of very special little girls. Those girls were deaf, and had to communicate with sign language. Because the machine couldn't steal gestures, these girls continued being kind and polite. Soon they realized what had been happening to everyone else, and they found out about the crook and his plan. The girls followed him and found the machine busy separating all the words into letters. They approached the machine and started being polite to each other. Try as it might, the machine couldn't steal those words, and it started to suffer a power overload . Finally, it exploded, sending all the letters it had gathered flying into the sky.

Air-conditioning began to spread in industries as a production aid during World War II. Today most Americans need to take air-conditioning for granted to homes, offices, factories, theatres, shops, studios, schools, hotels, and restaurants, and we can see it almost everywhere in today's America. But not everybody is aware that high cost and easy comfort are merely two of the effects of the vast cooling of American. In fact, air conditioning has substantially altered the country's character and customs. Many of the byproducts are so conspicuous  that they are scarcely noticed. To begin with, air-conditioning transformed the face of America by making possible those glassy, boxy, sealed-in skyscrapers. It has been indispensable, no less, to the functioning of sensitive advanced computers, whose high operating temperatures require that they be constantly cooled. . . It has, at will, forced families into going back into families with closed doors and shut windows to improve the effects of the air-conditioning, reducing the interactions of neighborhood life. I think there is no need explaining the seriousness of this consequence . It is really surprising that the public's often noted withdrawal into self-pursuit and privacy has kept in pace with the historic spread of air-conditioning. Though science has little studied how habitual air-conditioning affects mind and body, some medical experts suggest that, like other technical avoidance of natural changes in climate, air-conditioning may damage the human capacity to adapt to stress. If so, air-conditioning is only like many other greatly useful technical developments that liberate  man from nature by increasing his productivity and power in some way - while indirectly weakening him in others.

In fact, air conditioning has substantially altered the country's character and customs. Many of the byproducts are so conspicuous  that they are scarcely noticed. To begin with, air-conditioning transformed the face of America by making possible those glassy, boxy, sealed-in skyscrapers. It has been indispensable, no less, to the functioning of sensitive advanced computers, whose high operating temperatures require that they be constantly cooled. . . It has, at will, forced families into going back into families with closed doors and shut windows to improve the effects of the air-conditioning, reducing the interactions of neighborhood life. I think there is no need explaining the seriousness of this consequence . It is really surprising that the public's often noted withdrawal into self-pursuit and privacy has kept in pace with the historic spread of air-conditioning. Though science has little studied how habitual air-conditioning affects mind and body, some medical experts suggest that, like other technical avoidance of natural changes in climate, air-conditioning may damage the human capacity to adapt to stress.

{"answer": 2, "choices": ["Because daybreak is the coldest time of the day in the mountain.", "Because it often snows heavily in the mountains at daybreak.", "Because temperature changes at daybreak.", "Because the top layer snow is loose at daybreak."], "question": "Avalanches   are one of those natural disasters that can cause great damage and only Mother Nature knows when and where they are going to occur. Even with modern technology it is still impossible to know exactly when or where one is going to occur. Mountain climbers are wise to be careful, as avalanches kill many of them each year.  The physics of how and why an avalanche occurs is complex. There are times of higher probability. During the year, the transition( from winter to spring will cause some snow and ice to melt, which may trigger avalanches. Also at daybreak there is a higher probability due to the temperature change . While climbers hike up slopes, some distance between the climbers should be kept. If an avalanche occurs, then there will be fewer lives lost and a higher probability that someone will be able to seek help. Since an accident is more likely to happen when a top layer of snow is loose, avoid areas where heavy snow or rain has recently occurred.  Try to choose areas that you are familiar with and stay in areas with rocks, bushes and trees. Trees and bushes allow snow to pile up and keep the layers stable. If an avalanche occurs, trees will take the impact of the snow, so there is a better chance of being safe.  Climbers must pay attention to the degree of the slope. Avalanches won't occur on level ground and there is little snowfall on very steep areas. The greatest danger is in areas where the slope is between 25 and 40 degrees.  Remember that, if you get stuck in an avalanche, there is no car hire available to take you to the nearest airport. Why is there a higher probability that an avalanche occurs at daybreak?", "subject": ""}

Only scientists recognized its high food value.During the Second World War, when meat was in short supply, the US government encouraged the American people to eat soybean products.However, they never became very popular and, after the war, interest in them dropped off as the supply of meat became plentiful again. In recent years, people in the West have become increasingly aware of the dangers of eating too much animal fat, and as a result, they have turned more and more to soybean products. This is mainly because the soybean provides almost the same food value as meat, and in addition it is a lot more healthful. Much of the margarine   ,salad oil and cooking oil in daily use is now produced from soybean oil.Tofu, a representative soybean product and originally one of the main foods in the diet of Chinese priests, is considered to be one of the healthiest foods available to man. The Western people become interested in tofu and other soybean products because_.", "subject": ""}

{"answer": 0, "choices": ["The origins of theater.", "The role of ritual in modern dance.", "The importance of storytelling.", "The variety of early religious activities."], "question": "There are many theories about the beginning of drama in ancient Greece. The one most widely accepted today is based on the assumption that drama came from ritual  . The argument for this view goes as follows. In the beginning, human beings viewed the natural forces of the world, even the seasonal changes, as unpredictable, and they sought through various means, to control these unknown and feared powers. Those measures which appeared to bring the desired results were then kept and repeated until they hardened into fixed rituals. Eventually stories arose which explained the mysteries of the rites. As time passed some rituals were abandoned, but the stories, later called myths  , coutinued to exist and provided material for art and drama. Those who believe that drama came from ritual also argue that those rites contained the seed of theater because music, dance, masks, and costumes were almost always used. Furthermore, a suitable site had to be provided for performances and when the entire community did not participate, a clear division was usually made between the \"acting area\" and the \"watching area.\" In addition, there were performers, and, since considerable importance was attached to avoiding mistakes in performing, religious leaders usually undertook that task. Wearing masks and costumes, they often imitated other people, animals, or supernatural beings, and used gestures about the desired effect, success in hunt or battle, the coming rain, the revival   of the Sun. Eventually such dramatic representations were separated from religious activities. Another theory traces the theater's origin from the human interest in storytelling. According to this view, tales about the hunt, war, or other feats are gradually added in detail, at first through imitation, action, and dialogue by a narrator and then through the assumption of each of the roles by a different person.

Legare, a professor at the University of Texas. Ms. Legare brought in 96 children aged 3 to 5 and set before them a complex toy made up of colorful, interlocking gears  . With the first group, the researchers asked, \"Can you explain this to me?\" With the second one, they said, \"Look, isn't this interesting?'' The two groups of children focused on different things, researchers found. Children who were asked to observe noticed the colors of the toy, while those asked to explain focused on the chain of gears working on each other. Children who had explained the toy were better at re-creating it and not being disturbed by decorative gears, and they were better able to use what they had learned who had observed the toy outperformed the children in the explanation group on a memory task focused on the toy's colors. Dedre Gentner, the director of the cognitive science program at Northwestern University, said that teachers introducing a concept can improve students' understanding  by  giving examples of close comparisons,  and then asking children to explain how concepts are related. In a series of experiments with 3-to 7-year-olds, she focus children can be con be confused by comparisons that focus on a relationship rather than a direct-object match. For example, a 3-year-old shown a picture of two rabbits facing each other and told \"this is a toma '' and then asked to find another \"tome\" will choose a picture of a rabbit over one of two cats facing each other 98 percent of the time. A 7-year-old is more likely to recognize the more abstract comparison of a relationship. However, Ms. Gentner found that 3-year-olds can think more like 7-yesr-olds if they are given more examples.

On a visit to his home I heard him say, \"People need to decide to be happy.\" I pressed him. \"What do you mean by that?\" His face took on an skeptical look. \"You have to ask me?\" At that moment I felt a little foolish. Complex human problems, at least to me, often prevent people from being happy. To Marty it was a matter of common sense. I wondered, what was I missing? That night Marty told me a story that was very personal for him. I knew Marty and Mickey had four children. I didn't know there had been a fifth. She was their second child. She died shortly after birth.  \"The funeral director was a super guy,\" Marty said. \"He knew we didn't have any money, but he told us he would take care of our little girl. He went out and built a wood casket   for her.\" Marty's voice started to break. \"He only charged us five dollars. It's stuff like that. You can look for the good in people and you'll find the good. You can look for the bad in people and you'll find the bad.\" I didn't know what it was like to grow up poor. Marty's life was filled with minimum-wage jobs, borrowing on insurance policies, and working overtime to make a little more money.  In my lifetime I had seen people in similar circumstances grow angry. Bitterness took hold of their lives and choked them. \"I never had much money, and I don't think I ever will.\" Marty said. \"People think they need to have a lot of things to make them happy. They ought to look around and see what's really important.\" When Marty looked around, he saw the most beautiful girl in the world as his wife, four children who loved him, a home he took pride in, and a job that made him feel alive. He was happy because, in his mind, he had it all. What would be the best title for the text?", "subject": ""}

He thought he saw something. Then he slowed down, watching out for children rushing out from between parked cars. As his car passed, no kids appeared. Instead, a brick smashed into his door! He slammed on the brakes (make his car stop). The angry driver then jumped out of his car, caught the nearest child and pushed him up against a parked car, shouting, \"Who are you and what was that all about?\" The little boy was full of apology, \"Please,Mister... Please, I'm sorry...I didn't know what else I could do. I threw the brick because no one else would stop.\" With tears dripping down his face, the youth pointed to a spot just around a parked car. \"It's my brother,\" he said. \"He fell out of his wheelchair and I can't lift him up.\" Now weeping, the boy asked the executive, \"Would you please help me to get him back into his wheelchair? He's hurt and he's too heavy for me.\" Touched beyond words, the executive tried to swallow the rapidly swelling lump in his throat. He hurriedly lifted the boy back into the wheelchair, then took out his fancy handkerchief and dabbed (a light touch) at the fresh scrapes and cuts.

It must be about something which both people have the same opinion about. The purpose of small talk is to let both people agree on something. This makes meeting people easier and more comfortable.

The all-knowing Google search engine is within easy reach. So how can a teacher handle such a large number of examinees so far away, let alone searching out cheaters taking tests across the Internet? Using technology, of course. While special services via webcam   and cheating detecting software have been developed now, Mettl, an online company, has developed advanced techniques for netting cheaters, which the company claims are even more reliable and easier to use. Whatever small attempt to cheat, he or she will be found out. Mettl has adopted a mass of technologies on its test-taking platform, creating a mini monitoring state in an exam. Here's how it works: A test-taker signs on to Mettl and selects his/her exam from the site's library of pre-loaded tests. Facial and keystroke recognition technology confirm the person that has signed in is the very person, and the system records both the test-taker (through the webcam) and the test-taker's screen throughout the test. Mettl's technology uses the test-taker's webcam to detect how many people are using the computer. Soon, it will track eye movement well enough to sense whether the test-taker is looking away from the screen, perhaps to consult a smart phone or a friend in secret. Mettl also monitors the test-taker's screen and can detect when the test-taker has changed a computer or moved from the test. The system will soon be able to record sound, detecting whether the test-taker is talking or being talked to. If any wrongdoings are detected, the system flags the incident and reports it back to the test's administrator. This can bring any number of things, depending on the test-giver's wishes: a complete shutdown of the exam, a warning message that appears on the test-taker's screen, even human instructions from the control center.

But the mother or father who explains reasonably to a child , \"Peter was crying because you hit him,\" is not likely to attract much attention. Young children need to be scolded immediately, and strongly, before they'll take criticism  to heart. When your young child does something wrong, scold him or her seriously at once. At the same time be sure to tell the child clearly what he or she has done wrong. An angry reaction without an immediate explanation does little good. Forbidding a child to play outside or not allowing him to watch TV as a punishment works well-but only when taken together with an explanation. Make sure your child understands that although his or her wrongdoing has made you angry, you still love him or her. Use simple, direct words such as, \"You hurt peter. How would you feel if he hit you? You must never, never hurt people.\" If your voice expresses strong feeling clearly, your message will carry enough weight.

Only after 8 p.m. can foreign cartoons appear on TV, it requires. The regulation has been issued to local TV stations but the administration has not made it public, according to the newspaper. Cartoon programs co-produce by domestic and foreign producers will have to get approval from SARFT to show during 5 p.m. and 8 p.m. from Sept.1. The first foreign cartoon introduced to Chinawas a Japanese cartoon called \"Astro Boy\" series in 1981. Since then, a large quantity of foreign cartoons _ China. Incomplete surveys show about 80 percent of interviewed Chinese children like foreign cartoons according to the Southern Metropolis News. With the effects of regulations and establishment of 15 film and cartoon production bases in recent years, domestic cartoon industry attracted huge civil investment, resulting in a sharp rise of cartoon programs in 2005. However, due to the poor popularity among children, domestic cartoons found it hard to show during \"golden hours\", and even had troubles to get back the production costs. Moreover, it was the content of domestic cartoons that lost the audience, said the editorial, therefore improving the creation environment of cartoon makers is much wiser than such market-protecting measures. Finally it said it was reasonable and necessary to introduce system into the cartoon competition to protect the domestic industry, the complete prohibition of foreign cartoons and compulsory screening of domestic ones during popular hours was rather unreasonable. \"This is a worrying, short-sighted policy and would not solve the fundamental problems in China's cartoon industry,\" it concluded. Why does Chinaban foreign cartoons \"in golden hours'?", "subject": ""}

While you're sleeping, your brain is forming new pathways to help you learn and remember information. Although we all know the importance of getting a good night's sleep, not all of us know the best way of getting it. A sleep expert, Phil Atherton, gave some top tips for getting the most out of the night, which will leave you ready for action in the morning. According to Phil Atherton, not eating a large meal before bedtime is important for getting a good night's sleep. The time difference between eating and sleeping should be at least three hours. So you'd better avoid eating any food three hours before bed, as it will lower your blood sugar during sleep and help minimize damage from too much sugar floating around. It's also important to find ways to prepare your body for sleep. You can follow a routine like trying not to expose yourself to too much artificial light within 1 hour before bed, as your brain uses light to help set internal \"body clock\". Although it might seem unnatural to schedule your sleep, the purpose is to send a signal to your body and mind that it's time to sleep. Another way to prepare your body for sleep is to get into a relaxed state by taking a bath or listening to soft music. Both of them will help to take the mind off the daytime pressures.

What was on your mind? Most likely, you were thinking about finals or the holidays, although in this city I've noticed that thinking about the holiday is a fancy way of saying how much stuff will I get. Now reflect on your thoughts for this holiday season. Most people are still thinking about the holidays, but I say that with a grain of salt. Everybody with a functioning brain and the ability to communicate knows that this holioday season comes with a pretty large price tag: the debt of all the hardships, both domestic and foreign, that we've faced over the past 12months. Let's face it: some of us will get everything we want over the holidays. But there are others whose parents have lost their jobs or who have lost jobs themselves because of the current economic situation. As much as we try to ignore it, there is still economic unrest in the blue and gold suburb. In this situation, we have three options. One: We ignore the situation, like we seem to do for every bad thing that happens around us, because by God, it's the American Way! Two: We recognize that our economy is shot, feel bad about it and spend our time wishing for the good old days. Three: We recognize that our economy is shot, but instead of moping, reflect on every good thing that we have going for us. Now, which option sounds best to you? I spent a week this summer working in and around New York City with the city's homeless population. Or so I thought. Although a lot of the people I served were in fact homeless, a significant number of them had a job or a home or both. The truth of the importance of this situation is that they and thousands of others across the country can't afford even the most basic things of life, even while working two jobs. Yet no one that I met complained about their hardships. Instead, they took whatever I happened to give them(which was, more often than enough, not enough) and were genuinely grateful for what they had. Wrap your heads around that statement for a second. These people worked their butts off to stay alive with minimal results, yet were overjoyed by a flimsy  paper plate with donated green beans on it. Although I am ashamed to admit it( both as a girthy figure and an affluent citizen), I have taken for granted most of my meals, let alone green beans, and I know for a fact that I am not alone. 64.

Straightforward Teacher Program This is one of the most popular and unique scholarships available for students working towards becoming teachers. The foundation offers their scholarships every three months as opposed to each year. During each payment, four students receive a $500 scholarship.  Prezell Robinson Scholarship Program While this scholarship is available only to students in the state of North Carolina, it is so incredibly helpful that many students choose to study in the state for the only purpose of receiving it. It is offered to college students who come from low-income high schools or families that are interested in pursuing a long term career in education at any level.  New York State Scholarship Program Officials in the state of New York founded this program to award students who want to give back to their community through their ability to teach. The catch for this scholarship is that the students must be pursuing a teaching career in mathematics or science at the secondary level.  Also, because the program was designed to improve the education system in New York, the candidates must sign a service contract agreeing to work full time within the state for at least five years after graduation.  Coca-Cola Scholarships You may have many opportunities for grants and scholarships through The Coca Cola Foundation. There is the Coca Cola Teaching Foundation that will provide free money for students pursuing an education in the teaching field. This is the most obvious for teachers, but do not be afraid to check out their other offers.  Funds For Teachers Not all scholarships or grants are for students entering or already in college. The Funds for Teachers scholarships are for graduates who are already working in the field, but want to improve their possibilities, skills and education in an effort to increase their ability to teach the students that cross their path more effectively.

New York State Scholarship Program Officials in the state of New York founded this program to award students who want to give back to their community through their ability to teach.

In fact, writers responded to the railroads as soon as the first were built in the 1830's. By the 1850's, the railroad was a major presence in the life of the nation. Writers such as Ralph Waldo Emerson and Henry David saw the railroad both as a boon  to democracy  and as an object of suspicion. The railroad could be and was a despoiler  of nature, furthermore, in its manifestation of speed and noise. _ might be a despoiler of human nature as well. By the 1850's and 1860's, there was a great distrust among writer and intellectuals of the rapid industrialization of which the railroad was a leading force. Deeply philosophical historians such as Henry Adams lamented the role that the new frenzy for business was playing in eroding traditional values. A distrust of industry and business continued among writers throughout the rest of the nineteenth century and into the twentieth.

If you have a fear of failure, you might be uncomfortable setting goals. But goals help us decide where we want to go in life. Without goals, we have no sure destination. Many experts recommend visualization  as a powerful tool for goal setting. Imagining how life will be after you've reached your goal is a great motivator to keep you moving forward. However, visualization might produce the opposite results in people who have a fear of failure. In his article, researcher Thomas Langens showed that people who have a fear of failure were often left in a strong negative mood  after being asked to visualize goals and goal attainment. So, what can you do instead? Start by setting a few small goals. These should be goals that are slightly, but not overwhelmingly, challenging. Think of these goals as \"early wins\" that are designed to help improve your confidence. For example, if you've been too afraid to talk to the new department head (who has the power to give you the promotion you want), then make this your first goal: Plan to stop by her office during the next week to introduce yourself. Or, imagine that you've dreamed of returning to school to get your MBA , but you're convinced that you're not smart enough to be accepted into business school. Set a goal to talk with a school counselor or admissions officer to see what's required for admission. Try to make your goals tiny steps on the route to much bigger goals.

He and other scientists wanted to find a source of fuel that poor people in rural areas of developing countries could use to make electricity. The United Nations Development Program says a billion and a half people have no electricity. A billion others have an undependable supply. Professor DeBolt went on a study trip to rural Indonesia. He saw that there was very little waste in the use of agricultural products. Everything that farmers grew was used for something. Even the remains of fruit that people did not eat were fed to chickens. Little waste meant there was little that could be used for fuel. Growing a separate fuel crop would take land away from food crops. That was something Professor DeBolt did not want to do. DeBOLT said, \"The people at most risk with respect to energy poverty, typically they're the same people who have food insecurity issues as it is. And then any change in availability would be most damaging to that group of people.\" But he found one item that was in plentiful supply and would not create competition between food and fuel. Coconut shells are generally thrown out. Yet Professor DeBolt says it has an \"excellent\" heating value. All someone needs is a way to release that energy.

{"answer": 1, "choices": ["are from the rival sides for sure", "probably intended to make money", "are involved in gambling", "knew a winning mentality for a team is important"], "question": "There are many sorts of spies. There are those employed by governments to protect their countries' interests; there are those we find in fiction and film, like the famous James Bond; and then there are the spies of the business world. But now there is a new form of espionage  : sports spying. It may be a profitable job - if the spy can find a buyer for the information. Last week, British newspapers reported that the England national team had been secretly recorded by an unknown group of individuals. Media suggested that _ had picked up a discussion of team tactics  , as well as playful talk about athletes' affairs and possible rewards for players if they manage to win the World Cup. England officials immediately filed a suit to stop media from publishing the contents of the recordings. Little is known about the identities of the spies, but authorities doubt they have any connection to rival sides preparing for this summer's competition in South Africa. Rather, it appears that the people who bugged the hotel meeting room are just after money. If they find the right buyer, they could get a lot of it. Gambling in major sports, like football, involves much more than picking the winner of a particular match. People can also place bets on starting line-ups, the timing of substitutions and goals scored. Knowing a team's tactics for a particular game, or for a series of games, can help gamblers to increase their chances of winning big money. England manager Fabio Capello tried to play down the importance of game tactics. He argued that a team's psychological preparation is the most vital. \"It's more important to train the mind, to find confidence, create a group and a winning mentality,\" he said. Perhaps of more interest to the casual fan are the discussions of the players' relationships with wives and girlfriends. UK newspapers may be prevented from publishing the details, but some Britons might say, the chances of the recordings never being heard are about as good as those of England winning this year's competition: slim to none.

Probably the best example is the rush to produce ethanol  for fuel from corn. Corn is a renewable resource --you can harvest it and grow more, almost limitlessly. So replacing gas with corn ethanol seems like a great idea. One might get a bit more energy out of the ethanol than that used to make it, which could still make ethanol more sustainable than gas generally, but that's not the end of the problem. Using corn to make ethanol means less corn is left to feed animals and people, which drives up the cost of food. That result leads to turning the fallow land -including, in some cases, rain forest in places such as Brazil--into farmland, which in turn gives off lots of carbon dioxide (CO) into the air. Finally, over many years, the energy benefit from burning ethanol would make up for the forest loss. But by then, climate change would have progressed so far that _ might not help. You cannot really declare any practice \"sustainable\" until you have done a complete life-cycle analysis of its environmental  costs.

Many owners added a second floor or even more floors to their houses, especially in buildings near main streets, in order to rent more apartments and make more money. Zhang, the historian, said that to better protect the hutong, the government should offer more compensation to residents willing to move away. Guo Dazhi, a photojournalist in Beijing, lived in a hutong for nearly 30 years before moving to eastern Chaoyang district.

Snowden has taken sanctuary   in Russia, a country that, under the guidance of President Vladimir Putin, a former Soviet KGB officer, has been sliding ever deeper back into dictatorship  . The Federal Security Service (FSB) has invested in technology that allows it to monitor telephone and Internet communications and to collect and store not just metadata -- information about call destinations and lengths -- but also the content of communications. The Russian state uses that technology to engage in essentially unchecked surveillance of telephone calls, e-mail traffic, blogs, and Web sites. Over the past two years \"the Kremlin has transformed Russia into a surveillance state -- at a level that would have made the KGB envious.\"   If Snowden's objective is to give people a voice in how they are governed, and to expose massive uncontrolled surveillance, he could speak out about practices of the Russian government that go far beyond anything ever undertaken by the U.S. government.  For better or for worse, Snowden has a large number of supporters around the world. His words are listened to by millions -- so he could make a difference where it counts. Yet he has been silent about the surveillance surrounding him. Why? Is he being polite to his hosts? Does he have concerns about what the FSB might do in response to what he might say?  Whatever the answer, Snowden's silence about the dictatorship where he has taken sanctuary is telling. It is yet more evidence, if evidence were needed, that he is not a whistleblower at all. It suggests that, instead of being a brave speaker of truths, he is a hypocrite  , with principles that he applies selectively against the justice he has betrayed .

A study of 192 third and fourth grades, generally aged eight and nine, found that children who cut the number of hours spent watching television gained nearly two pounds (0.91 kg) less over a one-year period than those who did not change their television diet. \"The findings are important because they show that weight loss can only be the result of a reduction in television viewing and not any other activity,\" said Thomas Robinson, a pediatrician  at Stanford University. \" American children spend an average of more than four hours per day watching television and videos or playing games, and rates of childhood being very fat have doubled over the past 20 years,\" Robinson said. In the study, presented this week to the Pediatric Academic Societies' annual meeting in San Francisco, the researchers persuaded about 100 of the students to reduce their television viewing by one-quarter to one-third.

In the morning I went to the gym, and unsuccessfully got the phone call from the unemployment office for some job searching. Before I knew it, it was noon. I grabbed a quick lunch and rushed down to a meeting. On my way to Connecticut, I wondered if I would see someone that I would feel forced to give my first $10 to. I was running late and decided to do it afterwards. After the meeting I had about half an hour to find the first person of my Year of Giving! I decided to check out Dupont Circle. I had met a guy there named Jerry once and thought he would willingly accept my first $10. He wasn't there, but I did see a man sitting by himself who looked really lonely, so I approached him. Now I had to figure out what I was going to say. I think I said something like, \"Hi, can I sit down here?\" \"I would like to know if I could give you $10?\" He asked me to repeat what I had said. I did, then he looked at me funny, got up and left. I then started walking south where I spotted a man standing by the bus stop on Connecticut Ave. He appeared to be in his 60s. I don't know what drew me to him, but I thought I would make my second attempt. I was a bit nervous and asked him which bus came by that stop. Then I explained that I was starting a year-long project to give $10 to someone every day and that I wanted to give my $10 for today to him.

The researchers tested the relationship between the number of childhood moves and well-being in a sample of 7108 American adults who were followed for 10 years. \"We know that children who move frequently are more likely to perform poorly in school and have more behavioral problems,\" said the study's lead author Shigehiro Oishi. \"However, the long-term effects of moving on well-being in adulthood have been overlooked by researchers.\" The study's participants, who were between the ages of 20 and 75, were contacted in 1994 and 1995 and were surveyed again 10 years later. They were asked how many times they had moved as children, as well as about their psychological well-being, personality type and social relationships. The researchers found that the more times people moved as children, the more likely they were to report lower life satisfaction and psychological well-being at the time they were surveyed. The research also showed that those who moved frequently as children had fewer quality social relationships as adults. The researchers also looked to see if different personality types affected frequent movers' well-being. Among introverts, the more moves participants reported as children, the worse off they were as adults. \"Moving a lot makes it difficult for people to keep long-term close relationships.\" Said Oishi. \"This might not be a serious problem for outgoing people who can make friends quickly and easily.\" The findings showed neurotic people who moved frequently reported less life satisfaction and poorer psychological well-being than people who did not move as much and people who were not neurotic. However, the number and quality of neurotic people's relationships had no effect on their well-being, no matter how often they had moved as children. In the article, Oishi thinks this may be because neurotic people have more negative reactions to stressful life events in general. \"We can guess that moving often creates more stress,\" Oishi said. \"But we need more research on this link before we can conclude that moving often in childhood can, in fact, be dangerous to your health in the long-term.\" What can be learnt about the new study from the passage?", "subject": ""}

In reality, none of us are failures. It's true that we will experience times of defeat, problems, and disasters, but remember, each one of us is meant to succeed in life. However, we must choose our fate. Henry David Thoreau said, \"Men are born to succeed, not to fail.\" We can never be forced into having a happy and successful life. Whether or not you experience success or failure is completely controlled by what you think and do. You are the only one who can choose the thoughts that will keep you from achieving the abundant life and joy that you are meant to have. No matter how difficult things may seem, say to yourself, \"I choose to be a happy and successful person.\" Why do some people get what they want and others fail? I believe that getting what you desire in life takes planning, and it doesn't just happen by luck. So how do we plan for success? It has been proven that successful people do things more differently than unsuccessful people. They recognize the patterns of success and follow them; one of those patterns is planning. They plan what they think and do, which sets them apart. They know exactly what they desire, have an intelligent plan for getting it, and then work their plan. They know what success will cost them in terms of time, energy, and results, and they devote the right resources toward making their plans happen.

Rich was not only not Chinese and he was a few years younger than I was.And unfortunately,he looked much younger with his curly red hair,smooth pale skin,and the splash of orange freckles  across his nose.He was a bit on the short side,compactly built.In his dark business suits,he looked nice but easily forgettable,which was why I didn't notice him the first year we worked together at the firm.But my mother noticed everything. \"So what do you think of Rich?\"I finally asked,holding my breath. She tossed the eggplant in the hot oil,angry hissing sound.\"So many spots on his face,\"she said. \"They are freckles.Freckles are good luck.\"I said a bit too heatedly in trying to raise my voice above the noise of the kitchen. \"Oh?\"She said innocently. \"Yes,the more spots the better.\" She considered this a moment and then smiled and spoke in Chinese:\"When you were young,you got the chicken pox.So many spots,you had to stay home for ten days.So lucky,you thought.\" I couldn't save Rich in the kitchen.And I couldn't save him later at the dinner table. When I offered Rich a fork,he insisted on using the slippery ivory chopsticks.Halfway between his plate and his open mouth,a large chunk of redcooked eggplant fell on his brand new white shirt. And then he helped himself to big portions of the shrimp and snow peas,not realizing he should have taken only a polite spoonful. He declined the new greens,the tender and expensive leaves of bean plants.He thought he was being polite by refusing seconds,when he should have followed my father's example,who made a big show of taking small portions of seconds,thirds and even fourths,always saying he couldn't resist another bite and then groaning he was so full he thought he would burst. But the worst was when Rich criticized my mother's cooking and he didn't even know what he had done.As is the Chinese cook's custom,my mother always made modest remarks about her own cooking.That night she chose to direct it toward her famous steamed pork and preserved vegetable dish,which she always served with special pride. \"Ai!This dish not salty enough,no flavor,\"she complained,after tasting a small bite. This was our family's cue to eat more and proclaim it the best she had ever made.But before we could do so,Rich said,\"You know,all it needs is a little soy sauce.\"And he proceeded to pour a riverful of the salty black stuff on the china plate,right before my mother's horrified eyes. And even though I was hoping throughout the dinner that my mother would somehow see Rich's kindness,his sense of humor and boyish charm.I knew he had failed miserably in her eyes. Rich obviously had a different opinion on how the evening had gone.When we got home,I was still shuddering, _ remembering how Rich had firmly shaken both my parents'hands with that same easy familiarity he used with nervous new clients.\"Linda,Tim,\"he said,\"we'll see you again.\"My parents'names are Lindo and Tin Jong,and nobody except a few older family friends ever calls them by their first names. \"What did she say when you told her?\"I knew he was referring to our getting married. \"I never had a chance,\"I said,which was true.How could I have told my mother I was getting married,when at every possible moment we were alone,she seemed to remark on how pale and ill he looked. Rich was smiling.\"How long does it take to say,Mom,Dad,I am getting married?\" \"You don't understand.You don't understand my mother.\" The author wrote this story in a/an    tone.", "subject": ""}
{"answer": 3, "choices": ["Regretful", "Annoyed", "Calm", "Happy"], "question": "Your morning cup of coffee may start to taste even better after a major government study found that frequent coffee drinkers have a lower risk of dying from a variety of diseases, compared with people who drink little or no coffee. The report, published online in The New England Journal of Medicine on Wednesday, analyzed the coffee-drinking habits of more thatn 400,000 men and women from 50 to 71 years old, making it the largest-ever study of the relationship between coffee consumption   and health. Previous   studies have offered conflicting results on the   benefits, or harm associated with regular coffee consumption. While coffee contains caffeine, which may temporarily increase heart rate and blood pressure in some people, coffee also contains hundreds of unique compounds that may do good to health. Further confusing much of the research into coffee is the fact that many coffee drinkers are also smokers, and it has been difficult to untangle the   health effects of coffee and cigarettes. To learn more, researchers from the National Institutes of Health analyzed diet and health information collected from questionnaires filled out by 229,119 men and 173,141 women, who were members of the American Association of Retired Persons (AARP) between 1995 and 1996. They were followed until 2008, by which point 52,000 had died. As expected, the researchers found that the regular coffee drinkers in the group were also more likely to be smokers. They are more red meat and fewer fruits and vegetables, exercised less and drank more alcohol -- all behaviors associated with poor health. But once the researchers were able to separate the risks, the data showed that the more coffee a person consumed, the less likely he or she was to die from a number of health problems, including diabetes, heart disease, respiratory disease, infections and even injuries and accidents.

There have been questions about Rio's bid because of the high level of violence which so often scars the city's image, but in one glorious moment that was all set to one side for a truly Brazilian party. In his speech earlier, President Lula had promised, \"Rio will deliver an unforgettable Games.

{"answer": 1, "choices": ["the size of the lake", "the direction of the wind", "the temperature of the lake", "the strength of the wind"], "question": "The south and east of the Great Lakes is famous for the huge amounts of snow it receives. When the snow starts to fall every year, people start discussing the phrase \"lake-effect snow\". Lake-effect snow which is influenced by the movement of cold air over the relatively warm water of the Great Lakes often comes in late autumn and early winter. Because of the at least 20 degrees' difference between the lake water and the overrunning air, it's easy to form huge amounts of snow. As the cool air crosses the water of Great Lakes, the lowest levels of the atmosphere begin to warm and pick up moisture. This newly warmed atmosphere is lighter than the cold air above it, so it starts rising. As the changed air continues to climb higher and higher, it finally meets much colder atmosphere which changes the moisture into water drops and ice, forming clouds. After this course repeats a number of times, the clouds become heavier and heavier, and then they are changed into snow and fall down. The most important point that decides the amount of snowfall is the direction of the wind. If the wind runs perpendicularly across the lake, there won't be plenty of time for clouds to develop. However, if the wind runs in the opposite direction, clouds will form easily. The longer the cold air travels over the lake, the more moisture it is able to produce, which leads to a greater amount of snow. The largest amount of the lake-effect snow was found across the U.P. of Michigan, the northwestern Pennsylvania and the far southwestern and northwestern New York, which are all along the south or east of the Great Lakes.

But this might change when the relationship gets serious and it is related to the money borrowed from the bank, the family present accounts and debt. A survey among 8 million couples in the UK suggested that 44% of married couples don't know exactly what their partner earns. An astonishing 23% actively try to keep their finances  secret from their partners. About 38% of them are open to each other. Another 12% refuses to tell the truth. British relationship expert Russell says: \"It's very difficult to talk about money. Often there's guilt, there's shame. To start those conversations is difficult. Money can be about how we value ourselves, how we feel valued. It's not just a simple case of talking about hard cash.\" So if you are in a couple, it might be a good idea to check if you both are on the same page about money before bills pile up on the kitchen table and love flies out of the window. When moving in together, couples should not only talk about their personal habits but also about their financial ones. Russell has a word of advice: \"Accept the fact that in your relationship you might do money differently - there might be a spender or a saver. It's very attractive if your partner does things differently to say they're wrong. Do it differently but plan it well.\" And now, back to that date. Would you be bored with someone who was attractive but expected you to pay the bill by yourself? There's food for thought.

However, as with other inventions such as the television and the computer, they are a double-edged sword, inviting both supporters and opponents, especially in regard to their use in public places like restaurants and cinemas. One of the strongest arguments in favor of forbidding mobiles in public places is the trouble they cause to other people. For example, although we are often asked to turn off our phones when in a cinema, the film that we are watching is often interrupted by the sound of at least five rings. To make it even worse, some people insist on continuing their conversation, even though hundreds of people can hear what they say, which often drowns out the voice from the film. As a result, many people would welcome a ban on mobile phones in places where they might disturb other people. On the other hand, there are a number of arguments against such a ban. It is difficult to stop people bringing with them their mobile phones in public places, making it almost impossible to call for a ban. Some people would see this as an infringement of their rights, while other people would say they need them in case of an emergency. Despite being asked to silence their phones, some people insist on leaving them on.  It seems to me that a ban on mobile phones would not have any result in the end. People will find a way to escape a ban. Nevertheless, people should be discouraged from using them in public places, unless it is highly necessary.

On the first day the professor marched up to the blackboard, looked through his notes, cleared his throat, and began. Fowkes was the only student in the course. Once Fowkes fell ill and missed a class. When he returned, to Fowkes' s astonishment, the professor began to deliver not the next lecture in the sequence but the one after. Had he lectured to an empty hall in the absence of his only student? It was perfectly possible. Today, professors continue to lecture and students to listen much as they did. It' s time for us to abandon the lecture system and turn to methods that really work. Attending lectures is passive learning ,at least for inexperienced listeners. Active learning, in which students write essays or perform experiments and then have their work evaluated by an instructor, is far more beneficial for those who have not yet fully learned how to learn. Most students learn best by engaging in debate. They need small discussion classes that demand a joint effort of teacher and students rather than classes in which one person, however learned, expresses his or her own ideas. The lecture system harms professors as well. It reduces feedback to a minimum, so that the lecturer can neither judge how well students understand the material nor benefit from their questions or comments. Questions that require the speaker to clarify unclear points and comments that challenge inadequately constructed arguments are indispensable to scholarship. Without them, the liveliest mind becomes dull. If lectures make so little sense, why have they been allowed to continue? The truth is that lectures are easier on everyone than debates. Lectures give some students an opportunity to sit back and let the professor run the show. In a classroom where everyone contributes, students are less able to hide and professors have less room to show off how smart they are. Worse still, the lectures too frequently come at the wrong end of the students' educational careers -- during the first two years, when they most need close, even individual, instruction.

It was convenient as we did most of our sightseeing on foot. Taxis were too expensive, we couldn't understand the bus routes, and my wife didn't like traveling under the ground. She said it made her feel sick. We went to look at the places which all tourists visit. We saw Buckingham Palace. We went shopping in Oxford Street and spent too much money. What we liked most, though, was going to the theatre. We didn't have the chance to see such wonderful plays at home. A lot of people say English food is bad. We didn't think so. It is true that most of the restaurants are French or Italian or Chinese, but we had some very good meals. In fact, we enjoyed our holiday so much that we have already booked again for this year. We are going to take our umbrellas, though. I'm sure we'll need them sometimes. Which of the following is NOT true about the couple?", "subject": ""}
{"answer": 0, "choices": ["Communication styles", "Features of Western culture", "Communication skills", "Politeness in communication"], "question": "The way Westerners communicate tends to  be  ly explicit   and direct. In other words, Westerners tend to put most of their ideas and feelings into words, and then state these ideas and feelings clearly and openly. It is generally considered a good thing to \"get to the point \"and \"say what you mean,\" and it is largely the speaker's responsibility to ensure that his/her message is stated in a way that is clear and easy to understand. In contrast , Chinese people tend to communicate in a way that is more indirect and subtle. They often view direct, explicit communication as unsophisticated or even rude. They are more likely to preserve good feelings and relationships by not saying something that might upset or offend  another person. If a Westerner makes a request and a Chinese person responds by saying something like \"I'll think it over\", the Westerner may assume that there is a good chance that the answer will be \"yes\". In fact, there is a better chance that the implied answer is \"no\". One interesting example of the Western preference for very direct communication can be seen in what Western students are taught about how they should organize their writing. Writers are generally expected to state their point as clearly as possible, generally right at the beginning. Students are taught to begin paragraphs with a \"topic sentence\" that states the point of the paragraph. Also, articles should generally begin with a brief statement of the points to be made -and also conclude with a review of those same points. In contrast, in Chinese writing it is more acceptable to build up to the point rather announcing it right form the start, although it is also acceptable to state the point up front. It is important to note that Westerners are not all equally direct in their communication styles. For example, the direct communication style is more typical of Western men than of Western women.

Why are some things funny to some people and not to others? How is that while a successful joke can cause pleasure,a sick one can cause serious harm? Over the centuries,various scholars have attempted to produce a universally agreed-upon theory of humor.Plato and Aristotle introduced the superiority  theory,the idea that people laugh at the misfortune of others.Their theory seems to explain teasing,but it doesn't work well for knock-knock jokes.Sigmund Freud argued for his relief theory,the concept that humor is a way for people to release psychological tension and reveal their inner fears and desires.His theory works well for dirty jokes,less well for most puns. The majority of humor expels today agree with the incongruity theory,the idea that humor arises when there's a gap between what people expect to happen and what actually happens.Incongruity has a lot going for it -- jokes with unexpected funny lines,for example,fit well.But scientists have found that in comedy,unexpectedness is overvalued. With the goal of developing a new,more satisfactory explanation,I produced \"the gentle violation theory\",the idea that humor arises when something seems wrong or threatening,but is actually OK or safe.A dirty joke,for example,trades on moral or social violations,but it's only going to get a laugh if the person listening is open enough to consider the subject OK to talk about.Similarly,puns can be seen as linguistic violations that still make grammatical sense.

{"answer": 2, "choices": ["20 %", "15%", "71%", "37%"], "question": "A recent Living Social survey showed that Americans may live up to their poor reputation while travelling abroad. But what's more surprising is that many of those surveyed self-identified themselves as 'ugly' Americans and the world's worst travelers. Those in the U.S. ranked themselves as the worst travellers by a shocking 20 per cent, followed by 15 per cent saying the Chinese were the most substandard tourists. Americans topped the list as being the worst-behaved travelers in a survey of 5,600 respondents, 4,000 of whom were Americans. Other respondents were in Australia, Canada, Ireland and the United Kingdom. But even American respondents considered their compatriots  as the worst travelers from a list of 16 nationalities. Canadians and Australians also put Americans in the No. 1 spot. Irish respondents pointed to U.K. residents and U.K. respondents gave Germans the nod. On the other hand, 37% of Americans opted for \"none of the above\" in answer to the worst-tourists question, displaying more tolerance and open-mindedness than the other nationalities. Other survey questions had respondents admitting _ from hotels. Four in ten U.S. survey-takers said they'd stolen something - mostly towels (28%) and bathrobes (8%). Other popular pinched items included pillows, remote controls, Bibles and sheets. Not surprising is that Americans have less time off from work than other nationalities.

It said 17,662 hardback copies were sold between 14 and 20 July, up from just 43 copies the previous week, according to Nielsen BookScan data. The Cuckoo's Calling was the week's bestselling hardback novel, despite some booksellers running out of stock. The Harry Potter author was identified in a newspaper article last week. On a website Rowling said 8,500 English language copies had been sold in all forms, including e-books, before her unmasking. The author added that she had received two offers from television production companies. \"The situation was becoming increasingly complicated, largely because Robert was doing rather better than we had expected him to,\" she said. \"But we all still hoped to keep the secret a little longer.  Robert's success during his first three months as a published writer (discounting sales made after I was found out) actually compares favourably with JK Rowling's success over the similar period of her career.\" However, the Bookseller reported the hardback had sold fewer than 500 copies in its three-month period on sale before the Sunday Times' expose. The recent sales were not enough to send The Cuckoo's Calling to the top spot in the official UK top 50, instead landing it in third place.

My family and all of my close friends were back home in Florida, and I was all alone in a rather cold California. I was working too many hours and became very sick. I was working a double shift at the Southwest Airlines ticket counter, it was about 9:00 PM on Christmas Eve, and I was feeling really miserable inside. There were a few of us working and very few customers waiting to be helped. When it was time for me to call the next person to the counter, I looked out to see the sweetest-looking old man standing with a cane. He walked very slowly over to the counter and in the faintest voice told me that he had to go to New Orleans. I tried to explain to him that there were no more flights that night and that he would have to go in the morning. He looked so confused and very worried. I tried to find out more information by asking if he had a reservation or if he remembered when he was supposed to travel, but he seemed to become more confused with each question. He just kept saying, \"She said I have to go to New Orleans.\" After much time, I was able to at least find out that this old man had been dropped off at the curb on Christmas Eve by his sister-in-law and told to go to New Orleans, where he had family. She had given him some cash and told him just to go inside and buy a ticket. When I asked if he could come back tomorrow, he said that she was gone and that he had no place to stay. He then said he would wait at the airport until tomorrow. Naturally, I felt a little ashamed. Here I was feeling very sorry for myself about being alone on Christmas, when this angel named Clarence MacDonald was sent to me to remind me of what being alone really meant. It broke my heart. Immediately, I told him we would get it all straightened out, and our Customer Service agent helped to book him a seat for the earliest flight the next morning. We gave him the senior citizen's fare, which gave him some extra money for travelling. About this time he started to look very tired, and when I stepped around the counter to ask him if he was all right, I saw that his leg was wrapped in a bandage. He had been standing on it that whole time, holding a plastic bag full of clothes. I called for a wheelchair. When the wheelchair came, we all stepped around to help him in, and I noticed a small amount of blood on his bandage. I asked how he hurt his leg, and he said that he had just had bypass surgery and an artery was taken from his leg. Can you imagine? This man had had heart surgery, and then shortly afterward, was dropped off at the curb to buy a ticket with no reservation to fly to New Orleans, alone! I never really had a situation like this, and I wasn't sure what I could do. I went back to ask my supervisors if we could find a place for him to stay. They both said yes, and they obtained a hotel voucher for Mr. MacDonald for one night and a meal ticket for dinner and breakfast.

The other rats of the pairs could see their suffering  friends clearly. In most pairs, the free rats would become very worried about their friends. They kept trying to save their friends again and again throughout the month. Scientists put the rats' favorite chocolate in the cages, but the rats didn't eat it until they had saved their friends successfully. Scientists also found that female rats seemed to act more empathetic than male rats. \"The results are the first to show that rats take action in response to another's trouble,\" Decety said. \"Monkeys and chimpanzees have similar behavior. But unlike those animals, rats can be ready used in laboratory studies. They will help us to learn which parts of the brain lead to empathy and helping behavior and whether empathy is natural.\" What does the passage mainly tell us?", "subject": ""}

In a market system individual economic units are free to interact among each other in the marketplace. It is possible to buy commodities from other economic units or sell commodities to them. In a market, transactions may take place via barter or money exchange. In a barter economy, _ goods such as automobiles, shoes, and pizzas are traded against each other.

Hence, the introduction of money as a medium of exchange eases transactions considerably. In the modern market economy, goods and services are bought or sold for money. An alternative to the market system is administrative control by some agency over all transactions. This agency will issue commands as to how much of each good and service should be produced, exchanged, and consumed by each economic unit. Central planning may be one way of administering such an economy. The central plan, drawn up by the government, shows the amounts of each commodity produced by the various firms and allocated to different households for consumption.

Art therapy   uses the creation or viewing of art to help people discover and express their feelings.

Art therapists believe that the act of making a piece of art _ internal activity that contributes to physical, emotional and spiritual healing. For people who are not able or ready to create art, going to an art museum or looking through art books or virtual art galleries can also be helpful. Simply viewing art refreshes the spirit and promotes relaxation. Art therapy is helpful in healing in various ways. The aesthetic quality of the work produced can lift a person's mood, boost self-awareness, improve self-esteem and increase self-confidence. Also, research shows that physiological functions, such as heart rate, blood pressure, and respiration , become slow when people are deeply involved in an activity they enjoy. Because art therapy uses a language other than words, it is often employed in treating patients with physical or emotional illnesses who have difficulty talking about their fears or hopes, or about their anger and other strong emotions. The creation of art helps people get in touch with thoughts and feelings that are often hidden from the conscious mind. Stress reduction is also a significant benefit. Studies have shown that repressing strong feelings can lead to a buildup of stress, and that stress can intensify pain and the symptoms of various diseases.

Art therapy   uses the creation or viewing of art to help people discover and express their feelings. Unlike art for art's sake, which focuses on the finished piece, art therapy focuses on the process of creation itself. Art therapists believe that the act of making a piece of art _ internal activity that contributes to physical, emotional and spiritual healing. For people who are not able or ready to create art, going to an art museum or looking through art books or virtual art galleries can also be helpful. Simply viewing art refreshes the spirit and promotes relaxation. Art therapy is helpful in healing in various ways. The aesthetic quality of the work produced can lift a person's mood, boost self-awareness, improve self-esteem and increase self-confidence. Also, research shows that physiological functions, such as heart rate, blood pressure, and respiration , become slow when people are deeply involved in an activity they enjoy. Because art therapy uses a language other than words, it is often employed in treating patients with physical or emotional illnesses who have difficulty talking about their fears or hopes, or about their anger and other strong emotions. The creation of art helps people get in touch with thoughts and feelings that are often hidden from the conscious mind. Stress reduction is also a significant benefit. Studies have shown that repressing strong feelings can lead to a buildup of stress, and that stress can intensify pain and the symptoms of various diseases. Because art therapy helps people access their unconscious mind and release pent-up  emotions, it has been found to be very useful in treating those suffering from stress and stress-related illnesses. Why is art therapy useful to patients with physical or emotional illnesses?", "subject": ""}

The results of their study led to a theory opposite to a central one of aerodynamics  , which says that the power needed to fly increases with weight.     For birds, obviously, the cost of flying with heavy fat is much smaller than we used to think. Researchers found that red knot wading birds double their normal body weight of 100 grams before making their twice-a-year nonstop flight between the British Isles and the Russian Arctic. Distance: 5,000 kilometers.     Another study in the magazine Nature measured the advantage of flying in an aerodynamic group which allows birds to save energy by flying smoothly and quietly in the lead bird' s air stream.     Flying in groups, their heart rates were 14.5 percent lower than flying alone, according to Henri, a French scientist. The findings help explain how birds complete difficult migrations. Researchers had thought that thinner, stronger birds would have the best chance to survive.     The first study suggests that building up fat to be burnt as fuel during the migration is worth more than the energy it takes to carry the additional weight.     In the study, researchers said their team studied the birds flown at different body weights during 28 simulated  flights.

Five years in the making, the center was developed and funded by the Statue of the Liberty-Ellis Island Foundation, Inc., which was responsible for the restoration and preservation of the Statue of the Liberty and Ellis Island, and the creation of the Immigration   Museum.    For visitors to the Museum, the excitement begins at a welcoming kioskwhere you can enter ancestors' names and see if their arrival records are included in the database and are available in the History Center in the Museum's West Wing. Once inside the Center itself, in the very place where your ancestors (grand-grandparents) may have ended their long journey, you and your family can log on the one of 41 computers, type in name, and, within seconds, set in motion your own special journey of discovery.

{"answer": 0, "choices": ["Punishment has double functions.", "A thief may be referred to as an impolite person.", "Punishment is not regarded as a deterrent.", "There is lots of communal living and sharing of objects."], "question": "The idea of \"law\" exists in every culture. All societies have some kind of law to keep order and to control the interactions of people with those around them. The laws of any culture tell people three things: what they can do (their right), what they must do (their duties), and what they may not do. In addition, there are usually specific types of punishment for those who break the law. Although all societies have laws, not all have the same idea of justice--which is \"right\" and \"wrong\" and how \"wrong\" should be punished. In most Western cultures, it is thought that punishing criminals will prevent them from committing other crimes. Also, it is hoped that the fear of punishment will act as a deterrent  that prevents other people from committing similar crimes; in other words, people who are considering a life of crime will decide against it because of fear of punishment. In most non-Western cultures, by contrast, punishment is not seen as a deterrent. Instead, great importance is placed on restoring balance in the situation. A thief, for example, may be ordered to return the things he has stolen instead of, as in Western societies, spending time in prison. Another difference in the concept of justice lies in various societies' ideas of what laws are. In the West, people consider \"laws\" quite different from \"customs\". There is also a great contrast between \"sins\" (breaking religious laws) and \"crimes\" (breaking laws of the government). In many non-Western cultures, on the other hand, there is little separation of customs, laws, and religious beliefs; in other cultures, these three may be quite separate from one another, but still very much different from those in the West. For these reasons, an action may be considered a crime in one country, but be socially acceptable in others. For instance, although a thief is viewed as a criminal in much of the world, in a small village where there is considerable communal  living and sharing of objects, the word thief may have little meaning. Someone who has taken something without asking is simply considered an impolite person. Most countries have two kinds of law: criminal and civil. People who have been accused of acts such as murder or theft are heard in the criminal justice system, while civil justice deals with people who are believed to have violated others' rights. The use of the civil system reflects the values of the society in which it exists. In the United States where personal, individual justice is considered very important, civil law has become \"big business.\" There are over 600,000 lawyers in the United States, and many of them keep busy with civil lawsuits; that is, they work for people who want to sue others. If a man falls over a torn rug in a hotel and breaks his arm, for instance, he might decide to sue the hotel owners so that they will pay his medical costs. In a country like Japan, by contrast, there is very little use of the civil justice system. Lawsuits are not very popular in Japan, where social harmony is even more important than individual rights, and where people would rather reach agreement outside court.

But it wasn't long before Conor came to learn that the children were not orphans at all--they were actually children who had been separated from their parents by a child trafficker  . This realization turned Conor's global journey into a strong desire to try to find a way to reunite these children with their families.

Dogs bring much happiness to their owners, and even improve human health. Most two year olds keep us busy in life -- an important part of living a long and happy life. According to Stanley Coren, Ph.D.of the University of British Columbia, our dogs are smarter than we thought. Dr.Coren reviewed many studies to find out that dogs are as smart as 2 to 2.5 year olds. Forget about one word orders -- according to Coren, the smartest dogs can learn up to 250 words. Most dogs understand an average of 165 words. \"The upper limit of dogs\" ability to learn language is partly based on a study of a Border Collie   named Rico who showed knowledge of 200 spoken words, and 'fast-track learning', which scientists believed to be found only in humans and language-learning apes .  Dogs are also great at tricking. During play, they have the ability to trick humans and other dogs in order to get treats. \"And they are nearly as successful in tricking humans as humans are in tricking dogs, saysCoren. Dogs can also count to four or five, which might explain how they know when their toys are missing.

Most dogs understand an average of 165 words. \"The upper limit of dogs\" ability to learn language is partly based on a study of a Border Collie   named Rico who showed knowledge of 200 spoken words, and 'fast-track learning', which scientists believed to be found only in humans and language-learning apes .  Dogs are also great at tricking. During play, they have the ability to trick humans and other dogs in order to get treats. \"And they are nearly as successful in tricking humans as humans are in tricking dogs, saysCoren. Dogs can also count to four or five, which might explain how they know when their toys are missing. Coren explains,\"Their astonishing flashes of smartness and creativity are reminders that they may not be Ensteins, but are sure closer to humans than we thought.\" Animals can do much to keep us happy, health, and protect us from harm.

Even a small reduction in salt in the diet can be a big help to the heart. A new study used a computer model to predict -how just three grams less a day would affect heart disease in the United States. The result: Thirteen percent fewer heart attacks. Eight percent fewer strokes. Four percent fewer deaths. Eleven percent fewer new cases of heart disease. And two hundred forty billion dollars in health care savings. Researchers found it could prevent one hundred thousand heart attacks and ninety-two thousand deaths every year. The study is in the New England Journal of Medicine. Kirsten Bibbins-Domingo at the University of California San Francisco was the lead author. She says people would not even notice a difference in taste with three grams,or one-half teaspoon, less salt per day. The team also included researchers at Stanford and Columbia University.

McDonald's menus clearly showing how many calories were in each food. Parents given the counts chose an average of one hundred two fewer calories when asked what they would order for their children. Yet there was no difference in calories between the two groups for foods that the parents would have chosen for themselves. Study leader Pooja Tandon says even small calorie reductions on a regular basis can prevent weight gain over time.The study was published in the journal Pediatrics.

And the world is divided-- some countries are planning more nuclear plants, while others have promised to shut theirs down. After Fukushima, Germany decided to switch off all its nuclear plants by 2022. Switzerland and Italy are also phasing out nuclear power. But France and the United States remain staunch supporters of atomic energy. In fact, almost 80% of France's electricity comes from nuclear power, the highest percentage in the world. And in the US, the Obama administration said it \"continues to support the expansion of nuclear power, despite the crisis in Japan.\" Nuclear supporters claim nuclear power can help the environment. Unlike fossil fuels, nuclear power doesn't create greenhouse gases. So, pro-nuclear countries argue that nuclear power allows them to generate energy without contributing to climate change. Britain's chief scientific adviser (John Beddington) supports this view. He recently said that the world doesn't have the luxury of ignoring nuclear energy. Nuclear power is also relatively cheap. Renewable energy sources such as solar, hydro and wind power may be clean, but they're expensive; and right now, they require a lot of investment. This higher cost of using \"green energy\" is usually passed onto the consumer. So, while many people may prefer their energy to come from a renewable source, not so many are prepared to pay higher energy bills. _ is of particular concern while the world economy is in such bad shape. The main argument against nuclear energy is that it isn't safe. For a start, nuclear waste is very difficult to dispose of, and remains toxic to humans for thousands of years.

In today's prosperous societies, the distinction has become unclear because so many wants have been turned into needs.A writer, for instance, can work with paper and pencils. These are legal needs for the task.But the work can be done more quickly and efficiently with a word processor. Thus a computer is soon viewed as a need rather than a want. In the field of marketing, consumer goods are classed according to the way in which they are purchased.The two main classes are convenience goods and shopping goods.Two lesser types are specialty goods and unsought   goods. It must be emphasized that all of these types are based on the way shoppers think about products, not on the nature of the products themselves. What is regarded as a convenience item in France(wine,for example)should be a specialty goods in the United States. People do not spend a great deal of time shopping for such convenience items as groceries, newspapers, toothpaste, aspirin, and candy. The buying of convenience goods may be done routinely, as some families buy groceries once a week. Such regularly purchased items are called staples. Sometimes convenience products are bought without enough thinking; someone has a sudden desire for an ice cream sundae on a hot day. Or they may be purchased as emergency items. Shopping goods are items for which customers search. They compare prices. quality, and styles, and may visit a number of stores before making a decision.Buying an automobile is often done this way. Shopping goods fail into two classes:those that are recognized as basically the same and those that are regarded as different. Items that are looked upon as basically the same include such things as home appliances, television sets, and automobiles.Having decided on the model desired, the customer is primarily interested in getting the item at the most favorable price.

You know the standard explanations: keeping a moderate diet, engaging in regular exercise, etc. But what effect does your personality have on your longevity ? Do some kinds of personalities lead to longer lives? A new study in theJournal of the American Geriatrics Societylooked at this question by examining the personality characteristics of 246 children of people who had lived to be at least 100. The study shows that those living the longest are more outgoing, more active and less neurotic   than other people. Long-living women are also more likely to be sympathetic and cooperative than women with a normal life span. These findings are in agreement with what you would expect from the evolutionary theory: those who like to make friends and help others can gather enough resources to make it through tough times. Interestingly, however, other characteristics that you might consider advantageous had no impact on whether study participants were likely to live longer. Those who were more self-disciplined, for instance, were no more likely to live to be very old. Also, being open to new ideas had no relationship to long life, which might explain all those bad-tempered old people who are fixed in their ways. Whether you can successfully change your personality as an adult is the subject of a longstanding psychological debate. But the new paper suggests that if you want long life, you should strive to be as outgoing as possible. Unfortunately, another recent study shows that your mother's personality may also help determine your longevity. That study looked at nearly 28,000 Norwegian mothers and found that those moms who were more anxious, depressed and angry were more likely to feed their kids unhealthy diets.

{"answer": 0, "choices": ["To help overcome interview nerves", "To tell people the meaning of interview nerves", "To tell people how to attend interviews", "To help people become more confident"], "question": "A recent research shows that most people while attending their very first or second interview face the problem of interview nerves. This interview nerves simply make them nervous and depressed. This mainly happens due to lack of confidence and belief in oneself. Most of them even suffer from sleepless nights. They feel as if interviews are nothing but a questioning by an unknown person who will judge them by their answers. They simply can't understand or _ that the interviews are as beneficial for them as for the company. To overcome these problems, people need to make their mind set for facing the interview full of confidence. This can be done by building up confidence that this job is for me only. They need to make preparations for the estimated questions to be asked in the interview. They also need to be familiar with a few details of the company like its products, vision, recent achievement, etc. This is just to have an upper hand in the interview so that you can explain that you are the right candidate for the company. One must be completely relaxed before the interview. Because stress is one of the major reasons which reduces one's performance ability. Another way of getting over with your nerves is by a well known therapy called as hypnosis. Hypnosis is a very effective therapy which is generally used for curing nerves of Examinations, Interviews, Meetings, etc. Hypnosis mainly activates your subconscious mind so that you are extra alert and attentive what you are doing. Thus this gives you a lot more confidence to deal with.

The video, released online on Monday, showed host Bi Fujian using vulgar words about Chairman Mao Zedong while singing in the style of Peking Opera, enraging  some netizens and causing a stir on the Internet. CCTV said on its micro blog on Wednesday that it will investigate the incident, which it said many have found disturbing. Bi's programs will stop being broadcast until at least Sunday, as his comments in the video have seriously damaged the broadcaster's image, Huaxi Metropolis Daily quoted a CCTV staff member as saying.

I recently sat down to a relaxed and enjoyable dinner with some friends. At the beginning of the meal, a friend told us that his car had just been broken into and his briefcase   had been stolen. He was frustrated   because his diary and a number of other items important to him were in the briefcase. He said he could remember only four items that were in his stolen briefcase, that he knew there were many more, that he had to give a full report to the police within two hours, and that the more he tried to remember the more blocked he became. Several of us at the table who were familiar with Memory Principles   then took him through the following exercise; instead of continuing to allow him to think of what he could not remember, we asked him when he had last had his briefcase open. It turned out that it was at the office just before he left work, at which point he suddenly remembered that he had put two important magazine articles in the briefcase. We then asked him when he had last had the briefcase open before leaving home for work. It turned out to have been the night before, and he remembered having put in two more articles as well as a tape recorder, in preparation for the following morning. Finally we asked him to describe the inner   design of his briefcase, and as he went through a detailed description, he remembered pens, pencils, letters and a number of other items that he had completely \"forgotten\" before. Within 20 minutes, he remembered 18 additional items. The secret is to \"forget about\" whatever you are trying to remember and \" _ \" all experiences that connect in any way with the item you are trying to remember. This method works at once almost in all cases, and takes the form of a created Mind Map around the \"missing\" center. This memory method, like the others, improves your memory as well as your creativity, and in addition gives you confidence when you realize that, no matter what you have forgotten, there is still a chance to solve any memory mystery  !

Harvard Divinity School Professor Karen King recently explained the Coptic wording on the papyrus. She says the words mean that Jesus called Mary Magdalene, an early Christian, \"my wife.\" She says he did this while speaking to his disciples, or followers. \"I don't think that this text is that significant. There are so many barriers for it to get over. You've got to show that it's reliable, and there are real questions about whether that text is reliable.\" Professor Bock expresses other concerns about the papyrus. For example, he says, there is not enough writing on it to establish the real meaning of the words. He says the word \"wife\" may not mean \"wife\" in the traditional way. And, he says the papyrus is just one text showing that Jesus might have been married. \"And then you've got the fact that this is one text out of many, many, many texts that don't indicate that Jesus was married. And I think had Jesus been married, the early tradition about Jesus would have reflected that.\" What's the writer's opinion about the debate going on in the passage?", "subject": ""}
