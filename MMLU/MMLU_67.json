So you may find it surprising to learn that prior to the late 1800s each community established its own time - by looking at the sun. When the sun shone directly overhead in Washington, D.C., for example, it was 12:00 noon there; up the road in Philadelphia, however, it was 12:07, and in Boston it was 12:24. To measure time with   accuracy, it is necessary to move the clock about one minute for every twelve miles of distance; so according to \"sun time\" your pocket watch would be slightly incorrect if you ventured only a few miles down the road. It was not until the advent of widespread railroad travel that a need arose for regularized time. At one point over 300 local times were honored within the country, making it literally impossible for trains to arrive consistently on time everywhere. As a result, in 1883 the continental, United States was divided into four time longitude. The standardization resulting from this system proved so helpful that in 1884 the International Meridian Conference applied the same procedure to establish time zones around the world.

Although dinner might be just about our only daily opportunity to sit down together, catch up and eat a healthy meal, we tend to be too busy/stressed/tired (you can throw in a dozen other reasons) to cook ourselves. The kids are shrieking, everyone is starving and your fridge contains nothing but a few squishy squashes and a limp carrot. So what do we all do? We give up and give in to some awful food choices that someone in some far-off factory or fast-food restaurant \"cooked\" without one bit of love in their heart. And this is making us sick and fat and it's killing us. Why not try HOME COOKED SUNDAYS? The idea is simple: Use the one day of the week we do have time to cook -- Sundays. Let's make it a fun bonding activity -- and a wildly productive and delicious one, too. Let's use Sundays to shop, prep and cook with our families (hey, everyone can pitch in!), and then enjoy a great sit-down dinner at the family table. Let's turn this into a cherished weekly ritual . To get people excited and cooking again, Kirstin Uhrenholdt (she is Danish and -- no kidding -- grew up on a fruit farm) and I wrote The Family Cooks, a cookbook filled with easy, healthy and tasty recipes. We included lots of tips and tricks to avoid an unhealthy week -- including how to avoid junk food hazards in the supermarket, and ways that small and big kids can help you cook. We know you have good ones, too. So let's share all our great ideas and inspire others to give it a try, because we know that Home Cooked Sundays will guarantee calmer and healthier weeknights -- and give us the perfect way to start the week connecting with our kids while teaching them a thing or two about health and happiness. Will you help make home-cooked meals synonymous with Sundays? Share your ideas, inspirations and best tips on how you prep your fridge on Sunday for a smooth week ahead. Send us your three best tips and favorite go-to recipe for Sunday dinner. We will post ours, and together, we'll make Home Cooked Sunday the single best and most delicious day of the week!

That's probably what Kazakh villagers in the Almaty region though when they decided to replace their dogs with the fierce forest dwelling beasts. According to local news reports, taming  wolves is now the latest trend and a sort of hobby among rural Kazakhs. Nurseit Zhylkyshybay, a farmer from the south-eastern Almaty region, told reporters that he purchased a wolf cub from hunters three years ago, and the animal is now perfectly tamed. Kurtka, Nurseit's pet wolf, lives in the family's yard and takes long walks through the village with his master. \"He's never _ ,\" Nurseit insisted. \"I rarely put him on a chain and do take him for regular walks around the village. Our family and neighbors aren't scared of him at all.\" But wolf expert Almas Zhaparov said that the animals are 'far too dangerous' to keep at home. \"A wolf is like a ticking bomb, it can go off at any moment,\" he warned. \"If nothing is done, the fashion could spread to the wealthy Kazakhs, who might try to keep wolves in the grounds of their houses, with possibly deadly consequences.\" Social media users also expressed worry about the trend, accusing the government for failing to limit the practice. Nevertheless, the wolves don't seem to be posing an immediate threat.

Green energy, for example. Then, energy independence. It has a nice ring to it. Doesn't it? If you think so, you're not alone, because energy independence has been the dream of American president for decades, and never more so than in the past few years, when the most recent oil price shock has been partly responsible for kicking off the great recession . \"Energy independence\" and its rhetorical  companion \"energy security\" are, however, unreliable concepts that are rarely thought through. What is it that we want independence from, exactly? Most people would probably say that they want to be independent from imported oil. But there are reasons that we buy all that oil from elsewhere. The first reason is that we need it to keep our economy running. Yes, there is a trickle  of biofuel  available, and more may become available, but most biofuels cause economic waste and environmental destruction. Second, Americans have basically decided that they don't really want to produce all their own oil. They value the environmental quality they preserve over their oil imports from abroad. Vast areas of the United States are off-limits to oil exploration and production in the name of environmental protection. To what extent are Americans really willing to tolerate the environmental influence of domestic  energy production in order to cut back imports? Third, there are benefits to trade. It allows for economic efficiency, and when we buy things from places that have lower production costs than we do, we benefit. And although you don't read about this much, the United States is also a large exporter of oil products, selling about 2 million barrels of petroleum products per day to about 90 countries. There is no question that the United States imports a great deal of energy and, in fact, relies on that steady flow to keep its economy stable. When that flow is interrupted, we feel the pain in short supplies and higher prices.

The most you can say about anyone's preference is that it's one person's opinion. But because the two big cola companies--Coca-Cola and Pepsi Cola are marketed so aggressively, we've wondered how big a role taste preference actually plays in brand loyalty. We set up a taste test that challenged people who identified themselves as either Coca-Cola or Pepsi fans: Find your brand in a blind tasting. We invited staff volunteers who had a strong liking for either Coca-Cola Classic   or Pepsi, Diet   Coke, or Diet Pepsi. These were people who thought they'd have no trouble telling their brand from the other brand. We eventually located 19 regular cola drinkers and 27 diet cola drinkers. Then we fed them four unidentified samples of cola one at a time, regular colas for the one group, diet versions for the other. We asked them to tell us whether each sample was Coke or Pepsi; then we analyzed the records statistically to compare the participants' choices with what mere guess-work could have accomplished. Getting all four samples right was a tough test, but not too tough, we thought, for people who believed they could recognize their brand. In the end, only 7 out of 19 regular cola drinkers correctly identified their brand of choice in all four trials.

The most you can say about anyone's preference is that it's one person's opinion. But because the two big cola companies--Coca-Cola and Pepsi Cola are marketed so aggressively, we've wondered how big a role taste preference actually plays in brand loyalty. We set up a taste test that challenged people who identified themselves as either Coca-Cola or Pepsi fans: Find your brand in a blind tasting. We invited staff volunteers who had a strong liking for either Coca-Cola Classic   or Pepsi, Diet   Coke, or Diet Pepsi. These were people who thought they'd have no trouble telling their brand from the other brand. We eventually located 19 regular cola drinkers and 27 diet cola drinkers. Then we fed them four unidentified samples of cola one at a time, regular colas for the one group, diet versions for the other. We asked them to tell us whether each sample was Coke or Pepsi; then we analyzed the records statistically to compare the participants' choices with what mere guess-work could have accomplished. Getting all four samples right was a tough test, but not too tough, we thought, for people who believed they could recognize their brand. In the end, only 7 out of 19 regular cola drinkers correctly identified their brand of choice in all four trials. The diet-cola drinkers did a little worse----only 7 of 27 identified all four samples correctly.

In 273 B.C., the Qin army launched a more serious attack upon the State of Wei than ever. The king of the State of Wei gathered his officials, and asked with a worried look if anyone could propose a way to defeat the Qin army. After years of chaos caused by the wars, the officials trembled when fighting was mentioned, and no one dared to speak of resistance. At the critical moment when a large enemy force was bearing down upon the border, most of the officials persuaded the king to peace, at the cost of giving away to the State of Qin the large area of land north of the Huanghe River and south of the Taihang Mountain. However Su Dai, a counselor, did not agree. He hurried up to the king and said, \"Your Majesty, they don't think about the interests of the country at all. It is just because they are afraid of death that they ask you to sue for peace by betraying the country. Of course you can temporarily satisfy the ambition of Qin, but it will never stop attacking us until our land is totally given away.\" He added,\"Once there was a man whose house was on fire. People told him to put out the fire with water, but he would not listen. Instead, he carried a faggot to put out the fire, only to make the fire fiercer. Isn't it similar to carrying faggots to put out a fire if you agree to sue for peace at the cost of the land of the State of Wei?\" Though Su Dai's argument was very convincing, the king accepted the suggestion of those officials and gave away to the State of Qin a large area of the land of the State of Wei. As might be expected, the Qin army attacked the State of Wei in 225 B.C. again, surrounding the capital city Daliang and flooding it by digging open the dykes   of the Huanghe River.

After years of chaos caused by the wars, the officials trembled when fighting was mentioned, and no one dared to speak of resistance. At the critical moment when a large enemy force was bearing down upon the border, most of the officials persuaded the king to peace, at the cost of giving away to the State of Qin the large area of land north of the Huanghe River and south of the Taihang Mountain. However Su Dai, a counselor, did not agree. He hurried up to the king and said, \"Your Majesty, they don't think about the interests of the country at all. It is just because they are afraid of death that they ask you to sue for peace by betraying the country. Of course you can temporarily satisfy the ambition of Qin, but it will never stop attacking us until our land is totally given away.\" He added,\"Once there was a man whose house was on fire. People told him to put out the fire with water, but he would not listen. Instead, he carried a faggot to put out the fire, only to make the fire fiercer. Isn't it similar to carrying faggots to put out a fire if you agree to sue for peace at the cost of the land of the State of Wei?\" Though Su Dai's argument was very convincing, the king accepted the suggestion of those officials and gave away to the State of Qin a large area of the land of the State of Wei. As might be expected, the Qin army attacked the State of Wei in 225 B.C. again, surrounding the capital city Daliang and flooding it by digging open the dykes   of the Huanghe River.

Seven years later, just after her first show, Anna married Sir Henry Bishop, who was 24 years her senior. Her reputation as a singer grew rapidly, based largely on her tours with Sir Henry and harpist Nicholas Bochsa.

Between 1839 and 1843 she traveled to every major town in Europe, where she sang in 260 concerts. In the course of two years in Naples, she performed in 20 operas. In 1855 she and Bochsa sailed for Sydney, Australia. He died there the following year, and Anna went on to tour South America before returning to New York, where she married a diamond merchant.

Although Sushi is most commonly considered to have its origin in Japan, it actually began in China during the 7thCentury. At that time, any fish caught had to be preserved. Raw fish was cleaned and then pressed between layers of heavy salt. After a couple of months, the whole process was complete. Over time, a discovery was made that by rolling the fish in rice that had been soaked in vinegar the fish was easily fermented   in a few days rather than months. The rice was then thrown away and the fish was eaten. However, with a food shortage, people began consuming the rice as well as the fish and thus, Sushi today as we know was born. However, in the 1800s, a famous chef by the name of Yohei created two styles of Sushi--one called Edo, and the second, Osaka, for two cities. Sushi is usually consumed with hot green tea. Also, Gari is offered free and eaten between bites to create a better taste. Two kinds of sauce are usually available: one is soy sauce, which is poured on most kinds of Sushi; the other is a thick sweet sauce used on eel  .

{"answer": 3, "choices": ["Because it means convenience to people.", "Because it can help people save a lot of money.", "Because local food has more nutrition.", "Because it is environmentally friendly."], "question": "\"Eat local.\" It's one way to reduce human effect on the planet.Eating local means to try to buy and consume foods that are grown in places close to home.However, most of the food sold at supermarkets is not locally grown or produced.Trucks and planes deliver these foods from hundreds or thousands of miles away.During the transportation, greenhouse gases are produced, causing global warming.So the shorter the distance your foods must travel, the less the harm is done to the environment. But how do you get local food if you live in a large city, hundreds of miles away from farms?Environmental health scientist Dickson Despommier and his students came up with the idea of a \"vertical farm\". A vertical farm is a glass-walled structure that could be built as tall as a skyscraper.Since the garden is built upwards, rather than outwards, it requires much less space than an ordinary farm.The world is quickly running out of room for ordinary farming.Vertical farms could be a key to this situation.Despommier imagines a 30-story building with a greenhouse on every floor.The walls of the building would be clear, to allow crops to get as much sunlight as possible.Depending on a city's water resources, Despommier thinks hydroponic  farming is another method for the vertical farm which needs no soil to grow plants. Despommier says the hydroponic greenhouses would use a system that would use a city's waste water and fill it with nutrition to make the crops grow.If this method works, it would provide food to a city and save millions of tons of water.

Except that when I popped out they decided at the last minute that they really wanted a girl. So my parents, who were on a waiting list, got a call in the middle of the night asking: \"We have an unexpected baby boy; do you want him?\" They said: \"Of course. \" My biological mother later found out that my mother had never graduated from college and that my father had never graduated from high school. She refused to sign the final adoption papers, She only gave in a few months later when my parents promised that would someday go to college. And 17 years later I did go to college.

Another popular type, the quill mum, has long, straight petals like a tube or needle. Chrysanthemum blooms can be white, yellow, gold, red or other colors. The plants often grow one meter high. The soil for chrysanthemums should be kept moist but well drained so it does not get too wet. Newly-planted mums should be watered two or three times a week, depending on conditions. Plants established in the ground may do well just with normal rainfall. Mums grow best in full sunshine. They produce colorful blooms when days get shorter and nights get longer.

The light may interfere with their normal growth cycle. The plants may develop buds too soon. In climates where temperatures fall below freezing, plant mums at least six weeks before the first frost. That way, the plants will be well established for cold weather. Some gardeners say the most beautiful presentation comes from planting mums close together.

Cai Chunzhu, a celebrity playwright, recalled feeling heartbroken when his son was diagnosed with autism at the age of 2. He says his family struggled to accept the reality but finally made peace with the diagnoses in the past four years. He says the boy lives in his own world and is trained in an intervention facility. Sun Zhongkai, executive director of the Beijing Stars and Rain Institute for Autism, one of the earliest intervention facilities for autistic children in China, shared with audience his deep sorrow for parents who often collapsed with desperation when he told them there was no cure for their autistic children. Over the years, Chinese society has become more supportive of autistic people and their families, but there are still challenges in terms of getting autistic people employed and looking after them when their parents pass away. Actor Zhou Xun also called on society to show greater understanding and support toward autistic children and their families. What is the attitude of our society and enthusiastic people?", "subject": ""}

In less than four decades, Mr. Last claims we will live longer, have children in old age and rely on artificial intelligence to do ordinary and boring tasks. This shift is so significant, he claims, it is comparable to the change from monkeys to apes, and apes to humans. \"Your 80 or 100 is going to be so radically different than your grandparents,\" Mr. Last says, who believes we will spend much of our time living in virtual reality.

And if you've gathered your friends around you to rebuild a happy family atmosphere , you may fear that saying no will bring back the kind of conflict you grew up with--or destroy the nice atmosphere you now enjoy.

They bring boyfriends over, talk on the phone and stay out forever. I enjoy having my friends here sometimes--it makes the place feel comfortable and warm--but this is my home, not a party house.

Remarkably, he could read, yet, in spite of his reading skills, Steve was failing. He had been failing since first grade, as he was passed on from grade to grade. Steve was a big boy, looking more like a teenager than a twelve year old, yet, Steve went unnoticed... until Miss White. Miss White was a smiling, young, beautiful redhead, and Steve was in love! For the first time in his young life, he couldn't take his eyes off his teacher; yet, still he failed. He never did his homework, and he was always in trouble with Miss White. His heart would break under her sharp words, and when he was punished for failing to turn in his homework, he felt just miserable! Still, he did not study. In the middle of the first semester of school, the entire seventh grade was tested for basic skills. Steve hurried through his tests, and continued to dream of other things, as the day wore on. His heart was not in school, but in the woods, where he often escaped alone, trying to shut out the sights, sounds and smells of his alcoholic home. No one checked on him to see if he was safe. No one knew he was gone, because no one was sober  enough to care. Oddly, Steve never missed a day of school. One day, Miss White's impatient voice broke into his daydreams. \"Steve!!\" Startled, he turned to look at her. \"Pay attention!\" Steve locked his gaze on Miss White with adolescent adoration  , as she began to go over the test results for the seventh grade. \"You all did pretty well,\" she told the class, \"except for one boy, and it breaks my heart to tell you this, but...\" She hesitated, pinning Steve to his seat with a sharp stare, her eyes searching his face. \"...The smartest boy in the seventh grade is failing my class!\" She just stared at Steve, as the class spun around for a good look. Steve dropped his eyes and carefully examined his fingertips. After that, it was war!! Steve still wouldn't do his homework. Even as the punishments became more severe, he remained stubborn. \"Just try it! ONE WEEK!\" He was unmoved. \"You're smart enough! You'll see a change!\" Nothing fazed him. \"Give yourself a chance! Don't give up on your life!\" Nothing. \"Steve! Please! I care about you!\" Wow! Suddenly, Steve got it!! Someone cared about him? Someone, totally unattainable and perfect, CARED ABOUT HIM??!! Steve went home from school, thoughtful, that afternoon. Walking into the house, he took one look around. Both parents were passed out, in various stages of undress, and the stench  was overpowering! He, quickly, gathered up his camping gear, a jar of peanut butter, a loaf of bread, a bottle of water, and this time...his schoolbooks. Grim faced and determined, he headed for the woods. The following Monday he arrived at school on time, and he waited for Miss White to enter the classroom. She walked in, all sparkle and smiles! God, she was beautiful! He yearned for her smile to turn on him. It did not. Miss White, immediately, gave a quiz on the weekend homework. Steve hurried through the test, and was the first to hand in his paper. With a look of surprise, Miss White took his paper. Obviously puzzled, she began to look it over. Steve walked back to his desk, his heart pounding within his chest. As he sat down, he couldn't resist another look at the lovely woman. Miss White's face was in total shock! She glanced up at Steve, then down, then up. Suddenly, her face broke into a radiant smile. The smartest boy in the seventh grade had just passed his first test! From that moment nothing was the same for Steve. Life at home remained the same, but life still changed. He discovered that not only could he learn, but he was good at it! He discovered that he could understand and retain knowledge, and that he could translate the things he learned into his own life. Steve began to excel! And he continued this course throughout his school life. After high-school Steve enlisted in the Navy, and he had a successful military career. During that time, he met the love of his life, he raised a family, and he graduated from college Magna Cum Laude. During his Naval career, he inspired many young people, who without him, might not have believed in themselves. Steve began a second career after the Navy, and he continues to inspire others, as an adjunct professor  in a nearby college.  Miss White left a great legacy.

It is especially during these times, that you must find the strength to help your friend. And it is during these times that your friendship will be made stronger.  And you must always be happy for their successes, even when things are not going too well for you. It might be hard to do this, but it s something that you need to learn. Think about all the sacrifices your friend has made for you and all the times when he was happy for you despite his own troubles. Think about all the happy times you enjoyed and the sad, difficult times you went through together. That should give you plenty of patience to actually be a true friend. Remember, true friends are the next best thing to family. They will always be your supporters. True friendships are hard to achieve because   _  .", "subject": ""}

{"answer": 2, "choices": ["she (he) is boring", "she (he) is busy", "she (he) is very tired", "she (he) is angry"], "question": "Back in the old days, when I was a child, we sat around the family roundtable at dinnertime and exchanged our daily experiences. It wasn't very organized, but everyone was recognized and all the news that had to be told was told by each family member. We listened to each other and the interest was not put-on; it was real. Our family was a unit and we supported each other, and nurtured each other, and liked each other, and--we were even willing to admit--we loved each other. Today, the family roundtable has moved to the local fast-food restaurant and talk is not easy, much less encouraged. Grandma, who used to live upstairs, is now. the voice on long distance, and the working parent is far too beaten down each day to spend evening relaxation time listening to the sandbox experience of an eager four-year-old. So family conversation is as extinct as my old toys and parental questions such as \"What have you been doing, Bobby?\" have been replaced by \"I'm busy, go watch television. \" And watch TV they do; count them by the millions. But it's usually not children's television that children watch. Saturday morning, the children's hour, amounts to only about 8 percent of their weekly viewing. Where are they to be found? Watching adult television, of course, from the Match Game in the morning, to the afternoon at General Hospital, from the muggings and battles on the evening news right through the family hour and past into Starsky and Hutch. That's where you find our kids, over five million of them, at 10 p. m. , not fewer than a million until after midnight! All of this is done with parental permission.

{"answer": 3, "choices": ["instruction of experts", "indication of teachers", "direction of engineers", "judgment of our own"], "question": "Back in the old days, when I was a child, we sat around the family roundtable at dinnertime and exchanged our daily experiences. It wasn't very organized, but everyone was recognized and all the news that had to be told was told by each family member. We listened to each other and the interest was not put-on; it was real. Our family was a unit and we supported each other, and nurtured each other, and liked each other, and--we were even willing to admit--we loved each other. Today, the family roundtable has moved to the local fast-food restaurant and talk is not easy, much less encouraged. Grandma, who used to live upstairs, is now. the voice on long distance, and the working parent is far too beaten down each day to spend evening relaxation time listening to the sandbox experience of an eager four-year-old. So family conversation is as extinct as my old toys and parental questions such as \"What have you been doing, Bobby?\" have been replaced by \"I'm busy, go watch television. \" And watch TV they do; count them by the millions. But it's usually not children's television that children watch. Saturday morning, the children's hour, amounts to only about 8 percent of their weekly viewing. Where are they to be found? Watching adult television, of course, from the Match Game in the morning, to the afternoon at General Hospital, from the muggings and battles on the evening news right through the family hour and past into Starsky and Hutch. That's where you find our kids, over five million of them, at 10 p. m. , not fewer than a million until after midnight! All of this is done with parental permission.

Until just a few days before, she had been with her mother, walking through the sweeping grasslands of Tsavo National Park in the African country of Kenya. The baby's mother was killed, most likely by a poacher. On Wednesday, November 17,2010, an anti-poaching team was removing the deadly wire traps that poachers set throughout the park. Luckily, a member of the team spotted the baby and rushed to help her. Suddenly, a lion sprang from the bushes and clamped its mouth around her neck. One person managed to pull out his gun and fire shots in the air. The shocked lion released the baby and backed away. Now the weakened baby had a grave wound on her neck. About 300 miles north of Tsavo is a place that helps baby elephants. Over the years, the orphanage has raised 130 elephants and successfully released them back into the wild. After a tense wait and a plane ride, the baby's rescuers made it to the orphanage. The medical staff worked frantically to treat her wound. She was scared and wild. She screamed, and wouldn't let any humans get near her, refusing to eat or drink. After two hours of intense medical care, Ishanga awoke and slowly struggled to her feet. Two keepers and a veterinarian had been with her all night. They were relieved that she seemed to be recovering. The next day, though Ishanga remained weak, her keepers introduced her to some of the other 14 young elephants living at the orphanage. The keepers stood back as the other elephants extended their trunk in friendly greetings. The older elephants led Ishanga around, giving her a tour of her new home. Over the past year, Ishanga's wounds have healed. She has made many friends. It'll be up to Ishanga to decide when she's ready to leave the orphanage.

Resting motionless, I could see the sun through my closed eyelids, alone in the sky, as lonely as I, and as motionless and silent as everything else. The earth had surely stopped turning and somewhere on this planet there was supposed to be roaring traffic in busy streets. What a crazy, unbelievable thought! Another coconut fell, to make the world come to a complete standstill. I had to roll over onto my stomach to feel that at least I could move and make noises. Then I found company. A little brown ant was struggling to find its way with a bit of dry straw through the jungle of leaves and grass below my nose. I wondered if I could give the little fellow a lift with its burden, but it showed not the slightest sign of tiredness and struggled on with all six legs, head first or head last, waving its feelers energetically as if the trip had just started.

Her fondest dream was to become a fairy godmother. She had been going to the Fairy Godmother Academy for 103 years, learning fairy godmother magic: how to turn pumpkins into coaches, how to make things vanish in clouds of smoke, even how to change mice into horses and footmen. Just that very morning the principal of the Academy had said Wanda was ready for her final test. She was to change the first animal she met into something else. The animal was to be so happy at becoming whatever it became that it would say, \"Oh, happy day! I'm a...\" If it did, Wanda would pass the test. She would become a fairy godmother, with a sparkling pink dress, a golden crown, and a magic wand tipped with a shining star. However, if she failed, she would have to start school all over again--all 103 years of it. \"Good luck,\" the principal said as Wanda left the Academy. The very first animal Wanda bumped into was Charley, a little green frog who sat in a pond by the side of the road catching bugs with his long, sticky tongue and croaking \"Baroomp! Baroomp!\" When Charley saw Wanda he jumped onto a lily pad. \"Hi,\" he cried. \"Witch way are you going? Ha, ha. That's a joke, Wanda. 'Witch way are you going?' Get it?\" \"I get it, Charley,\" replied Wanda, \"but it's not much of a joke. Anyway, I'm glad you're here. I have a surprise for you. You'll be so happy.\" Then, without even an \"if you please,\" Wanda waved her wand, said a magic word, and poof  ! Charley, the little green frog, turned into a prince! He was a handsome prince but a wet one. The lily pad had collapsed under his weight and dumped him into the water. Charley-turned-prince stood up and looked at his reflection in the water. \"Hey!\" he cried. \"You turned me into a prince! It's a surprise all right, but I don't want to be a prince. I want to be a frog! Change me back right now!\" \"Oh, dear,\" Wanda said. \"You know I don't like to be yelled at, Charley. Now you've made me forget the reverse spell. But who wouldn't rather be a prince than a frog?\" \"I wouldn't!\" cried Charley. \"I want to be a frog!\" He stuck out his tongue, missing a bug flying by the end of his nose. \"Look at that, Wanda! I was such a good fly catcher. And I had eyes on top of my head, too. I could see forward and backward and sideways all at once, but look at me now. With my eyes in front of my face, I can only see one direction at a time. I don't even have a castle, Wanda. What kind of prince is that? I'd really rather be a frog. Please change me back!\" \"I can't, Charley. But you'll learn to be happy as a prince. As for a castle, I can take care of that.\" She waved her wand, and suddenly a castle appeared by the banks of the pond. It had stone walls, oaken doors, and pennants waving from its turrets. \"Your very own palace, Charley! You'll have servants, eat fancy foods and ice cream.\" \"Bah!\" Charley interrupted. \"Who wants servants, or ice cream and fancy foods? I want bugs!\" He stuck out his tongue and looked down his nose at it, cross-eyed. \"This tongue is no good--it's too short!\" he cried. \"I can't even see it.\" Again Wanda waved her wand. \"Look, Charley, musicians,\" she said. Out of the castle marched dozens of musicians blowing trumpets, tootling flutes, and banging drums. \"See? Your own band. They'll play music, and you can sing and dance and snap your fingers to your heart's content.\" \"I don't want to sing and dance!\" Charley cried. \"And why would I do something as silly as snapping my fingers?\" \"Snapping fingers!\" exclaimed Wanda. \"That's it, Charley. That's what I forgot!\" She snapped her fingers, cried \"Upsi-doodle!\" and poof! The castle and musicians disappeared and the prince became a little green frog. Charley hopped onto a lily pad. He looked at himself in the water. \"You did it, Wanda. Oh, happy day! I'm a frog.\" Wanda smiled and thought to herself, \"So I have to go back to school for another 103 years. Who cares? Charley's happy, and that's what really counts.\" Well, it wasn't exactly 'Oh, happy day! I'm a prince,' but the principal of the Fairy Godmother Academy decided that 'Oh, happy day! I'm a frog' was close enough. Wanda hadn't thought about herself. She had only wanted to make Charley happy. Thinking about others was the most important thing fairy godmothers had to do.

Scientists say time is running out. To escape from the worst effects, global CO2 emissions need to be cut from the levels they were at in 2000 by 50 to 85 percent by 2050. But in recent years climate change talks have been bogged down by arguments over  who will pay the bill for cleaner technology. Developing countries are worried that the cut in emissions will slow their economic development. \"Chinawill play a responsible and constructive role in the meeting,\" said Chinese Premier Wen Jiabao. The nation is now the world's second largest greenhouse gas emitter  .\"However, developed nations should help developing nations deal with the global issue.\" What is China's attitude towards dealing with problems of climate change?", "subject": ""}

You've probably even experienced it: basketball players shaking hands after four quarters of knocking each other around, tennis players leaping over the net to shake hands with their opponents    after a hard-fought match, soccer players exchanging sport shirts after an intense 90 minutes, even boxers touching gloves at the beginning of each round, then hugging each other after beating each other into a pulp for 12 rounds. It seems like competitors in every event, from spelling bees to hockey, behave this way. What's going on? It's all part of sportsmanship, a great tradition in sports and competition that means playing clean and handling both victory and defeat with grace, style, and dignity. What is sportsmanship? Sportsmanship is defined as: playing fair, following the rules of the game, respecting the judgment of referees and officials, treating opponents with respect. Some people define good sportsmanship as the \"golden rule\" of sports --- in other words, treating the people you play with and against as you'd like to be treated yourself. You demonstrate good sportsmanship when you show respect for yourself, your teammates, and your opponents, for the coaches on both sides, and for the referees, judges, and other officials. But sportsmanship isn't just reserved for the people on the field. Cheerleaders and fans also need to be aware of how they behave during competition. Sportsmanship is a style and an attitude; and it can have a positive influence on everyone around you. Learning good sportsmanship means finding that the positive attitude learned on the field carries over into other areas of life. At school, for example, you're able to appreciate the contributions made by classmates and know how to work as part of a team to complete a project.

You've probably even experienced it: basketball players shaking hands after four quarters of knocking each other around, tennis players leaping over the net to shake hands with their opponents    after a hard-fought match, soccer players exchanging sport shirts after an intense 90 minutes, even boxers touching gloves at the beginning of each round, then hugging each other after beating each other into a pulp for 12 rounds. It seems like competitors in every event, from spelling bees to hockey, behave this way. What's going on? It's all part of sportsmanship, a great tradition in sports and competition that means playing clean and handling both victory and defeat with grace, style, and dignity. What is sportsmanship? Sportsmanship is defined as: playing fair, following the rules of the game, respecting the judgment of referees and officials, treating opponents with respect. Some people define good sportsmanship as the \"golden rule\" of sports --- in other words, treating the people you play with and against as you'd like to be treated yourself. You demonstrate good sportsmanship when you show respect for yourself, your teammates, and your opponents, for the coaches on both sides, and for the referees, judges, and other officials. But sportsmanship isn't just reserved for the people on the field. Cheerleaders and fans also need to be aware of how they behave during competition. Sportsmanship is a style and an attitude; and it can have a positive influence on everyone around you. Learning good sportsmanship means finding that the positive attitude learned on the field carries over into other areas of life. At school, for example, you're able to appreciate the contributions made by classmates and know how to work as part of a team to complete a project. You may enjoy more success at work as well, because a big part of learning good sportsmanship is learning to be respectful of others, including customers and co-workers.

It is the day when everyone goes back home to spend the day with his family, to have the traditional Thanksgiving dinner of roast turkey, to talk about old times. This is a story of Thanksgiving Day and of one man's efforts, under rather special circumstances, to carry on these traditions. Old Pete took his seat this day on his usual bench in Union Square. Every Thanksgiving Day for nine years, Pete had taken this same seat exactly at one o'clock, and each time the same pleasant thing had happened. But this time Pete had come here more from habit than from hunger. Certainly today Pete was not hungry. He had just had a dinner so enormous that he could hardly breathe. The buttons on his ragged shirt and coat were about to burst. He was so full of soup, oysters, roast turkey, apple pie, ice cream, and a dozen other rich foods that the November breeze and the first light fall of snow felt cool and pleasant to his face. The meal had been completely unexpected. He had been passing one of the large homes on Fifth Avenue, where there lived two rich old ladies. It seems that it was their custom each Thanksgiving to place a servant at the front entrance with orders to bring in the first hungry looking person that passed and then give him a Thanksgiving dinner of everything he could eat. On this particular Thanksgiving Day, Pete had passed, the servant had brought him in, and, before Pete knew it, he was being served like a king with more food than he could eat. Pete sat on the bench now, hardly able to move. He happened to look to the left and there in the distance he saw the Old Gentleman coming toward him. He wanted to get up and run, but he was so full of food that he stayed right there. Every Thanksgiving Day for nine years, the Old Gentleman had come here, and found Pete on this same bench, and then taken him to a restaurant and bought him a Thanksgiving dinner. It was a kind of tradition which the Old Gentleman, who had no family and lived alone, had tried to continue. The old man was tall and thin and sixty years old. He was aristocratic looking and he always dressed in black. His hair was whiter and thinner than it had been the year before, and he leaned more heavily on his cane than he used to. \"How do you do!\" said the Old Gentleman. \"I am glad to see that the changes of another year have permitted you to move in health through this beautiful world.\" Each time the Old Gentleman had said exactly this same thing. It was part of the tradition. Old Pete, too, began to feel as though he himself was now a part of the tradition, and he therefore did not have the courage to tell the old man that he had already eaten. This dinner seemed to mean so much to the Old Gentleman. \"Thank you, sir,\" said Old Pete at last. \"I'll go with you gladly. I'm very hungry sir.\" Together the Old Gentleman and Pete walked south to the same restaurant where each year Pete had his Thanksgiving dinner. They sat at the same table. The Old Gentleman seemed pleased and happy. When the waiter brought dish after dish of food to Pete, the Old Gentleman sat quietly and smiled. Under the circumstance, Pete had to eat. It was part of the tradition, and so he ate like a hero. Soup, oysters, roast turkey, pie, he ate everything, although when he entered the restaurant even the smell of more food almost made him sick. At last Pete leaned back with the battle won. \"Thank you sir,\" he said, with some effort, \" for a fine dinner.\" They parted as they did each year at the door, the Old Gentleman going south, Pete north. Around the corner, Pete stopped for a moment, felt a terrible pain in his stomach, then fell to the sidewalk unconscious. A little later an ambulance came. In the hospital they discovered that he had had an attack of indigestion. An hour later, another ambulance brought the Old Gentleman to the same hospital. At first they thought it was also indigestion but later one of the nurses said, \"That nice old gentleman over there-- you wouldn't think that it was a case of starvation.

The WHO said there was now a \"real need\" to focus on cancer prevention by cutting down smoking, obesity and drinking.

Fourteen million people a year are diagnosed with cancer, but that is predicted to increase to 19 million by 2025, 22 million by 2030 and 24 million by 2035.

Dr Chris Wild, the director of the WHO's International Agency for Research on Cancer, told the BBC: \"The global cancer burden is increasing quite markedly, due predominately to the ageing of the populations and population growth.

{"answer": 2, "choices": ["the joke is well chosen", "you have complete confidence in your listeners' sense of humor", "only you and your best friend are involved in the conversation", "the audience consists of your colleagues and acquaintances"], "question": "What is funny? The short answer is: Who knows? The joke that causes a burst of laughter from one listener might be met with a puzzled look from another. In general, you should avoid jokes at any business or social gathering where there are more than two people in your conversational group. If there are only two people -- and they consist of you and your best friend -- go ahead and tell it. Admittedly, a few people possess a perfect sense of timing, appropriateness, and joke delivery. You are probably not one of them. You might be quite funny and have many great jokes. But there's a place for jokes -- over dinner with family, hiking with friends, but business or social affairs with colleagues and acquaintances   are not it. It takes a whole other level of joke-telling ability to put a joke into the more formal conversations. The best jokes come into the conversation so that by the time listeners realize a joke is in progress, the punchline that produces humour is being delivered -- to their surprise and delight. Jokes don't translate well when you're in a group with mixed backgrounds: those whose first language is not English, those who might not understand a special term or an \"in\" expression, young people who wouldn't catch a reference to some bit of culture familiar to older people -- and vice versa  . Never joke about another person in the group -- about their name, habits, hometown, profession, appearance, or past. It's not a question of whether the joke is cheery or appropriate. No one enjoys being singled out this way. When you are the subject of the joke, the laughter doesn't feel good no matter how hard you try to tell yourself they're not laughing at you. Because that's what it feels like. What do you say if you realize your joke upset someone? Apologize as briefly and as sincerely as you can, and hope that someone changes the subject. Try saying: \"I'm sorry. I should have known better\" or \"I'm sorry. I wasn't thinking.\" What do you do if people don't get your joke or don't appear to find it as funny as you do? First, do not retell it, only louder this time, hoping the point of the joke will be seen. Second, don't try to push people to get it. People do not like people whose jokes they don't understand. They feel stupid and need to blame someone. If you want to leave with the goodwill of your listeners, say something to make them feel less foolish. You could say: \"I don't know why I tell jokes when I'm so poor at it.\" The world needs laughter, and good humour is a success wherever it goes, so this caveat   about joke-telling is not meant to dampen high spirits or to advocate dull conversation. If you're a gifted story-teller and you know people love your jokes, go for it. We need your kind. The rest of us will save our jokes for family and close friends.

The short answer is: Who knows? The joke that causes a burst of laughter from one listener might be met with a puzzled look from another. In general, you should avoid jokes at any business or social gathering where there are more than two people in your conversational group. If there are only two people -- and they consist of you and your best friend -- go ahead and tell it. Admittedly, a few people possess a perfect sense of timing, appropriateness, and joke delivery. You are probably not one of them. You might be quite funny and have many great jokes. But there's a place for jokes -- over dinner with family, hiking with friends, but business or social affairs with colleagues and acquaintances   are not it. It takes a whole other level of joke-telling ability to put a joke into the more formal conversations. The best jokes come into the conversation so that by the time listeners realize a joke is in progress, the punchline that produces humour is being delivered -- to their surprise and delight. Jokes don't translate well when you're in a group with mixed backgrounds: those whose first language is not English, those who might not understand a special term or an \"in\" expression, young people who wouldn't catch a reference to some bit of culture familiar to older people -- and vice versa  . Never joke about another person in the group -- about their name, habits, hometown, profession, appearance, or past. It's not a question of whether the joke is cheery or appropriate. No one enjoys being singled out this way. When you are the subject of the joke, the laughter doesn't feel good no matter how hard you try to tell yourself they're not laughing at you.

Try saying: \"I'm sorry. I should have known better\" or \"I'm sorry. I wasn't thinking.\" What do you do if people don't get your joke or don't appear to find it as funny as you do? First, do not retell it, only louder this time, hoping the point of the joke will be seen. Second, don't try to push people to get it. People do not like people whose jokes they don't understand.

A full moon occurred on December 2. It will appear again on Thursday in time for the New Year's countdown. The New Year's Eve blue moon will be visible in the United States, Canada, Europe, South America and Africa.

New Year's Eve blue moons are rarer, occurring every 19 years.

Her father was a rich sugar businessman at the time. Because her parents thought boys and girls should be equal, Elizabeth received the same education as her brothers. In 1832, her father's business was destroyed by fire, so her family moved to New York City. But her father's business there failed. Then in 1837, the family moved to Cincinnati, Ohio. Not long after, her father died. After her father's death, Elizabeth, at the age of 16, had to go to work. When she was 24, she visited her dying friend Mary. Her friend said, \"You're young and strong, you should become a doctor.\" That was nearly impossible for a woman in the middle of the nineteenth century. But she knew this was what she was going to do. After several rejections from medical schools, she finally was accepted by Geneva Medical College. By studying hard, she graduated successfully in 1849. After graduating from medical school, she went to Paris to learn more about medicine. She wanted to be a surgeon, but a serious eye problem forced her to give up the idea. When she returned to America in 1851, she found it difficult to start her own practice because she was a woman. In 1857, Elizabeth and her sister, also a doctor, along with another woman doctor, managed to open a new hospital, the first for women and children. Besides, she also set up the first medical school for women in 1868, where she taught the women students about disease prevention. It was the first time that the idea of preventing disease was taught in a medical school. Elizabeth Blackwell started the British National Health Society in 1871, which helped people learn how to stay healthy. In 1889, Elizabeth Blackwell became the first woman doctor in the United States. Most importantly, she fought for the admission of women to medical colleges. Elizabeth Blackwell died on May 3, 1910, when she was 89.She opened a world of chances for women. She always fought for what was right in all her life. In 1949 the Blackwell medal was established.

At these points materials from across the sea enter the United States, and the products of the land are sent there for export across the sea. We know that places where transportation lines meet are good places for making raw materials into finished goods. That is why seaports often have cities nearby. But cities like New York needed more than their geographical location in order to become great industrial centers.

Most of us might think of crowds of teenagers in a 1950's movie house watching Bwana Devil in 3-D. But 3-D technology made its first appearance on the scene in 1838 with the first stereoscope . And the first actual 3-D movie was a 1903 film called Le Ariveed'un Train. Although it has such a long history, the technology has still remained based on one simple principle-----to make 3-D effects you must find a way to project two slightly different pictures to each eye. Modern 3-D technology works by rapidly flickering  two versions of the movie and projecting them onto each eye. The brain does the rest of the work, combining the two pictures together into one and giving the show the appearance of depth, the third dimension. But does this exposure, especially long exposures, cause harm to the child's developing brain and visual system? Unfortunately, long-term studies on new flicker digital 3-D technology and children aren't yet available. We do not know if regular or daily 3-D viewing over years affects the developing visual system, although older 3-D methods basically do the same thing and are not considered harmful. The question of possible harm in modern 3-D use in TV is really based on two facts: the amount of time children will now be watching 3-D TV each day and the sensitivity some children show in reaction to 3-D viewing. It is difficult to make actual lab studies of longer term 3-D viewing in children because of the possible harm of the experiment. Researchers will have to wait until 3-D TV technology is already in the marketplace for a number of years, then check heavy 3-D TV watchers and compare them with non-watchers. With a 3-D television technology in the home, we will soon be able to answer the question of whether or not longer and more frequent periods of 3-D exposure cause more changes in the visual system.

Another problem could be that a foreign language taught in schools can sound quite different to what native speakers actually use.

I'm fine, thank you, and you?\" I appreciate that although this greeting is much too formal for everyday use - it's easy to learn and helps build confidence. However, it can be a hard habit to break. I've seen many parents correct their kids if they don't use that exact phrase, as if simply replying \"I'm fine\" would somehow be rude. In fact I'm banning my students from saying that in the classroom, insisting a simple \"I'm fine, thanks\" is good enough. \"Seldom\" is another one that I find interesting. The first time a student told me \"I seldom watch TV\", my initial reaction was a stupefied look, followed by \"Huh?\" I then realized the student used \"seldom\" when it's more common for us to use \"rarely.\" I was just as confused when I first heard a toilet referred to as a WC (water closet), another English term I'd never heard of back in Australia.

But how do American presidents spend their vacation time? Let's take a look! Franklin D. Roosevelt, considered one of the greatest presidents in American history, had limited vacation options because of his polio . He began visiting Warm Springs, Georgia in 1924 for its curative waters and later built a 2,000 acre polio treatment center nearby. He liked to cruise the Potomacon his yacht  and three times as president returned to his beloved Canadian island of Campobello, with which he fell in love as a kid. Former President Bill Clinton, however, was never much good at vacationing. His staff had to practically force him to go on vacation his first year in office; his idea of relaxing was reading four good books simultaneously  while enjoying a cigar (chewed, not smoked). He could also lose himself in a game of golf, where his somewhat flexible interpretation of the rules could at times drive his partners crazy. Obama's predecessor  also knows how to relax. Fishing is in the Bush family DNA: for blue sharks off the coast of Maine or anything with fins, almost anywhere else. George W. Bush also relaxed as president by jogging and clearing brush on his Texas ranch. Since leaving office, he has become an active mountain biker and, more recently, has taken up painting. Obama tends to take a winter break in Hawaii, where he was born and raised, and a summer vacation in Martha's Vineyard, off the southern coast of Cape Cod, Massachusetts. In between, he plays basketball every couple of weeks and has been known to do some skeet shooting at Camp David. Obama's favorite pastime, no matter the location, has become easy to spot: golf. What's special when Bill Clinton was playing golf?", "subject": ""}

The oldest part of the university was built in the 13th century while the newest was founded in the mid 1960s.The number of the students is so great that many students live in lodgings and move into college for their final year.

The heart of Cambridge has shops,pubs,and supermarkets,but most of it is university-colleges,departments,libraries,clubs and other places for university staff and students. Students fill the shops,cafes,banks and churches,making these as well part of the university. With over 10,000 undergraduates and postgraduates, the town is a busy place indeed. Students here are not allowed to keep cars.

{"answer": 0, "choices": ["Some people are happy to accept genetic causes for their behavior.", "We are close to finding solutions to human weaknesses.", "The public wants scientists to help fight against illnesses.", "Americans became depressed at an early age for genetic causes."], "question": "Just about every week now, we read a newspaper headline about the genetic basis for breast cancer, intelligence, orobesity. Such news stories may lead us to believe our lives are being _ by genetic discoveries. We may be close to changing and getting rid of mental illness, for example and identify the causes of crime,personality, and other basichuman weaknesses. But these hopes, it turns out, are based on faulty assumptions about genes and behavior.  In many cases, people are motivated to accept research claims by the hope of finding solutions for frightening problems, like breast cancer. Accepting genetic causes for their characteristics can relieve guilt about behavior they want to change but can't. Efforts made to fight against them, at growing expense, have made little or no visible progress. The public wants to hear that science can help. Meanwhile, genetic claims are being made for many ordinary and abnormal behaviors, from addictiontoshynessand even to political views anddivorce. If who we are is determined from pregnancy, then our efforts to change or to influence our children may be useless. There may also be no basis for insisting that people behave themselves and obey laws. Thus, the revolution in thinking about genes has great consequences for how we view ourselves as human beings. Most claims linking emotional disorders and behaviors to genes are statistical in nature. The research finds are insufficient for deciding that alcoholism or manic-depression   is inherited. In the late 1980s, genes for manic-depression were identified by teamsof geneticists. The claims have now been definitively proved wrong. Genetic data on the major mental illnesses make it clear that they can't be reduced to purely genetic causes. According to Myrna Weissman, Ph.D., Americans born before 1905 had a 1 percent rate of depression by age 75. Among Americans born a half century later, 6 percent become depressed by age 24! Similarly, while the average age at which manic-depression first appears was 32 in the mid 1960s, its average beginning today is 19. Only social factors can produce such large shifts in rate and age of beginning of mental disorders in a few decades. Scientists actively debate whether disorders like alcoholismare more or less biologically driven. If they are mainly biological--rather than psychological, social, and cultural--then there may be a genetic basis for them. In 1990,Kenneth Blum, Ph.D., of the University of Texas, and Ernest Noble, M.D., of the University of California, Los Angeles, found a certain gene in 70 percent of a group of alcoholics, but in only 20 percent of a non-alcoholic group. But in 1993 Joel Gelernter, M.D., of Yale and his colleagues surveyed all the studies that examined this gene and alcoholism. Different from Blum andNoble'sresearch, the results were that 18 percent of non-alcoholics, 18 percent of problem drinkers, and 18 percent of severe alcoholics all had the gene. As for Blum and Noble's work, a more reasonable model is that genes may affect how people experience alcohol. Perhaps some people's nerves are more activated by alcohol. But although genes can influence reactions to alcohol, they cannot explain why some people continue drinking to the point of destroying their lives. Therefore, claims that our genes cause our problems, our misbehavior, even our personalities are more a mirror of our culture's attitudes than a window for human understanding and change.

{"answer": 1, "choices": ["human made cats pets as early as 9,500 years ago", "human interacted with cats very early", "cats didn't appear until prehistoric Cyprus", "when cats became domesticated"], "question": "Although cats may be one of the most popular pets today, little is known about how and when humans and cats set up their close relationship. The earliest evidence for human-cat interaction dates back to prehistoric Cyprus , where the remains of a wild cat and a human -- dated 9,500 years old -- were found buried together. A new study in the Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences has confirmed the first direct evidence of a human-domestic cat relationship among Chinese farmers 5,300 years ago. Researchers studied the bones of cats, dogs, deer and other animals unearthed in an excavation   near a village in Central China. By using some ways, scientists showed that the cats were living on a mostly millet -based diet, just like the domesticated dogs and pigs from the site. \"The most reasonable explanation for a high consumption of millet-based food is that the cats had formed a stable and mutual relationship with humans and could easily feed on rodents   around human villages, find leftover food or even have been fed by people intentionally,\" said Hu Yaowu from the Chinese Academy of Sciences in Beijing, whose research focuses on the relationship between humans and domesticated animals. \"It is very interesting for us to find the consumption of millet-based foods by the cats, since this kind of evidence had long been missing.\" Hu explains. Since cats usually eat meat, such a diet would be unexpected, unless the cats were being fed by people, the study argues. The researchers also found that one of the cats survived to reach old age, implying that it had a safe place to live and enough to eat. Why the farmers wanted to keep cats nearby or make them \"pets\" could be answered by other evidence. Chinese archaeologists found some storage containers were specifically designed to keep out rodents -- a vermin   that cats could certainly have helped with.

I don't know if you can call it running away when it was only an hour away from my home.But once I entered the fair grounds, I crossed over into another world.The loudspeaker offered background music over the sounds of people talking, bargaining and food sellers yelling for your attention. I belonged here.I didn't know if I had it in my blood or not, but I always wanted to have a small food stand and travel in my off season from fair to fair selling goodies.Perhaps one day.It certainly wasn't a priority in my life , Perhaps it should be. After I was there a while, I needed to get away to a quiet spot.Most of the time, I could find that anywhere the farm animals were kept. They needed the quiet.So I went there to find peace with the cows, goats, horses, pigs and yes, the turkeys.You'd think being this close to \"Thanksgiving\", they'd be a little scared, but they were not. It was in the dairy barn where I found peace this time.I so admired the young folks who tended to farm animals.I thought they had a greater appreciation for life.They participated in it firsthand.I once watched a young farmer help bring a baby cow into the world.

The Nobel Prize in Literature 2012 is awarded to Chinese writer Mo Yan \"who with hallucinatory realism merges folk tales, history and the contemporary,\" said Englund at a press conference. Mo Yan, a pseudonym for Guan Moye, was born in 1955 and grew up in Gaomi in Shandong province in eastern China.His parents were farmers. As a 12-year-old during the Cultural Revolution he left school to work, first in agriculture, later in a factory.In 1976 he joined the People's Liberation Army and during this time began to study literature and write.His first short story was published in a literary journal in 1981. \"In his writing, Mo Yan draws on his youthful experiences and on settings in the province of his birth.This is apparent in his novel Hong gaoliang jiazu (1987, in English Red Sorghum 1993),\" said the academy in a statement of Mo's biography. The book consists of five stories that unfold and interweave in Gaomi in several turbulent decades in the 20th century, with depictions of bandit culture, the Japanese occupation and the harsh conditions endured by poor farm workers, according to the biography.Red Sorghum was successfully filmed in 1987, directed by famous Chinese director Zhang Yimou. Through a mixture of fantasy and reality, historical and social perspectives, Mo Yan has created a world reminiscent in its complexity of those in the writings of William Faulkner and Gabriel Garcia Marquez, at the same time finding a departure point in old Chinese literature and in oral tradition, the academy commented in the biographical statement. In addition to his novels, Mo Yan has published many short stories and essays on various topics.In spite of his social criticism, he is seen in his homeland as one of the foremost contemporary authors, the statement added. Dozens of his works have been translated into English, French and Japanese and many other languages. Last year's literature prize went to Swedish poet Tomas Transtromer.

Dozens of his works have been translated into English, French and Japanese and many other languages. Last year's literature prize went to Swedish poet Tomas Transtromer. Alfred Nobel, a Swedish industrialist who invented dynamite, established the Nobel Prizes in his will in 1895.The first awards were handed out six years later.

There is a tendency to exclude kids from the holiday preparations for many reasons: we want everything to be perfect or maybe we don't trust that they'll do it right. However, involving kids in holiday preparations can be good for them, as well as fun for you. Kid-created decorations are often the best part of any holiday table.

I was 18 and it was fresher  week. I was at the beginning of a course in English Literature and full of enthusiasm for my subject. She was also 18 and enrolled in a course in physics. \"Your major is of no use to society. What will you do with it when you graduate, other than teach? Plus, you're going to be poor your whole life,\" she said. \"You have no soul and your degree is boring. I don't care how much money you're going to earn. I'd rather be poor and don't mind being a teacher. If I love my work I'll have something far more meaningful than a big bank account!\" came the reply. And so it went, back and forth, neither of us giving the other an inch, each of us stubbornly committed to our prejudice. We were both ignorant, but our ignorance was also society's ignorance. It had always been that way. Scientists mocked  humanists; humanists laughed at scientists. Back in the 1960s, the physicist-turned novelist C. P. Snow labeled the sciences-humanities divide \"a problem of 'the two cultures'\" . He said it was bad for society. The modern world needed well-rounded people. I think I know better now, but it would have helped if we had been encouraged to think a little more outside our science and arts \"boxes\". That's why I believe it is healthy that China is beginning a debate on whether it's wise for young people to have to choose which direction their careers - and lives - will take at such an early age. At the moment, in their second year of high school, students must choose either the sciences or the humanities. After making the choice, they focus their energies on passing the appropriate college entrance exam. But now, people in China are asking: Is this forced, early decision good for young people or society? Young people need time to explore, to discover where their real talents and interests lie. There are more than just a few middle-aged people out there, stuck in jobs they hate because they made the wrong choice at the wrong time. And from the point of view of society, isn't it better for students to delay a while before they decide what to study? Scientists can benefit from learning to develop the critical skills associated with the humanities; students in the humanities, surely, only stand to gain by finding out a little more about science and technology, which are so important to the future of a developing country like China. With any luck, in the future young people fresh to college will be better informed about the possibilities of education than people of my generation.

As growing up, I thought everyone ate dinner as a family. However, now I realized that is not the case. In fact, most families eat dinner together only about four times a week and 10% of families only eat together twice a week. And as children get older and the number of activities they are involved in increases, the meals eaten as a family decrease. Studies show that families who eat dinner together benefits in a variety of ways. Eating together helps families achieve better communication, children do better in school and are better adjusted, and the entire family enjoys better nutrition . Increased Communication Eating dinner together as a family provides opportunities for communication. A \"Family Dinner Experiment \" conducted by Oprah Winfrey in 1993 challenged five families to eat dinner together every night for a month for at least half an hour. At first the families found it difficult but by the end of the study they wanted to continue eating dinner together. The biggest surprise for the parents was \"How much their children treasured the dependence time with their parents at the table.\" Superior Academic Performance Family meals also help improve school performance. A 1994 survey by Louis Harris and Associates had 2000 seniors take an academic test and answer a list of personal questions. Researchers found that \"Students who regularly ate dinner with their families four or more times a week scored better than those who ate family dinners three or fewer times a week. These results crossed racial  lines and were a greater indicator than whether the child was in a one or two-parent family.\" Better Adjusted A study by Drs. Bowden and Zeisz found that \"the teens who were best adjusted ate a meal with an adult in their family at an average of 5.4 days a week, compared to 3.3 days for teens who didn't show good adjustment.\" The well-adjusted teens were \"less likely to do drugs or be depressed and were more motivated at school and had better relationships.\" Dr. Bowen said, \"that mealtimes were a sort of 'marker' for other positive family attributes and seemed to play an important role in helping teens deal well with the stresses of adolescence  .\" According to the \"Family Dinner Experiment\" in 1993, what surprised the parents was that   _  .", "subject": ""}

In fact, most families eat dinner together only about four times a week and 10% of families only eat together twice a week. And as children get older and the number of activities they are involved in increases, the meals eaten as a family decrease. Studies show that families who eat dinner together benefits in a variety of ways. Eating together helps families achieve better communication, children do better in school and are better adjusted, and the entire family enjoys better nutrition . Increased Communication Eating dinner together as a family provides opportunities for communication. A \"Family Dinner Experiment \" conducted by Oprah Winfrey in 1993 challenged five families to eat dinner together every night for a month for at least half an hour. At first the families found it difficult but by the end of the study they wanted to continue eating dinner together. The biggest surprise for the parents was \"How much their children treasured the dependence time with their parents at the table.\" Superior Academic Performance Family meals also help improve school performance. A 1994 survey by Louis Harris and Associates had 2000 seniors take an academic test and answer a list of personal questions. Researchers found that \"Students who regularly ate dinner with their families four or more times a week scored better than those who ate family dinners three or fewer times a week. These results crossed racial  lines and were a greater indicator than whether the child was in a one or two-parent family.\" Better Adjusted A study by Drs. Bowden and Zeisz found that \"the teens who were best adjusted ate a meal with an adult in their family at an average of 5.4 days a week, compared to 3.3 days for teens who didn't show good adjustment.\" The well-adjusted teens were \"less likely to do drugs or be depressed and were more motivated at school and had better relationships.\" Dr. Bowen said, \"that mealtimes were a sort of 'marker' for other positive family attributes and seemed to play an important role in helping teens deal well with the stresses of adolescence  .\" Which of the following is NOT true according to the passage?", "subject": ""}

The method relies on measuring how chemical variations in drinking water show up in people's hair. \"You're what you eat and drink, and that's recorded in your hair,\" said Thure Cerling, a geologist at the University of Utah. While U.S diet is relatively identical, water supplies vary. The differences result from weather patterns. The chemical composition of rainfall changes slightly as rain clouds move. Most hydrogen and oxygen atoms in water are stable, but traces of both elements are also present as heavier isotopes  . The heaviest rain falls first. As a result, storms that form over the Pacific deliver heavier water to California than to Utah. Similar patterns exist throughout the U.S. By measuring the proportion of heavier hydrogen and oxygen isotopes along a strand of hair, scientists can construct a geographic timeline.

They were able to accurately place the hair samples in broad regions roughly corresponding to the movement of rain systems. \"It's not good for pinpointing ,\" Cerling said. \"It's good for eliminating many possibilities.\" Todd Park, a local detective, said the method has helped him learn more about an unidentified woman whose skeleton was found near Great Salt Lake.

This year, though, Kelson Poepoe, a conservationist on Hawaii's prefix = st1 /MolokaiIsland, helped publish an unusual version on this model. Poepoe and his colleagues decided to print a calendar telling people when not to fish. Many of the Homestead's residents still follow an existence lifestyle, gathering roughly one-third of their food by fishing in nearby Mo'omomi Bay. But, even though overfishing has exhausted fish populations throughout Hawaii, Mo'omomi Bay's fishery is booming, with a higher fish density  than nearly anywhere else in the main islands. The new calendar is based on the ancient fishing practices that have helped keep those populations strong. Hawaiians have long known that carefully tended resources will renew themselves. To make this process easier, fishermen traditionally worked hard to understand and adapt to fish behavior. For example, they closely monitored where and when key species gathered to reproduce, and they prevented fishing during those times. By contrast, most of today's fishermen see spawning  periods as a chance to get large numbers of fish, which can cause population break down. While these traditional methods have largely died out, they are still practiced by Poepoe and his fellow men at Mo'omomi Bay. \"We have a rule of conduct that basically says, take only what you can eat fresh, don't stock your fridge, and don't take the fish when they spawn,\" Poepoe said. In 1993, Poepoe helped found the conservation group Hui Malama Mo'omomi to teach  _ to new generations, and publishing the calendar is a key part of this move. It follows the lunar cycle, declaring when certain species are not available or \"taboo.\" It also includes helpful hints about fish lifecycles, detailing exactly where in the bay certain kinds of fish like to gather, how to tell males from females, and which fishing methods are least likely to harm fish populations long-term. So far, these methods have helped keep Mo'omomi Bay's fish number totals far higher than elsewhere in the surrounding islands. With hopes of copying this success, a number of local groups are interested in creating similar calendars for other coastal areas. But that's a difficult project, partly because fish habits are highly local, meaning that the information in the calendar applies mainly to Mo'omomi Bay.

There were cameramen down there, a whole film unit, and all the correct safety precautions had been taken. Probably the girl wasn't even a real girl, but a dummy . He opened the window and looked down. The car park, paved courts, grass spaces between the blocks, all were deserted. On the balcony rail one of the dummy's hands moved, desperately. He had to believe then what was obviously happening. The girl was trying to kill herself. She had lost her courage and now was trying to stay alive. All these thoughts and conclusions of his occupied about thirty seconds. Then he acted. He picked up the phone and dialed the emergency number for the police. The arrival of the police cars and the rescue of the girl became the focus of talk for the people of the two blocks. Someone found out that it was he who had called the police and he became an unwilling hero. He was a modest, quiet young man, and was in relief when the talk began to die away. Again he was able to enter and leave his flat without being pointed at as a kind of St George and sometimes even congratulated. About a fortnight after that morning, he was getting ready to go to the theatre, just putting on his overcoat, when the doorbell rang. He didn't recognize the girl who stood outside.

Another one must survive with his son for three days in the desert, where, because neither can cook, the two only eat instant noodles. These story lines are part of Where Are We Going, Dad? which, since its first show in October, has become one of China's most popular television shows, covering more than 600 million viewers each week. And searches for Where Are We Going, Dad? turn up over 40 million hits on Sina Weibo, China's Twitter. \"In traditional Chinese culture, the common conception of parenthood is that the father is strict and the mother is kind. But on the show, we see fathers who are much gentler on their kids and more concerned with their upbringing,\" said Li Minyi, an associate professor of early childhood education at the leading Beijing Normal University. \"An important question arises in this show for modern Chinese society -- what is the role of fathers in today's China?\" \"As they raise their children, parents are growing up at the same time,\" said Wang Renping, a popular education expert, in an interview with the Qianjiang Evening News. \"They cannot use parenting styles from 20 years ago to guide the development of children born 20 years later.\" The attraction of Where Are We Going, Dad? lies in the chance to have a close look at the lives of popular Chinese stars and their children. Audiences fancy watching the failed attempts of star dads making dinner, braiding hair , and disciplining children -- tasks often left to mothers in a society still influenced by the opinion that \"men rule outside and women rule inside.\" The reason why Where Are We Going, Dad is so popular in China may include the following EXCEPT that  _  .", "subject": ""}

They have lived in their home in the mountains since 1953, so investigating the attic was a trip down memory lane for me. I climbed the unstable ladder to the dusty, cold third floor.

As I opened each letter, I discovered a new and previously unrevealed page of my parents' lives. My father served in the Army. He wrote about his daily experiences with civilians, German POWs, baths and more. I was drawn to these letters. Each of my mother's letters was sealed with her 1944 lipstick kiss.

But I quickly dismissed this thought. My father wasn't in any kind of shape to shop for a valentine. My parents had been married for fifty-six years. My mother would understand that her valentine would just have to be skipped this year. Later that evening, Mother and I revisited the attic in search of the lost letters.

Lying separate, on top of the letters was the valentine card my father had sent Mother in 1944! The next day,Mother and I visited Daddy in the hospital. I joked with him, saying softly, \"Today is Valentine's Day, and I know you have been a little busy lately, but I've got something you covered.\"I handed him the card.

That's because this tiny bookstore that is located in Ginza, Tokyo sells only a single book at a time. Opened in May 2015, Morioka Shoten is the brainchild of Yoshiyuki Morioka. The experienced bookseller began his career as a bookstore clerk in Tokyo's Kanda district before branching out to open his own store. It was here while organizing book readings that he realized that customers usually came into the store with one title in mind. Morioka began to wonder if a store could exist by selling many copies of just one single book. In November 2014, he partnered with his two friends, to establish a unique bookstore with the idea of \"A Single Room, A Single Book.\" Like its offering, the bookstore is simple. The selections that are picked by Morioka change weekly and vary widely to attract customers with different interests. Recent choices include The True Deceiver, an award-winning Swedish novel by Tove Jansson, Hans Christian Andersen's Fairy Tales, and a collection of artist Karl Blossfeldt's photography of plants. Morioka has also chosen books written by famous Japanese authors Mimei Ogawa and Akito Akagi. To highlight his only offering, Morioka often uses clever methods. For example,when selling a book about flowers, he decorated his shop with the ones that had been mentioned in the book. He also encourages authors to hold talks and discussions so they can connect with customers. Morioka says his goal is for the customers to experience being inside a book, not just a bookstore!

Your feet ? perhaps you should try a segway! The Segway is perfect for short journeys. It's an electric vehicle that consists of a platform between two wheels, with a pole that connects the platform to the handlebars. To ride it , you step up onto the platform, and control the Segway by moving your body. Lean forwards to go faster, and back-wards to slow down. On older models, direction was controlled by a twist grip on the left handlebar. This varies the speeds between the two motors, and a decrease in the speed of the left wheel would turn the Segway to the left . With newer models you simply lean to the left or right. Meanwhile, a gyroscope  detects your movements and prevents the machine from falling over. The Segway has a maximum speed of 19 km per hour and a range of about 38 km. after that, you need to plug it and recharge the battery. Segways are used for a variety of purposes. People with mobility problems can now enjoy walks in the country with their friends and family. Some golfers see them as an alternative to the golf cart . And dog owners now have an easier way to take the dog to the park. A few police forces use Segways, too. They allow officers to move quickly while maintaining contact with the public.

A new study shows that black people and Native Hawaiians are more likely to develop lung cancer from smoking. It compared their risk to whites, Japanese, Americans and Latinos. The study, however, found almost no racial or ethnic differences among the heaviest smokers. These were people who smoked more than thirty cigarettes each day. Other comparisons have shown that blacks are more likely than whites to get lung cancer from smoking. But the scientists say few studies have compared the risks among Native Hawaiians, Asians and Latinos. Researchers at the University of Southern California and the University of Hawaii did the new study. The New England Journal of Medicine published the findings. The eight-year study involved more than 180,000 people. They provided details about their tobacco use and their diet as well as other information. They included current and former smokers and people who never smoked. Almost 2,000 people in the study developed lung cancer. Researchers say genetics might help explain the racial and ethnic differences. There could be differences in how people's bodies react to smoke. But environmental influences, including the way people smoke, could also make a difference. African-Americans and Latinos in the study reported smoking the fewest cigarettes per day. Whites were the heaviest smokers. But the scientists note that blacks have been reported to breathe cigarette smoke more deeply than white smokers. This could fill their lungs with more of the chemicals in tobacco that cause cancer. Many researchers disagree not only about the effect of race on the risk of disease, but even about the meaning of race. Yet scientists know that some diseases affect different groups differently.

The average women's brain weighs 10% less than men's. Since researches have shown that the bigger the brain, the cleverer the animal, men must be more intelligent than women. Right? Wrong. Men and women always score similarly on intelligence tests, despite the difference in brain size. Why? After years of study, researchers have concluded that it's what's inside that matters, not just the size of the brain. The brain consists of \"grey matter\" and \"white matter\". While men have more of the latter, the amount of \"thinking\" brain is almost exactly the same in both sexes. It has been suggested that smaller brain appears to work faster, perhaps because the two sides of the brain are better connected in women. This means that little girls tend to learn to speak earlier, and that women can understand sorts of information from different sources at the same time. When it comes to talking to the boss on the phone, cooking dinner and keeping an eye on the baby all at the same time, it's women who come out on top every time. There are other important differences between two sexes. As white matter is the key to spatial  tasks, men know better where things are in relation to other things. \"A great footballer always knows where he is in relation to the other players, and he knows where to go,\" says one researcher. That may explain one of life's great mysteries--why men refuse to ask for directions ... and women often need to! The differences begin when fetuses  are about nine weeks old, which can be seen in the action of children as young as one. A boy would try to climb a barrier   before him or push it down while a girl would attract help from others. These brain differences also explain the fact that more men take up jobs that require good spatial skills, while more women speech skills. It may all go back to our ancestors, among whom women needed speech skills to take care of their babies and men needed spatial skills to hunt, according to one research. www. .com If all this disappoints you, it shouldn't. \"The brain changes throughout our lives according to what we do with it.\" says a biologist.

The museum is a good way to learn about the interesting life of the American writer. William Porter rented this house in Austin and lived there with his wife Athol and daughter Margaret for about two years. Many objects in the museum belonged to the Porters. Others did not. An important piece in the room is the original photograph over here. It was taken there in the house about 1895. The piano there goes back to the 1860s. His wife took lessons on it when she first moved to Austin. Porter did not start his career as a successful writer. He worked at a farm, land office and bank. He also loved words and writing. The museumm has a special proof of Porter's love of language --- his dictionary. It is said that he had read every word in that dictionary. Later William Porter was forced to leave Austin because he was charged with financial wrongdoing at the bank and lost his job. Because he was afraid of a trail  , he left the country secretly. But he returned because his wife was dying. After her death, he faced the trial and became a criminal. He served three and a half years in a prison in Ohio.

Mr. Mountain plans to mass-produce his boat ladder. He created his invention at a workshop called TechShop. Mr. Mountain says, \"I think it encourages innovation. I think people who probably have had ideas rolling around in the back of their minds for years but have never had the opportunity to actually put them into production or even experiment with them would find this place wonderful.

{"answer": 3, "choices": ["For over 800 years.", "Since 1350", "Since l515", "For over 200 years"], "question": "From early times, man has been interested in art. People have often worked together to collect and save the world's art treasures. Fine art treasures from many countries are kept in an art museum called the Louvre   in Paris, France. The works of art have been collected by the people of France over many centuries. It is the biggest art museum in the world. The Louvre has not always been a museum. The first building was a fort. In 1190, it was the king's castle with high walls and a round tower, which had a river around it to keep out the enemies. Over the years, the number of buildings around the castle grew.

Malala is the youngest Nobel winner in history. Malala Yousafzai has never been ordinary. When she was just 11, she started blogging   about the Taliban takeover of her hometown of Mingora, Pakistan. Taliban members follow an extreme belief of Islam and forbid girls to go to school. Classrooms were closed for several months. Malala spoke out about her desire to go back to school. \"All I want is an education,\" she told one television broadcaster. Malala was later able to return to class. But she continued to blog and speak out about girls' right to education. On October 9, 2012, the Taliban tried to silence her. A gunman boarded her school bus and shot her in the head. Malala survived and showed great courage and optimism during her long recovery. At that time she became a symbol of the struggle for girls' rights all over the world. Nine months after she was shot, she gave a now-famous speech at the United Nations. \"They thought that the bullets   would silence us. But they failed,\" she said. \"And then, out of that silence came thousands of voices. ... Weakness, fear and hopelessness died. Strength, power, and courage were born.\" Malala has also become an international symbol for peace.

At one time, I was a girl who was talkative and confident. Friends around me envied me that l was always keeping a smile on my face and regarded me as a little happy swallow.     However, things have changed with the passage of time. In 2006, I failed to get into my ideal university. But I didn't want to give up, so I was determined to retake the exam in 2007. At that time, I was confident in showing my abilities.     Unfortunately, things didn't go well again. I can clearly remember that it was on August 15th of 2006 that my family received a bad news from my  s. It wasn't until then that I came to realize how much of burdens I have to bear. Having heard that my elder sister suffered from mental illness, I couldn't help crying in class. Reluctant to accept the fact, I often said to myself 'God is just playing with me. It can't be true.' For this reason, I had struggled with these difficulties for a long time. During the fourth year of senior life, I almost buried myself in great grief. As a result, I had no appetite for study any more, and I even gave up. Consequently, I failed, once more.     Looking back to the most difficult time, from 2006 to 2007, when I had no interests and low spirits every day, I often think how silly l was then. Happily, my elder sister is getting better and better under the considerate care of my family. Apart from this, thanks to my friends, l am trying to recover quickly. Gradually, I am adjusting to life in college and get along well with new dorm-mates.      Everyone who hears my story would feel sorry for my experience. I need no sympathy but I would rather have more care and encouragement. I am convinced that life will be different and meaningful if I make every effort to take challenges and meet them.

Hungry Harvest is a business which collects and sells fruits and vegetables that most food companies will throw away. Everything doesn't grow the same way on a farm. But all that is too big or too small gets thrown out. That is why everything in a grocery store looks similar. Hungry Harvest will box those imperfect ones and deliver them to customers once a week.

Mr King said there were no rooms ready because of the meeting. The men were unhappy. Mr King wanted to help them. He remembered that Room 418, a very small room, was empty. He asked them if they would share a room. The three men said they would. Mr King said the room would be thirty dollars: ten for each one. Each man gave him the money and then went up to the room. Mr King soon began to feel sorry. \"Thirty dollars is a lot to ask as price for that small room. \" he thought. He called his assistant over and said, \"Here is five dollars. Take it to the men in Room 418. I asked too much for their room.\" The assistant took the money. While he was on the way there, he started to think, \"How can three men divide five dollars? I'll give them each only one dollar and keep the two dollars for myself. The men will be happy to get something back, and Mr King will never know. \" So the assistant returned one dollar to each man. Each man had at first paid ten dollars. After the assistant returned them one dollar each, each had paid nine. There were three men, $ 9 x3 = $ 27. The assistant kept $ 2. $ 27 + $ 2 = $ 29.

Your breath is short and your heart is pumping. Your legs feel like they couldn't carry you any faster.     And then you hear the groan of a zombie over your right shoulder. You must run or be eaten.     The zombie apocalypse  isn't upon you. You're just taking part in the latest fitness craze--Smartphone apps that make a fun and interactive game out of your daily workout.     Software developers are taking advantage of Smartphone's advanced technology--GPS, accelerometers  , MP3 players--to create \"immersive\" fitness games that appeal to both desperate and reluctant exercises.     It's part of an overall trend in the fitness industry toward making your daily workout \"a fun experience rather than something you have to do,\" said Jessica Matthews, an exercise physiologist for the American Council on Exercise. \"We are attempting more \"play\" opportunities as opposed to working out, basically getting people to move and having fun while they are doing it,\" Matthews said. One popular fitness game app, Zombies, Run!, places you in the role of a supplies runner for a walled community trying to survive against the walking dead.     During your run, the game's surprising complex story unfolds through your headphones. You \"pick up\" supplies for the community as you jog along. At certain intervals, you're warned that zombies are nearby, and if you don't pick up the pace, you'll have to pitch  some supplies to keep from being caught.     The game doesn't end once your jog is over. After your workout, you can use the supplies you picked up during your running to fortify your community. The GPS statistics from your run are uploaded automatically to the game's website, so you can review your average speed and the estimated calories you burned.     Teemo, Nexercise and Fitocracy all allow you to post your latest workout to share with friends. Some games have you work with friends to reach a common goal--completing a relay race, for example--while others encourage competition.     \"That's another big area, having that social component,\" Matthews said, \"Having social support of some kind is a critical factor in adhering to an exercise program.

Branwell's father and sisters saved their pennies to pack him off to London's Royal Academy of Arts, but if art was his calling, he dialed a wrong number. Within weeks he hightailed it home, a penniless failure. Hopes still high, the family landed Branwell a job as a private tutor, hoping this would free him to develop his literary skills and achieve the success and fame that he deserved. Failure again.  Still, the selfless sisters squelched their own goals, farming themselves out as teachers and governesses in support of their increasingly indebted brother, convinced the world must eventually recognize his genius. As failure multiplied, Branwell turned to alcohol, then opium, and eventually died as he had lived: a failure. So died hope in the one male -- but what of the three sisters? During Branwell's last years, the girls published a book of poetry at their own expense (under a pen name, for fear of reviewers' bias against females). Even Branwell might have laughed: they sold only two copies. They didn't give up. Instead, they continued in their spare time, late at night by candlelight, to pour out their contained emotion, writing of what they knew best, of women in conflict with their natural desires and social condition, in reality, less fiction than autobiography! And 19th century literature was transformed by Anne's Agnes Grey, Emily's Wuthering Heights, and Charlotte's Jane Eyre. But years of sacrifice for Branwell had eventually ruined their health. Emily took ill at her brother's funeral and died within 3 months, aged 29; Anne died 5 months later, aged 30; Charlotte lived only to age 39. If only they had been nurtured instead of sacrificed. No one remembers Branwell's name, much less of his art or literature, but the Bronte sisters' tragically short lives teach us even more of life than literature.

Our everyday speech is made up in large part of words like probably, many, soon, great, little. What do these words mean?Such verbal expression is not necessarily to be criticized. Indeed, it has a value just because it allows us to express judgments when a precise quantitative statement is out of the question. We have been trying to pin down by experiments what people mean by these expressions in specific contexts, and how the meanings change with age. For instance, a subject is told \"There are many trees in the park\" and is asked to say what number the word many mean to him. Or a child is invited to take \"some\" sweets from a bowl and we then count how many he has taken. We compare the number he takes when he is alone with the number when one or more other children are present and are to take some sweets after him, or with the number he takes when told to give \"some\" sweets to another child. First, we find that the number depends, of course, on the items involved. To most people some friends means about five, while some trees means about twenty. However, unrelated areas sometimes show parallel values. For instance, the language of probability seems to mean about the same thing in predictions about the weather and about politics: the expression \"is certain to\" (rain, or be elected) signifies to the average person about a 70 percent chance; \"is likely to\", about a 60 percent chance; \"probably will\" about 55 percent. Secondly, the size of the population of items influences the value assigned to an expression. Thus, if we tell a subject to take \"a few\" or \" a lot of\" glass balls from a box, he will take more if the box contains a large number of glass balls than if it has a small number. But not proportionately more: if we increase the number of glass balls eight times, the subject takes only half as large a percentage of the total. Thirdly, there is a marked change with age. Among children between six and fourteen years old, the older the child, the fewer glass balls he will take. But the difference between a lot and a few widens with age.

First, we find that the number depends, of course, on the items involved. To most people some friends means about five, while some trees means about twenty. However, unrelated areas sometimes show parallel values. For instance, the language of probability seems to mean about the same thing in predictions about the weather and about politics: the expression \"is certain to\" (rain, or be elected) signifies to the average person about a 70 percent chance; \"is likely to\", about a 60 percent chance; \"probably will\" about 55 percent. Secondly, the size of the population of items influences the value assigned to an expression. Thus, if we tell a subject to take \"a few\" or \" a lot of\" glass balls from a box, he will take more if the box contains a large number of glass balls than if it has a small number. But not proportionately more: if we increase the number of glass balls eight times, the subject takes only half as large a percentage of the total. Thirdly, there is a marked change with age. Among children between six and fourteen years old, the older the child, the fewer glass balls he will take. But the difference between a lot and a few widens with age. This age effect is so consistent that it might be used as a test of intelligence. What will tell us about the intelligence of a child?", "subject": ""}

I would like to thank you all for coming on this very special day for every student on this stage. I know how proud you must be. As we have grown over the years, there are many steps and stages we all have gone through. From learning our shapes and color1s, to getting our first kiss in middle school, or how about explaining to our parents why we skipped school because the headmaster called home. As we remember these days, things that we've done will be with us forever. But this is only the start of our journey. To graduate is one more step we've taken in our lives. Now I would like to take the time to thank everyone who has helped me get this far. First of all, thank you to all the teachers. None of us would be here without you always pushing our studying abilities to the fullest.

In 2010, more than 200 million people left their home countries to live in a new country. This is about 3 percent of the total world population. Some experts believe that number will swell to 400 million by 2050. Rates of immigration have remained strong for the last 300 years, but patterns of immigration have changed since World War II. The backgrounds and experiences of today's immigrants are different from those of the typical European immigrant of the nineteenth and early twentieth centuries. Contemporary immigrants range from unskilled laborers to highly skilled professionals, and they come from and go to countries all over the world. In the nineteenth century and until World War II, immigration was primarily in one direction- from the Old World to the New World. This is no longer the case. Countries such as Russia and China, which have long been, and continue to be, significant source countries, are now also destination countries. There is also considerable mobility inside regions, such as from one European country to another, or among the countries of the former Soviet Union. In spite of such differences, the push and pull factors for immigration remain essentially the same as they were 100 years ago. Most people move to another country because they want a better life. For the majority of immigrants, this means better economic conditions. As in past generations, a labor shortage in one country often draws workers from another country, especially if wages are significantly higher. In some small countries, for example, Qatar, United Arab Emirates, and Kuwait, there are more jobs than citizens. The demand for labor is so high that the majority of the population consists of foreign-born workers, ranging from highly skilled engineers and financial experts to domestic and construction workers. In traditional destination countries, such as the United States, however, labor needs have changed. Today, although there is still demand for unskilled labor, there is increasing demand for people with a high level of skill and education. The need for less skilled labor has shifted to other countries. As work on farms and in industry in the United States and Canada once drew workers from all over the world, now work in factories in Taiwan and south Korea attracts workers from Vietnam, the Philippines, and Cambodia. Most global immigration is legal: however, a large number of people also move across national borders illegally in pursuit of employment. Experts estimate that about 15 to 20 percent of immigrants worldwide are in their new countries illegally. The United States has the largest number of these immigrants, followed by South Africa, with significant numbers also in Northern and Western Europe and Mexico. These immigrants face particular challenges because they often must hide from the authorities who might deport them back to their home countries. Their illegal status also means that employers may take advantage of them by forcing them to work longer hours and paying them less than the legal minimum wage. Although economics remains the most important motivation in all forms of immigrant, other factors are also important. Some people decide to leave their home countries because their actions or political beliefs make it dangerous for them to remain. Others choose to leave because their home country has become too dangerous and unstable, often because of war or political unrest. They wish to find a place that is secure for themselves and their families. Education is also a significant factor for many modern immigrants. They want to raise their children in a place where they can get a good education, which, in turn, they hope will provide them with better prospects for the future. Finally, family and community ties also play a role in immigration decisions. As in the past, once a group of people from one country establishes a community in a new country, more people from that country is likely to follow. The pattern, direction, and rate of immigration may change as the global economy changes.

In traditional destination countries, such as the United States, however, labor needs have changed. Today, although there is still demand for unskilled labor, there is increasing demand for people with a high level of skill and education. The need for less skilled labor has shifted to other countries. As work on farms and in industry in the United States and Canada once drew workers from all over the world, now work in factories in Taiwan and south Korea attracts workers from Vietnam, the Philippines, and Cambodia. Most global immigration is legal: however, a large number of people also move across national borders illegally in pursuit of employment. Experts estimate that about 15 to 20 percent of immigrants worldwide are in their new countries illegally. The United States has the largest number of these immigrants, followed by South Africa, with significant numbers also in Northern and Western Europe and Mexico. These immigrants face particular challenges because they often must hide from the authorities who might deport them back to their home countries. Their illegal status also means that employers may take advantage of them by forcing them to work longer hours and paying them less than the legal minimum wage. Although economics remains the most important motivation in all forms of immigrant, other factors are also important. Some people decide to leave their home countries because their actions or political beliefs make it dangerous for them to remain. Others choose to leave because their home country has become too dangerous and unstable, often because of war or political unrest. They wish to find a place that is secure for themselves and their families. Education is also a significant factor for many modern immigrants. They want to raise their children in a place where they can get a good education, which, in turn, they hope will provide them with better prospects for the future. Finally, family and community ties also play a role in immigration decisions. As in the past, once a group of people from one country establishes a community in a new country, more people from that country is likely to follow. The pattern, direction, and rate of immigration may change as the global economy changes. However, as long as life in a new country is more attractive than life in the old country, immigration will continue. Why do some employers sometimes pay illegal immigrants less than the legal minimum wage?", "subject": ""}
{"answer": 2, "choices": ["Education", "Political instability", "Religious freedom", "Family and community connections"], "question": "The world's population is more mobile  today than ever before. In 2010, more than 200 million people left their home countries to live in a new country. This is about 3 percent of the total world population. Some experts believe that number will swell to 400 million by 2050. Rates of immigration have remained strong for the last 300 years, but patterns of immigration have changed since World War II. The backgrounds and experiences of today's immigrants are different from those of the typical European immigrant of the nineteenth and early twentieth centuries. Contemporary immigrants range from unskilled laborers to highly skilled professionals, and they come from and go to countries all over the world. In the nineteenth century and until World War II, immigration was primarily in one direction- from the Old World to the New World. This is no longer the case. Countries such as Russia and China, which have long been, and continue to be, significant source countries, are now also destination countries. There is also considerable mobility inside regions, such as from one European country to another, or among the countries of the former Soviet Union. In spite of such differences, the push and pull factors for immigration remain essentially the same as they were 100 years ago. Most people move to another country because they want a better life. For the majority of immigrants, this means better economic conditions. As in past generations, a labor shortage in one country often draws workers from another country, especially if wages are significantly higher. In some small countries, for example, Qatar, United Arab Emirates, and Kuwait, there are more jobs than citizens.

It is so embarrassing when they forget to take a handkerchief or tissue along with them. Want to stay away from colds? Put on a happy face.

In this study, Cohen has interviewed 193 adults every day for two weeks. During the interviews, the people told researchers that they were given colds by doctors and had to stay alone in a room for six days. The results showed that everyone in the study was equally  likely to get ill. But for people who said they felt happy during the research period, their illness are less serious and lasted for a shorter time.

Knowing if someone is lying can be useful. There are a number of behaviors that you can observe to help catch someone in a lie. Eyes, windows to the soul, can provide information about whether you are hearing the truth or a lie. Here is a simple experiment. Ask a friend or a family member to imagine their mother with green hair. You should notice that their eyes look up to their left while they are imagining their mother. Then ask them to think about what they did this morning and their eyes will probably look up to the right. Basically, eye movement to the left indicates the person is imagining something that is not real or did not happen. When the eyes move up and to the right, the person is remembering something that actually happened. Body language is another way to see if someone is telling tales.

It seems that when we are being less than truthful our hands want to cover our face in some way. It is unlikely that a liar (someone who tells lies) will touch their chest with an open hand.

They have discovered that the arrangement  of taste buds  on the tongue varies for different body types. The scientist team examined 1,000 British adults and divided them into three physiologically  recognized body types--ectomorphs, endomorphs mesomorphs. They determined that a person's body type indicated  where they were likely to have the most taste buds - on the sweet, bitter or salty areas of their tongues.  The study showed that ectomorphs, who make up one in three of the population, usually have a small delicate shape, have a sweet tooth but hate bitter foods. Mesomorphs, who make up 20percent of the population, usually have a muscular shape and prefer salty and bitter foods but dislike sweet foods. Half the British population are endomorphs with soft, rounded bodies, and they like most foods. The findings showed that for two in three people food preference was a physiological rather than a psychological choice.   Body shape expert Simon Bradshaw, who takes change of his team, said, \"It appears that simply by looking at a person's body shape we can make sure about their taste preferences.\" But Catherine Collins, of the British Dietetic Association said, \"It is difficult to tell whether our body shape dictates the food we like, or the food we like dictates body shape. _ people who prefer most types of foods will be fatter and people who are the endomorph shape tend to  find it more difficult to lose weight.\" Which of the following is TRUE according to the passage?", "subject": ""}

They determined that a person's body type indicated  where they were likely to have the most taste buds - on the sweet, bitter or salty areas of their tongues.  The study showed that ectomorphs, who make up one in three of the population, usually have a small delicate shape, have a sweet tooth but hate bitter foods. Mesomorphs, who make up 20percent of the population, usually have a muscular shape and prefer salty and bitter foods but dislike sweet foods. Half the British population are endomorphs with soft, rounded bodies, and they like most foods.
