But experts are now warning that the current shoe fashions will be causing teenagers discomfort in the short term and storing up years of foot, knee and back pain in the future. Here, the experts identify the problems caused by teenagers' shoe choice. KEDS/VANS Slip-on shoes with elastic sides are particularly popular among teenage boys-with Keds and Vans the most sought-after brands. The main problem is that they are just too flat--so flat that the heel, which strikes the ground first, also becomes damaged and painful. BALLET PUMPS The worst shoes of all are such light and thin dolly shoes. The problem is partly their flatness, as with Keds and Vans. However ballet pumps, which have no string or heel, have other specific problems. \"As the shoe has no fastening device, it relies on the toes to keep the shoe on, causing an awkward gait ,this leads to short-and long-term problems such as calluses ,heel and knee pain.\" WEDGES AND STILETTOS      These shoes can also cause problems with gait, They may look good, but the heels on these are so high they can force the wearer's body weight forward, making them very unstable. Teens who wear these shoes regularly are also in danger of joining those millions of women with constant back pain. SCHOOL SHOES      So what do podiatrists have on their wish list, especially for everyday wear? Something in a natural, breathable fabric, with a string to hold it on, with a small heel and a deep toe-box that does not press the toes, such as Clark's, Marks & Spencer or Rhino. If your teen insists on wearing 'bad' shoes, get them some simple foot orthotics in the shoes.

{"answer": 1, "choices": ["Placebo.", "Oxytocin.", "The gesture.", "The social status."], "question": "Women are friendly. But men are more competitive. Why? Researchers have found it's all down to the hormone oxytocin . Although known as the love hormone, it affects the sexes differently. \"Women tend to be social in their behavior. They often share with others. But men tend to be competitive. They are trying to improve their social status,\" said Professor Ryan. Generally, people believe that the hormone exytocin is let out in our body in various social situations and our body creates a large amount of it during positive social interaction such as falling in love or giving birth. But in a previous experiment Professor Ryan found that the hormone is also let out in our body during negative social interactions such as envy. Further researches showed that in men the hormone oxytocin improves the ability to recognize competitive relationships, but in women it raises the ability to recognize friendship. Professor Ryan's recent experiment used 62 men and women aged 20 to 37. Half of the participants received oxytocin. The other half received placebo .

Following each treatment, they were shown some video pictures with different social interactions. Then they were asked to analyze the relationships by answering some questions. The questions were about telling friendship from competition. And their answers should be based on gestures, body language and facial expressions. The results indicated that, after treatment with oxytocin, men's ability to correctly recognize competitive relationships improved, but in women it was the ability to correctly recognize friendship that got better.

The country's huge young population have quickly taken to the coffee culture. Coffee stores have spread from major cities like New Delhi and Mumbai to smaller towns. Coffee use has doubled in the last ten years . It is the success of this market that has gained the attention of companies like the American-based coffee chain Starbucks. The company will open its first store in India later this year. Other companies like Lavazza and Costa Coffee are already there. Yet, the growth of coffee will not reduce the popularity of tea. Indians drink eight times more tea than coffee. They have been drinking tea for more than one hundred and fifty years. India is one of the world's biggest producers of tea, which is known locally as \"chai\". Outside homes and offices, it is mostly sold by small businesses on the street.

Thanks to modern technology, we have been able to increase greatly the efficiency of our work force. New machines and new methods have helped cut down time and expense while increasing overall output. This has meant more production and a higher standard of living. For most of us in America, modern technology is thought of as the reason why we can have cars and television sets. However, technology has also increased the amount of food available to us, by means of modern farming machinery and animal breeding techniques, and has extended our life span via  medical technology. Will mankind continue to live longer and have a higher quality of life? In large measure the answer depends on technology and our ability to use it widely. If we keep making progress as we have over the past fifty years, the answer is definitely yes. The advancement of technology depends upon research and development, and the latest statistics  show that the United States is continuing to pump billions of dollars annually  into such efforts. So while we are running out of some scarce resources  we may well find technological substitutes for many of them through our research programs. Therefore, in the final analysis the three major factors of production(land, labor and capital) are all influenced by technology.

However, others have interpreted this trend as a reaction to longer working hours and the break up of more marriages. The boarding schools of fiction are presented as one long midnight feast with pillow fights making firm friendships. However, some people say the reality is children having more homesickness and a lack of individual attention. Modern boarding schools have done much to get rid of the image of the mass dormitories with 40 or more beds in one room, some going as far as providing private rooms with bathrooms. Similarly, they make great announcements for their academic advantage, particularly in light of the increase in exams, homework and university entrance requirements facing children wishing to succeed in the modern world. Alongside these more conventional schools, two types of boarding schools have also become more popular recently. Sports academies and stage schools seek to cater for children with particular interests and talents, while so-called troubled-teens have been able to turn to a range of religious or wilderness schools to solve their problematic behavior. Boarding schools allow children a safe space in which to accomplish greater control and independence over their daily lives. Teachers and staff can look after and support but they are unlikely to be over-protective. This can be a great preparation for university or for working away from home in later life as it provides an intermediate step between childhood and full independence. However, parents are a child's most natural support and best role models to learn from. If they are separated from them for long periods of time, this may damage their relationship and leave the child feeling anxious or alone. Schools are unlikely to be able to copy the detailed knowledge of each individual child that a parent has and therefore cannot be as effective in supporting the child.

The authors says that the young now refuse to admire anyone and that we are living in a world too well informed, too curious showing us the faults of the public figures who could become today's stars, until we lose faith and start looking for defects in any person who seems worthy of respect.  Is it true that we know too much? Were our ancestors lucky to be only partly informed? Those who read the first biographies of George Washington, Joan of Arc, or other great men and women of the past were not told that their hero had bad breath or disliked his mother; they only found a description of his great accomplishments and their admiration was strengthened. In fact, early biographers didn't hesitate to make up an admirable story or two about their hero. The man who wrote the first biography of Washington, for instance, invented the cherry tree; he admitted later that there was no truth in it, but he said that it would give young men a good example to follow. His readers didn't seem to object; the book was reprinted eighty times--a great success in those days. Modern biographers do not invent such stories; they respect the facts, as indeed they should. But we pay a price for their truthfulness, for in their efforts to show \"the whole person,\" they tell us more than we really need to know about private lives, family secrets, and human weakness. The true greatness of a fine man is often forgotten in the display; and people lose not only their admiration for him, but their willingness to trust any other \"star\" completely. It may be difficult to be a hero in the world these days, under the searching eyes of the society. But surely excellence has not disappeared completely; there are still individuals who are superior to their fellow men by their wisdom, their courage, or their character.

His readers didn't seem to object; the book was reprinted eighty times--a great success in those days. Modern biographers do not invent such stories; they respect the facts, as indeed they should. But we pay a price for their truthfulness, for in their efforts to show \"the whole person,\" they tell us more than we really need to know about private lives, family secrets, and human weakness. The true greatness of a fine man is often forgotten in the display; and people lose not only their admiration for him, but their willingness to trust any other \"star\" completely. It may be difficult to be a hero in the world these days, under the searching eyes of the society. But surely excellence has not disappeared completely; there are still individuals who are superior to their fellow men by their wisdom, their courage, or their character. They can be heroes if people are willing to ignore their human imperfection and to admit the respect that their admirable qualities inspire. Heroes are needed everywhere, at any time. It's a sad sky that has no shining stars. What is essential in solving the problem mentioned in the passage?", "subject": ""}

Scientists know that climate change has a major effect on the Arctic Ocean partly because sea ice is disappearing. They also know that areas of open seawater are expanding. Such areas are known to take in sunlight and increase temperatures. Scientists say this has helped to cause the loss of the Arctic's ice cover. For the study, the American scientists compared eighteen computer programs with observations made by satellites and other instruments. The Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change used the computer programs to prepare its 2007 estimates of climate change. The computer programs gave estimates of the amount of ice in the Arctic Ocean in the month of September. September is when the Arctic has the least ice, after the warm, summer months. The computer estimates suggested an ice loss of two and a half percent for every ten-year period between 1953 and 2006. Newer studies of the Arctic have used information gathered by aircraft, satellites and ships. This information showed a loss of September ice cover of almost eight percent for every ten-year period between 1953 and last year.

Thousands of years ago, people killed the wild horses that lived around them for food. Over time, people began to catch the animals and raise them. This was the first step in domestication. As people began to tame and ride horses, they chose to keep those animals that had more desirable characteristics. For example, people may have chosen to keep horses that had a gentle personality so they could be ridden more easily.

Chinese smokers now become addicted to nicotine at the age of 19, five years earlier than the average starting age of 24 in 1997,\" a report said a couple of years ago. Of the 1.1 billion smokers all over the world. more than 800 million are in developing countries. And as the world's largest developing country, China also has the largest number of smokers. Some frightening facts start to appear when we examine who China's smokers are. Of the 350 million addicts, more than 100 million are under the age of 18, while more than 50 percent of male teachers and doctors are smokers. Such a high rate of addicts among male teachers and doctors will certainly have a bad impact on the young generation. Teachers are usually expected to be role models for students who tend to consider whatever they do is right and follow their example. It is very likely that the number of teenage smokers will increase in the near future unless measures are taken to forbid teachers from smoking in front of their students or designate schools as no-smoking zones. What is truly puzzling is why so many doctors smoke. They are aware of the results of the habit, such as high blood pressure and lung cancer. Their example only helps justify the addiction of so many others. If educated people set an example by stopping smoking at least in public places. it would be much easier to drive home the notion that it is uncivilized to smoke in public places. In China, there should also be a national law to ban smoking in public places.

I've never watched her show, but when a self-made billionaire gives life advice it's probably worth listening to. Her point is that blind luck is very rare. You may have to be lucky to find a good job these days but that does not mean you should sit at home waiting for the opportunity to come to you. If you're a Chinese, you may already be familiar with the tale of a farmer waiting by a tree stump  for a rabbit to run out and break its neck. A book by the UK psychologist Richard Wiseman, called The Luck Factor, argues we can all make ourselves luckier. It's not about going to a temple to burn some incense  hopes that the gods will give you good fortune; it's practical advice you can follow each day. Wiseman conducted an experiment as part of his studies. First he divided volunteers into two groups; those who said they were lucky in life and those who said they were not. He gave everyone a newspaper and asked them to look through it to count how many photographs it had inside. On average, the unlucky people took about two minutes to count the photographs while the lucky people took just seconds. Why? On the second page of the newspaper, a command, \"Stop counting. There are 43 photographs in this newspaper,\" was written in big letters. The unlucky people mostly did not spot the message. It's easy to compare this situation to a young person looking for jobs in a local paper. They might search so hard for one type of position that they miss an even better opportunity. People who are \"lucky\", in fact, keep an open mind and don't go through the same routine every day. I first came to China in 2002 when it was considered a rather strange thing to do. Like many foreigners, my plan was to teach English for one year. Seven years later, and still here, I've had many great opportunities such as writing for newspapers and magazines. I did not dream these would have been possible. I've also never been sick, had an accident, got into a fight or had problems with the police. Coincidence? After reading about Professor Wiseman's studies I think not. As Wiseman advises, I usually trust my own judgment. Your friends and parents may give you advice based on rational thinking, but it's important to consider how you feel about each choice you make. Your feeling acts as a warning for a potential problem. Finally, try to turn bad luck into good. Even if you do fall down and break a leg, the time spent at home can be used wisely to study English.

It is held on the 15th day of the 8th lunar month. Vietnamese families plan their activities around their children on this special day. In a Vietnamese folk story, parents were working so hard to prepare for the harvest that they left the children playing by themselves. To make up for that time, the parents would use the Mid-Autumn Festival as a chance to show their love and thanks for their children. As a result, the Mid-Autumn Festival is also called the Children's Festival. In the United States, this tradition continues in many Vietnamese-American families. Activities are often centered on children and education. Parents buy lanterns for their children so that they can take part in a candle and lantern parade at dawn. Lanterns mean brightness, while the parade means success in school. Vietnamese markets sell a variety of lanterns, but the most popular children's lantern is the star lantern. Other children's activities include arts and crafts in which children make face masks and lanterns. Children also perform traditional Vietnamese dances for adults and take part in contests for prizes. Unicorn   dancers are also very popular. Like Chinese people, Vietnamese parents tell their children folk stories and serve moon cakes and other special treats under the bright moon. A favorite folk story is about a carp   that wanted to become a dragon. The carp worked and worked and finally changed itself into a dragon.

If we continue to burn oil and pump carbon into the atmosphere, then the effects on global climate will lead to global disasters even before the oil disappear. The British government has set a target of a 20 percent reduction in carbon emission by 2010. Central to this policy is the search for alternative, renewable forms of energy production---and this is where the serious disagreement among scientists begins. Here, two people active in the debate about wind farms give their points of view. Simon Shearman \"First, a few facts about wind power.

Eleven artists used the small, ordinary objects to create sculptures, portraits and wearable art. Some of the works are political, some are personal and others are just fun. Wright said each artist reimagines and repurposes the buttons to make art. \"What I tried to do with this show,\" he said , \"was to look at artists who were promoting that level of craft.\" He said he wanted the button art to be comparable to a painting \"because of the amount of detail and precision in the work\". Artist Beau McCall produced \"A Harlem Hangover\". It looks like a wine bottle that fell over on a table. A stream of connected red buttons hang over the side, like wine flowing down. Similar red buttons form a small pool on the floor. McCall layers buttons of different shapes and sizes to create the bottle. The stitching that holds them together is also part of the artistic design. For San Francisco-based artist Lisa Kokin, buttons are highly personal.

Recently another boy told Bill that he should \"go Ajax\" his teeth. Bill was crushed. Had the other boy been thinking, he would have realized that there is a better way to handle such a situation. He could have dealt with it with tact. He could have showed this hurtful truth in a more careful, sensitive way--that's \"tact\". If a person isn't sensitive to another's feelings, there is no way he or she can be tactful. Yesterday, my 5-year-old brother proudly announced that he had cleaned the screen on our television set. Unfortunately, he used furniture polish , which produced an oily film on the television screen. My mother smiled and thanked him for his efforts--and then showed how to clean the screen properly. Her sensitivity enables my brother to keep his self-respect. Yet, sensitivity alone does not make tact. \"Tactfulness\" also requires \"truthfulness\". Doctors, for example must be truthful. If a patient has just been disabled in an accident, a tactful doctor will tell the truth--but express it with sensitivity. The doctor may try to give the patient hope by telling them curing techniques under study or about advanced equipment now available. Doctors must use tact with patients relatives as well. Instead of bluntly saying, \"Your husband is disabled,\" a doctor might say, \"I'm sorry, but your husband has lost feeling in his legs and...\" Tact should not be confused with trickery.

He has been disabled since, but the Californian boy never gave up on the goal of walking. He recently took his first steps. When Ivison first met Ricochet, the two immediately hit it off.

The Spanish explorer Ponce de Leon was convinced that he would find the Foundation of Youth in what is now the state of Florida. According to the Bible, Methuselah lived to be more than 900 years old. The subject of longevity is fascinating, and scientists study individuals such as Jeanne Calment to learn about the aging process. Calment died in 1997 in Arles, France, at the age of 122. She never married, and she lived in her own apartment until moving to a retirement community when she was 109. Most scientists agree that bodies will last, at best, about 125 years.

Recent improvements in medicine and the environment have extended life expectancy, especially for those from poorer parts of the world. It is not clear, however, whether such improvements will lengthen life expectancy beyond a certain point. Life expectancy is the number of years an infant can be expected to live, given the conditions into which it is born. Life expectancy, therefore, is affected by nutrition, medical care, and social and political circumstances. An individual's genetic makeup is also an important factor. Children from long-lived families can hope to enjoy long lives themselves. According to recent data, the average life expectancy worldwide in 1998 was 67 years. This can be compared with an average life expectancy of 77 in the United States. In 1970 the average life expectancy worldwide was 61 years, or 6 years less than it was in 1998. This same period saw a drop in infant mortality --- the death of a child before the first birthday---from 80 births out of 1,000 to 54 births out of 1,000. According to some researchers, the rise in the average life expectancy is due primarily to the drop in infant mortality. It is not so much that adults are living to an older age.

It's been amazing. Therefore, if you're sick and tired of being sick and tired, it's time you make a change, too. The definition of insanity   is doing the same thing over and over and expecting different results. I know you aren't stupid. If you continue to do what everyone else is doing: trading time for money, you're going to keep getting what everyone else is getting: being broke and not having the time to do what is really important to you. Do your due diligence. Find a home-based business that works well for you. Go to work, and live the life you've always imagined!

Mike is only three months younger than Zac Sunderland, the 17-year-old American boy who had taken the crown as the youngest solo around-the-world sailor in July. The two youngsters met in Cape Town in South Africa as they crossed the globe in different directions.

Father and son sailed separate boats across the Atlantic when Mike was 14, making him the youngest person to cross that ocean solo. That record gave him the taste for this even greater challenge. On the recent journey, the scariest moment for Mike came when his sailboat was hit by storms in the southern Indian Ocean. \"We were picked up by what felt like a 60-foot wave and threw down on our side at 90 degrees,\" he said. \"It felt like I was going right over.

{"answer": 3, "choices": ["How to promote sleep.", "How kids learn from their parents.", "The advantages of going to bed early.", "The disadvantages of phone usage before bed."], "question": "Experts recently suggested that teens should start adopting early bedtimes. Before you dismiss it as a habit suited only for young kids, consider that there are serious advantages in being well-rested. And now, even more research suggests that putting phones away before going to sleep is important to teens' well-being. A new study from Seton Hall University School of Health and Medicine Science found that 62 percent of kids used their smart phones before bed, and it's causing less sleep and poor performance in school. Those teens who text  before bedtime tend to go to sleep later, and get up later in the morning. Such behavior can be associated with mental health issues like depression or anxiety. Besides, once teens do receive a text, experts found, they tend to respond right away. Then the text conversation continues -- resulting in an even later bedtime. The study's co-author Dr. Peter Polos says this leads to excessive stimulation  at night. Light from electronic devices can block the secretion  of melatonin -- a hormone  that promotes sleep, which makes sleep difficult in the face of overuse of smart phones at night. It's true! More screen time means less sleep time; other studies have suggested the same idea. As for a final piece of advice, Dr. Sushanth Bhat says, since getting the proper amount of sleep is very important for brain development and learning in the teenage years, our study should encourage parents and guardians   to limit adolescent smart phone usage at night.

A report released by the US National Marriage Project found \"a rather weakening of the institution of marriage\" in America. The researchers said the prefix = st1 /USmarriage rate has never been lower, births to unmarried women have skyrocketed, the divorce rate remains high and Americans' marriages are less happy than in the past. \"There is no known society that has got along without marriage and has done a decent job in rearing and sponsoring the next generation,\" said Barbara Dafoe Whitehead, US National Marriage Project co-director. The crumbling of the institution of marriage should not be viewed as a kind social trend with no costs to society at large, added the project's other co-director, David Popenoe. US government statistics cited in the Rutgers report detail a crisis in marriage whose origins can be traced back about 40 years. The report, citing census data ,said the marriage rate has quickly reduced by a third since 1960. It said there were about 73 marriages per 1,000 unmarried women aged 15 and up in 1960. In 1996, the last year for which such figures were available, the rate was about 49 per 1,000. Popenoe said the USmarriage rate now has dropped below a previous historic low recorded at the turn of the century. He said several factors have something to do with the trend. One is that Americans are delaying marriage until they are older. In 1960, the median age for first marriages was 20 for women and 23 for men. In 1997, with many college-educated Americans delaying marriage until their 30s, the median age rose to 25 for women and 27 for men, the report said. \"The later the marriage, by and large, the lower the (overall) marriage rate in the long run. In other words, people delay too long and then they decide not to marry after a while,\" Popenoe said. In addition, many American women, particularly black women, are giving birth and raising children without getting married. In 1960,5.3 percent of all USbabies were born to unwed mothers, according to government statistics. In 1997,32 percent of all babies were born to unmarried women-and a startling 69 percent of black babies had unwed mothers. The percentage of USchildren living without their father present also has ballooned. In 1960, nine percent of children lived in a single-parent household. Last year, 28 percent of all children and 55 percent of all black children lived with a single parent. Children in single-parent households overwhelmingly live with their mothers, with fathers absent. Which of the following is the best title for the passage?", "subject": ""}

But rest assured, Coming Home will draw you in with its emotionally charged story of love, joy and sorrow. The movie follows a devoted couple, Lu Yanshi (Chen Daoming) and Feng Wanyu (Gong Li), who are separated when Lu is arrested as a political prisoner. Released during the last days of the \"cultural revolution\" (1966-76), Lu finally returns home only to find that his beloved wife has amnesia and is unable to recognize him. As a stranger in his broken family, Lu decides to resurrect their past together and reawaken his wife's memory. Just like the story suggests, Coming Home is a tearjerker. But different from those movies that make the audience cry by being evocative , such as Feng Xiaogang's Aftershock or Pixar's Toy Story 3, director Zhang's idea of moving the audience is quite special, and makes the most of his delicate skills. In Coming Home, Zhang deals with a dramatic story in such a quiet way that the audience's emotions are drawn out little by little by the main characters, as they struggle in pain while their heroic inner strength shines. So, when you cry -- and very likely you will -- you will understand why: Because you wish a future happiness for the characters, and maybe because you can imagine the story having happened to your grandparents. Another impressive aspect is how Zhang uses \"amnesia\", a narrative technique that's more common in romantic comedies. For that, he has Gong Li to thank the most. Gong, one of Zhang's longtime collaborators, knows exactly what the director wants. With a limited number of lines throughout the film, Gong is fully committed to her character and touches the audience with great facial expressions and subtle changes of emotion.

Another impressive aspect is how Zhang uses \"amnesia\", a narrative technique that's more common in romantic comedies. For that, he has Gong Li to thank the most. Gong, one of Zhang's longtime collaborators, knows exactly what the director wants. With a limited number of lines throughout the film, Gong is fully committed to her character and touches the audience with great facial expressions and subtle changes of emotion. Maybe now you understand why everyone can relate to the film. Although it reflects on a big era  through the story of a small family, the era is only a backdrop. What moves the young audience here is love, and you will leave the cinema with a new understanding of it. Tell us what you think about Zhang Yimou's new film Coming Home.

{"answer": 1, "choices": ["the director casts the actors that are popular with us all", "it interprets the theme of love that is shared by all", "the \"cultural revolution\" has left deep scars on us all", "everyone shows sympathy to a patient with amnesia"], "question": "When you see the trailer  for Coming Home, Zhang Yimou's latest project, you may not be attracted by it at first, due to the film's senior cast and historic setting. But rest assured, Coming Home will draw you in with its emotionally charged story of love, joy and sorrow. The movie follows a devoted couple, Lu Yanshi (Chen Daoming) and Feng Wanyu (Gong Li), who are separated when Lu is arrested as a political prisoner. Released during the last days of the \"cultural revolution\" (1966-76), Lu finally returns home only to find that his beloved wife has amnesia and is unable to recognize him. As a stranger in his broken family, Lu decides to resurrect their past together and reawaken his wife's memory. Just like the story suggests, Coming Home is a tearjerker. But different from those movies that make the audience cry by being evocative , such as Feng Xiaogang's Aftershock or Pixar's Toy Story 3, director Zhang's idea of moving the audience is quite special, and makes the most of his delicate skills. In Coming Home, Zhang deals with a dramatic story in such a quiet way that the audience's emotions are drawn out little by little by the main characters, as they struggle in pain while their heroic inner strength shines.

Feeling stressed changes how people weigh risk and reward. However, an article published in Current Directions in Psychological Science, a journal of the Association for Psychological Science, suggests stressed people pay more attention to the positive sides of a possible outcome. It's a bit surprising that stress makes people focus on the way things could go right, says Mara Mather of the University of Southern California. She co-wrote the review paper with Nichole R.Lighthall. \"This is sort of not what people would think, \" Mather says. \"Stress is usually associated with negative experiences, so you'd think, maybe I'm going to be more focused on the negative outcomes.\" But researchers have found that when people are under stress, they start paying more attention to positive information and discounting negative information. \"Stress seems to help people learn from positive feedback and impairs their learning from negative feedback, \" Mather says. When people under stress are making a difficult decision, they may pay more attention to the good sides of the alternatives they're considering and less to the problems. So someone who's deciding whether to take a new job and is feeling stressed by the decision might focus on the increase in salary more than the longer commute . The increased focus on the positives also helps explain why stress plays a role in addictions. People under stress have a harder time controlling their urges. \"The compulsion to get that reward comes stronger and they're less able to resist it,\" Mather says.

Memory is our ability to learn something, save it and recall it when needed. Our memories are important to our sense of self, our personalities, and our ability to understand the world. Scientists say that there are different types of memory. There is short-term memory and long-term memory. Your short-term memory saves information for a few seconds or a few minutes. For example, the time it takes to compare the prices of a few items in a store. Long-term memory involves the information you try hard to keep, because it's meaningful to you (an example is data  about family and friends. ) And then there is visual memory and sound memory. But these are not hard and fast: scientists argue a lot about the nature of memory. Scientists have also found that people memorize things in different ways.

The team asked their 600 volunteers about their income ,their daily costs, gifts for others and donations to charity. \"No matter how much money each person made, those who spent money on others could get greater happiness than those who spent money only on themselves,\" Dunn said. Dunn's team also surveyed 16 workers at a company in Boston after they received an award of between $3,000 and $8,000. \"Of course they felt happy after receiving the awards,\" they wrote in their report. \"But when they gave the people in need $5, they were happier.\" \"The findings showed that as little as $5 could be enough to produce happiness on a whole day,\" Dunn said.

But when the bell for the next class rings, you can't believe how quickly time has passed. If you have this experience, you'll know how time flies when you are having fun and _ when you are bored. Now scientists have come up with a reason why this happens. They have found that the brain changes its way to work according to how we direct our attention to a task. When we are bored, we pay more attention to how time is passing. And this makes our brains think the clock is ticking more slowly. Recently some researchers who want to understand the conditions carried out an experiment. In the experiment, twelve volunteers watched a picture while researchers monitored their brain activity. The volunteers were told to first notice how long a picture appeared, then the color of the picture, and thirdly, study the both. The results showed that the brain was more active when the volunteers paid attention to more subjects. It is thought that if the brain is busy noticing many aspects of a task, it has to spread its resources, and pays less attention to the clock. Therefore, time seems to go quickly.

I can't remember right now. \" Have you ever heard your grandparents ask questions like this sometimes? Usually, we think that older people's memory becomes bad because their brains get weak. But now a team of scientists at the University of Tubingen in Germany has a new idea.[ \"The human brain works slower in old age,\" says Michael Ramscar, the lead scientist. \"But only because they have stored more information overtime. \" The findings are based on a series of computer simulations of learning and memory. Scientists let the computers read a certain amount of words and learn new things each day. When the computer \"reads\" only so much, its performance on cognitive tests is similar of a young adult. But if the computer learns the experiences we might encounter over a lifetime, its performance is similar to that of an older adult. Often it is slower, but not because its processing capacity has declined. Rather, increased \"experience\" has caused the computer's database to grow, giving it more data to process-which takes time.

If everyone has a car and drives anywhere they want to go, there will be serious traffic problems on the road. Luckily, trains are a good form of public transport. British people use trains a lot. This is especially so for people who are travelling from London to Paris. Every day about 20 trains leave London. They travel at a very high speed and people feel glad that the trains take only 2 hours and 30 minutes to reach Paris. It's much faster to travel by train than by bus or by car. This is because people have to drive cars or buses very carefully and lowly for many reasons, such as speed limits and traffic jams. However, when you are travelling by train, the speed is almost the same and there is no traffic jam for a train. Besides, Londoners think taking a train is one of the safest ways of travelling on the ground. Trains take quite a number of quality tests while they are made. More importantly, they have to take many safety checks before they are used on the rail track. What's more, trains in Britain are comfortable and provide fine services for their users. When you are on a London train, you will find that the train has comfortable tables and seats where people can sit. They also provide food services and power plugs  for personal computers or mobile phone. What can we know from the passage?", "subject": ""}
{"answer": 1, "choices": ["Growing", "Eating", "Processing", "Making"], "question": "\"You are what you eat,\" says the old saying. So how can we know what food is healthy? Unluckily, a lot of food that looks good may have pollution. Where is the pollution from? It has something to do with how people produce food: growing it on the farm, processing  it in factories, and making it ready for you to eat. Here's what happens: Most farmers use chemicals  to stop their crops from getting sick. Many of these chemicals remain in the food that you eat. Some people believe this may cause cancer. These chemicals may also pollute water and air, and kill animals and even people by accident. Most drinks are just flavored water  . Every drink coming in plastic bottles which you then throw away means a waste. Sugary drinks make you fat. In the factories, much of what you eat and drink gets messed. Often things are put into food to make it delicious and look good but they might be harmful to people. And some food like meat often gets polluted by bacteria. What you can do: Try to get organic  food. Organic food doesn't have any ingredients  that are bad for the land, air or water. Don't eat processed food or drinks. Eat fresh food whenever you can and cook at home. Which of the following processes cannot make the food be polluted?", "subject": ""}

Soon Ben came along the road. He was happily eating an apple. He stopped to look at Tom. Tom went on painting and pretended not to see Ben. \"I'm going swimming,\" said Ben. \"Do you want to go swimming, Tom? But I guess you can't. You have to stay and work, don't you?\" \"Work?\" Tom said. \"This isn't work. I'm enjoying myself. Does a boy get a chance to paint a fence like this every day?\" Ben thought about this. Tom continued painting carefully. Sometimes he stopped, stood back to look at the fence like an artist, and then added a bit more paint in just the right place. Ben was watching Tom paint with great interest. He was getting more and more eager to have a try himself. After a while, Ben asked Tom if he would let him paint a little. Tom thought about it, and said, \"No, Ben, I can't. You see. Aunt Polly wants it to be done well. Aunt Polly said that I must paint it with great care.\" \"Oh, please, Tom,\" begged Ben. \"I can do it. I'll be really careful. Just let me try. I'll give you half of my apple. Well, I'll give you all of it!\" \"Well, all right, Ben,\" said Tom. \"You must be very careful.\" He gave Ben his brush with worry on his face but joy in his heart. He sat down under the tree, and started to eat Ben's apple. All day, boys came to make fun of Tom, but they ended up staying to paint. When Ben got tired, Billy was waiting. He gave Tom a kite for a chance to paint. Then Johnny offered him a basketball, and so on. By late afternoon Tom had got all kinds of toys, and the fence had got three coats of paint. Later Aunt Polly came to look at the painted fence. She was so pleased with Tom's work that she gave Tom a large cake!

I knew it wasn't very good and the grades that I get showed I was not hard-working enough. I realized that I needed to find some kind of balance. So I created a timetable that would divide my time between studying and relaxing. It was a good idea but I was only able to follow it for a few days because it made me under too much pressure. Later, I tried another plan. Each week I listed everything that I had to get done during the week and the time by which I had to get it done. Then under the things I had to do, I made another list of things that I could do if I had time. It worked really well. Ever since I have never missed any important things.

You know the general appearance of both flesh and bone from the parts of animals which you see in the butcher's shop. Bone is hard, and of a white color; indeed, it looks more like a piece of wood or stone than a part of a living animal. But bone is a real part of the living body, and it grows and is nourished  just as the body is. If a man breaks the bone of his arm or his leg, it is firmly bound up, to prevent the broken parts from moving out of the proper places, and in time then bone grows together again and becomes quite strong. The bones are fastened together by various kinds of joints . They form the framework of the body, and give it strength to retain its proper shape. This framework is called the skeleton . Some animals, such as worms and slugs, have no skeleton; and others, such as shellfish, have a kind of hard covering or skeleton outside. The most important part of the skeleton is the backbone. It is so important that naturalists divide all animals into two classes,--- those which have a backbone and those which have none.

This means they can take a year off to do something else, before they start their studies.

Many parents, teachers and business people agree that travelling can teach important values. \"After a year of travelling, I felt I'd grown up.

Although you don't get paid for your work, this kind of work can teach important skills---decision making and finding answers to problems, for example---that will help many students in a job one day. Finally, getting some knowledge and experience in an area you hope to study or work in one day will always be very useful. If several university graduates are applying  for the same job, gar year work experience allows you to say, \" I've already had some experience of this kind of work.\" And that can get your job.

More than 2,000 high school teachers took an online survey. 75 percent of the teachers said the Internet and digital search tools have had a \"mostly good\" use for their students' research habits and skills, But 87 percent agreed that these technologies \"make the students not have enough attention.\" And 64 percent said the technologies \"do little to help them in courses.\" Judy Buchanan is a director of the National Writing Project. Ms. Buchanan says digital research tools are helping students learn more, and learn faster. Teachers really like these tools, because they are ways to make some of learning exciting. Young people enjoy using these tools. And the goal is to help them become creative students of meaningful work, and not just that kind of copyist. But one problem the survey found is that many students don't have a good understanding of how to use the digital knowledge well. In other words, they trust  too much of the information. Judy Buchanan says these students have not developed the skills they need to tell whether the online information is good or bad. Another problem the survey found is something that might not seem like a problem, at all, being-able to quickly find information online. Teachers say the ability of their students to work hard to find answers is becoming weaker. They say students depend too much on search engines   and do not make enough use, of printed books or research, librarians. Besides, many teachers are also worried about the problem that the Internet makes it easy for students to copy work done by others, instead of using their own abilities.

His idea of the bionic eye is actually an eye that has been built in a small video camera. The test results show the bionic eye has given blind patients the amazing ability to see the scientists doing the tests. But the images are still blurry  and we need much work before the eye actually becomes a regular implant  into blind people. Humayun believes that he can go into production with the bionic eye over the next three to five years. A closer look at the bionic eye is amazing. The patient wears a special set of eyeglasses. All the signals  are passed to the implanted eye. It's done by wireless technology. Humayun has created an invention that could change the lives of millions of people. Imagine a world in which someone would no longer fear about being blind. This could be considered a technological achievement. How long will it take Doctor Humayun to produce his bionic eye?", "subject": ""}

{"answer": 1, "choices": ["English.", "German.", "French.", "Russian."], "question": "Where did that number come from? Eleven and Twelve The reason behind the change in number naming is that eleven comes from the German term ainlif, which translates to \"one left\". Twelve follows the same rule.

There is something sadly lost in history. 911 for US Emergency   Calls Early phones didn't use phone numbers--the operator had to connect your call by hand--and this led to the need for an emergency code  . But later phone numbers became popular, that changed. In 1967, 911 was chosen as the nationwide emergency call because it was easy to  remember and could be quickly dialed   on the phone. 26.2 Miles in a Marathon   The story began with an ancient Greek soldier carrying message from a battlefield   in Marathon to Athens. The modern marathon was born as a flagship event in the first Olympic Games, in 1896, with a distance   of about 25 miles (40 km), as long as the distance from Marathon to Athens. But race organizers for the 1908 Olympic Games in London wanted to add something special. The race began at Windsor Castle and ended at White City Stadium, with runners finishing only after passing the royal   box. The distance was 26.2 miles (42.1 km). And since 1924 this distance has been kept in marathon. 28 Days in February Before using the Gregorian calendar that we use today, one of the first Roman calendars had only 304 days and ten months (March through December), with six months of 30 days and four of 31 days. The second king of Rome improved the old calendar. He added 50 days for January and February. To make the new months longer, he took one day from each of the 30-day months, making 56 days to divide between January and February (or 28 days each). Later January was given one more day to add up to 355 days a year, but February still had 28 days. That's how it became the shortest month and it stayed that way ever since.

Right or wrong? You decide. Compared with 50 years ago, when I was just four years old, people now make nearly three times as much money, eat one third more food and expect to live one third longer. In fact, it's hard to find any areas of the world that's worse off  now than it was then, even though the world population has more than doubled over that period. One reason we are richer, healthier, taller, cleverer, longer-lived and freer than ever before is that the four most basic human needs--food, clothing, fuel and shelter--have grown much cheaper. Take one example: In 1800, a candle providing one hour's light cost six hours' work. In the 1880s, the same light from a lamp took 15 minutes' work to pay for. In 1950, it was eight seconds. Today, it's half a second. In these terms, we are 43,200 times better off than in1800. In the United States, rivers, lakes, seas and air are getting cleaner all the time. A car today produces less pollution traveling at full speed than a parked car did from leaks   in 1970. Although the world population is growing, the rate   of increase has been falling for 50 years. Across the world, national birth rates are lower now than in 1960, and in the less developed world, the birth rate has almost halved. According to a research report from the United Nations, population will start falling once it reaches 9.2 billion in 2075. After all, there are already seven billion people on earth, and they are eating better and better. In 1970s, there were 550 billion barrels   of oil reserves   in the world, and in the 20 years that followed the world used up 600 billion. So by 1990, reserves should have been overused by 50 billion barrels. Instead, it is reported there are 900 billion today. They will last for many years and people will find something in place of oil long before they run out. The more we develop, the more we can develop. The more we invent, the more inventions become possible. For 200 years, pessimists (people who believe that terrible things will happen in future) have had all the headlines--even though _ have far more often been right.
