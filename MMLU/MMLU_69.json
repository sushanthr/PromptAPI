Each year, the honor is given to an inventor who has made a big difference in the lives of people in developing countries. Gadgil is a professor and physicist at the University of California, Berkeley. He spent thirty years helping people in need. His inventions have helped more than 100 million people around the world. \"I chose to focus on problems where my knowledge of science  could help,\" Gadgil said. In the 1990s, Gadgil designed his first life-saving invention after more than 10,000 people died from Bengal cholera   because of the clean water crisis   in India. His invention uses ultraviolet light to kill deadly disease-carrying germs   from drinking water. It costs just one cent to clean five liters of water (about 21 cups). So far, the invention has provided safe drinking water for more than five million people in India and other developing countries. Gadgil's another important invention is the Berkeley-Darfur Stove  . The long and violent war in Darfur, Sudan, has caused many people to move to foreign countries and live in refugee camps  . They are given food aid. But people still have to travel a long distance five times a week to gather firewood to cook meals. This can be dangerous because of street violence in the area. To avoid danger, some spend much of their money used to feed their families buying firewood. The stove Gadgil created cuts fuel usage by 55%. That means people wouldn't have to leave the camps to find firewood as often. The invention also helps to save homes more than $300 a year. About 125,000 people and their families have been helped.

{"answer": 1, "choices": ["The short-term memory becomes stronger.", "The short-term memory becomes weaker.", "The long-term memory becomes stronger.", "The long-term memory becomes weaker."], "question": "Memory is essential  for life. We have a short-term memory and a long-term memory. When we get old, our short-term memory becomes weaker, but we can still remember things that happened a long time ago. There are many things we can do to improve our memory, such as using various memorizing methods as well as taking special care of our health. It is important that we regularly stimulate  our brain to make our memory more efficient . For example, we can do activities that we do not usually do and change our daily habits. Learning a new skill helps our brain develop. When trying to memorize something, we should focus our attention on the most important things about it. Do not allow other thoughts to enter our mind because this will lower our chances of remembering things correctly. One basic way of improving our memory is to use the link method. If we want to memorize something, we should make a picture in our mind. If the picture is silly, strange and colourful, we will remember it better. Taking notes, being organized and keeping a diary will also be useful tools. Sometimes, memory is connected with our feelings. When something dramatic happens, we usually remember it well, and we also remember where we were and what we were doing. Healthy food and plenty of vitamins are important to our memory. Drinking a lot of water also helps maintain our memory. When we are asleep, our brain stores memory. Not enough sleep can, therefore, cause problems with storing information. In addition, being tired will stop us from being able to remember well. As a result, keeping fit and having regular health checks are both important as well.

Do not allow other thoughts to enter our mind because this will lower our chances of remembering things correctly. One basic way of improving our memory is to use the link method. If we want to memorize something, we should make a picture in our mind. If the picture is silly, strange and colourful, we will remember it better. Taking notes, being organized and keeping a diary will also be useful tools. Sometimes, memory is connected with our feelings. When something dramatic happens, we usually remember it well, and we also remember where we were and what we were doing. Healthy food and plenty of vitamins are important to our memory. Drinking a lot of water also helps maintain our memory. When we are asleep, our brain stores memory. Not enough sleep can, therefore, cause problems with storing information. In addition, being tired will stop us from being able to remember well. As a result, keeping fit and having regular health checks are both important as well.

{"answer": 3, "choices": ["move downwards", "move upwards", "go out of the window", "stick to their eyes"], "question": "SPACE is a lonely place. Hundreds of thousands of kilometers from home, astronauts have a hard life. It stands to reason that, once in a while, they need to have a good cry. But this is a lot harder than it sounds. We still know very little about space, and about living in zero gravity. In fact, we are discovering new things every time astronauts take to the skies (and beyond). As The Atlantic reported in January, crying is not all that simple in space. This is because when a person normally cries,  gravity makes their tears move downwards. But in a spacecraft, this is not the case. Here, there is no gravity, which is why we so often see pictures of astronauts floating around. This means that, strangely, when you cry your tears have nowhere to go. As a result, they just stick to your eyes. In May 2011, astronaut Andrew Feustel experienced this. \"Tears,\" as he said, \"don't fall off your eye... they just kind of stay there. \" This can be quite painful. In space, your eyes get very dry, and the added moisture is irritating  . Sometimes, things get even weirder .

Then I have a dream to join the University Student Volunteer Go West Program. I think I can be a teacher in the west. I would like to devote my life to helping the children there. I want to make the world a better place for them. To make it come true, I will work harder in the next two years. There is an old saying \"Where there is a will, there is a way\". I think my dream will come true in the near future. At last, I want to say to everybody, \"Try your best to realize your dreams, no matter how big or small they are.

Maybe not. New research into the reasons for shark attacks   suggests that sharks don't like the way humans taste! In fact, most people who are attacked by the shark are still alive after receiving only one bite  . Why is this? There are many opinions to explain why sharks sometimes attack people. One opinion is that sharks are just curious  . We know that sharks are the strongest animals in their environment, so they are not afraid of anything. Naturally, that means they are curious when they meet something unusual. Because they don't have hands or feet., the only way they can find out an object is to bite it! It is thought that sharks sometimes bite humans for this reason, and then swim away. Scientists also say that sharks would not waste energy trying to eat a human, as we have a lot of bones  . It is hard for a shark to eat us because sharks don't have hands, and they can't pull the meat off our bones. Maybe that's why they only bite us once. Unluckily, one bite from a large shark is serious enough to hurt people greatly! Another opinion is that sharks attack humans by mistake. Some sharks may sometimes mistake humans for a seal. An example of this is when a shark  attacks a surfer. A surfer lying on a surfboard looks like a seal when seen from below. Sharks like seals because they have thick fat.

{"answer": 2, "choices": ["What passwords are.", "How a password is hacked.", "How to make your password much safer.", "Why hackers hack your password."], "question": "Always forgetting your long passwords ? Worried about being hacked ?All these worries will soon become history. Scientists have found that upper-casing your password can help you reduce the chance being hacked. Usually passwords are six letters or more.However,50 percent of people choose a common word or simple key combination for their password. The most used passwords are 123456, abcdef and abc123. In fact, if your passwords are in lower-case ,it will be easily hacked by a hacker. According to a study, it only takes a hacker ten minutes to hack a six-letter password which is in lower-case, but if you make the letter in upper-case, it can take up to ten hours. So if you want to make your account much safer, you should make your password upper-case. Of course, you can also add numbers or _ to your password. Most of the time a hacker's computer has to work for 18 days to break a password, but if you choose a nine-letter password that includes numbers and symbols, it can take a hacher's  computer 44,530 years to break it.

Ears are for hearing, skin is for feeling and noses are for smelling. Would anyone say that ears can smell, or that tongues can see? Actually, yes. Paul Bach-y-Rita, a scientist at the University of Wisconsin, believes that the senses can changeable. For example, a tongue can be used for seeing. The brain, as we know, is a complex organ . Even when part of it is hurt, it will try to carry out the same function by sending the function to another area of the brain. A college student was asked to take part in an experiment. In the experiment, his eyes were covered with a small video camera. The camera was connected to a long plastic line which went into his mouth. A computer would change the video's picture. The picture would travel through the plastic line as an electric current , reaching the electrodes  inside the student's mouth. The scientist would roll a ball towards his right side, left side, or centre, and the student would have to catch it. When the scientist rolled the ball, pain passed over the student's tongue. For the position of the pain on the tongue, the student reached out his hand and caught the ball. If the brain can see a ball through a camera and a wet tongue, blindness and deafness can be overcame. What could be the best title for the passage?", "subject": ""}

We went into a big market and saw crazy signs, fun T-shirts, and things like hand-made earrings for sale. We bought Chinese fried noodles.

Like the planets, they go around the sun. But comets are not made of solid rocks like planets. A comet is a ball of dust, stones, and ice. Many people call comets dirty snowballs. The \"snowball\" may be only a few miles across. But when the sun heats the \"snowball,\" much of it is changed to gases. The gases spread out and form the comet's head, which may be thousands of miles across. A comet moves fast in its trip around the sun. But when we see it, the comet does not seem to move. That's because it is so far away. The moon moves fast, but when you look at it, you can't see any motion . That's because the moon is far away. Each year astronomers  discover new comets. Some of them are seen only once. They make one trip around the sun and then go away out into space. The sun's gravity cannot hold them. Other comets, like Halley, keep returning. They have been captured by the sun. Halley's earliest visit was probably 3,000 years ago. It may keep returning for another 3,000 years. But every time a comet goes around the sun, the comet loses part of itself. Gases and dust are pulled out of the comet. That's why Halley is now dimmer  than it used to be.

{"answer": 1, "choices": ["make a comparison", "introduce a topic", "describe a pretty flower", "build a new theory"], "question": "It is easy for us to tell who our family members are, but do plants recognize  their own family? Some do, scientists say, according to a report by Science News in early 2010. Guillermo P. Murphy and Susan Dudley are two plant scientists from McMaster University in Hamilton, Canada. They did a few experiments with Jewelweeds, a kind of flower that grows in wet, shady spots. They found that the flowers seem to know their own flower family. In their experiments, Murphy and Dudley planted jewelweeds in pots with either _ or strangers. When jewelweeds were planted in pots with strangers, the plants started to grow more leaves than if they had been planted alone. This response suggests that plants are competing with strangers for sunlight, since a plant with more leaves can receive more light and make more food. Jewelweeds usually grow in the shade, where sunlight is not enough. When jewelweed seedlings were planted with siblings, they grew a few more branches than they usually would if they were alone - but they did not start growing lots of extra leaves. This behavior suggests the plants are more likely to share resources, rather than compete. According to the Science News report, Jewelweeds are not the first plants that plant scientists have studied for family recognition. In 2007, Dudley and her team studied the Great Lakes sea rocket, a plant that grows on the beach - where it may be hard to get fresh water. In that experiment, the scientists found that when sea rockets were planted with siblings, they tolerated each other. But when they were planted with strangers, the sea rockets reacted by working extra hard to grow lots of roots.

{"answer": 2, "choices": ["New Discoveries about Plants", "How Plants Compete with Each Other", "Family Recognition among Plants", "Jewelweeds and the Great Lakes Sea Rockets"], "question": "It is easy for us to tell who our family members are, but do plants recognize  their own family? Some do, scientists say, according to a report by Science News in early 2010. Guillermo P. Murphy and Susan Dudley are two plant scientists from McMaster University in Hamilton, Canada. They did a few experiments with Jewelweeds, a kind of flower that grows in wet, shady spots. They found that the flowers seem to know their own flower family. In their experiments, Murphy and Dudley planted jewelweeds in pots with either _ or strangers. When jewelweeds were planted in pots with strangers, the plants started to grow more leaves than if they had been planted alone. This response suggests that plants are competing with strangers for sunlight, since a plant with more leaves can receive more light and make more food. Jewelweeds usually grow in the shade, where sunlight is not enough. When jewelweed seedlings were planted with siblings, they grew a few more branches than they usually would if they were alone - but they did not start growing lots of extra leaves. This behavior suggests the plants are more likely to share resources, rather than compete. According to the Science News report, Jewelweeds are not the first plants that plant scientists have studied for family recognition. In 2007, Dudley and her team studied the Great Lakes sea rocket, a plant that grows on the beach - where it may be hard to get fresh water. In that experiment, the scientists found that when sea rockets were planted with siblings, they tolerated each other. But when they were planted with strangers, the sea rockets reacted by working extra hard to grow lots of roots. Dudley says this just because sea rockets, on the beach, get plenty of sun but struggle for water - so when they're threatened, they compete for water. Jewelweeds have plenty of water but have to compete for sunshine, so they grow more leaves. What can be the best title for the passage?", "subject": ""}

When young children are about one year old, they start to yawn when they see others yawning. That's why scientists seem to think yawning is contagious. It's no secret that yawning is contagious, but why do we yawn? Well, scientists are not really sure. Some think we yawn because we feel bored. Recently scientists studied two groups of students between the ages of 17 and 19. One group watched music videos, and the other watched a boring color test. Scientists compared the numbers of their yawns and found that the color test group yawned more times than the video group. Another reason for yawning has to do with breathing. Some scientists believe that when we are bored or tired, we breathe more slowly. As our breathing slows down, we cannot get rid of  enough carbon dioxide, our bodies will tell the brains to breathe deeply. The result is a big yawn. In 2007, scientists suggested a new reason.

{"answer": 2, "choices": ["A planet.", "A spacecraft.", "A body that orbits a planet.", "A black star."], "question": "In the sunny night, look up at the clear night sky. You can probably see thousands of stars. The biggest thing you'll see, of course, is the moon. For thousands of years, people have wondered about this big thing in the sky. Earth's moon is a satellite. A satellite is a body that orbits a planet. All moons are satellites, and many planets have them. Some have many moons. Earth, of course, only has one. It's a special moon, though. It's the fifth largest moon in the solar system! In fact, the moon is much smaller than the sun. But it's much closer to Earth, so it looks as big as the sun. The moon is so close that you can see its dark and light spots without a telescope. Men flew and landed on the moon's surface many times by spacecrafts in the 1960s and 1970s.

Within minutes the cashier said, \"I have too much money.\" The cashier didn't need our ten-dollar bills. Then the lady in front of me, who had been the first to offer help, said, \"Wait! I didn't even get a chance to give anything!\" I smiled at her and said, \"You did your share, because it was your idea and you started all this. \" The little boy smiled and thanked us. We wished him the best and he left. I was left with a good feeling. I had seen the love and goodness of others all around me.

A few days later, the man saw a small hole in the cocoon. He sat and watched for several hours as a butterfly struggled to force its body through that little hole. Then it stopped. So the man decided to help the butterfly. He took a knife and cut a bigger hole in the cocoon. The butterfly came out of the cocoon but it had a weak body and small, thin wings. The butterfly didn't start to fly. In fact, the butterfly spent the rest of its life crawling  around with a weak body and thin wings. It was never able to fly.

{"answer": 1, "choices": ["Hobbies and habits.", "Children and pets.", "Sports and games.", "Likes and dislikes."], "question": "Living next to next is the principle   of a neighbor. Good neighborliness is the ideal to be aimed at. As the saying goes, no man is an island; he has to live with his neighbors. To make life easy and pleasant, he must cooperate with his neighbors. Whether one likes it or not, one cannot do without neighbors. Normally one may think he can do without neighbors because he can manage all comforts and services, so the services or the need for a friend may not happen. However, the sympathy  , admiration and appreciation which a neighbor may offer will have a great humanizing influence. To share one's view and sometimes even sadness, one needs some neighbors. But all neighbors are not always keeping the friendly relationship. Stresses and tension   develop because of misunderstanding. Very often children may be the cause for tense feelings. The neighbor's son may pick a flower or a fruit from your garden and an argument may follow. Again he may throw his ball at your window breaking it. These are common cases so far as the younger one is concerned but it is for the elders to view them with calmness and make up for it. This may read easy on paper but not so in real life. But being broad minded, one must be able to tolerate  . Another reason for tension may be the animals. Your neighbor's dog may be a real trouble or his chickens would come into your garden and eat away your plants. In all these cases to keep up good neighborliness, some understanding between the neighbors is important. _ Try to be friendly and the problem will not be difficult to solve. Care can at times play a good part and help the neighbors in a small or big way. Nobody is perfect and it is better not to speak ill of your neighbors. A cheerful word, a nod or a small talk will strengthen the feeling of good neighborliness. Neighborliness is not only for people but it is also largely important between neighboring countries. History has got a lot to teach on this. Unless countries learn to live as good neighbors, there cannot be peace on earth. So children must be taught at home and in the school to cooperate with the neighbors and be friendly with them. The basic rule is to give and take and to develop a sense that the other man has as much right as you do, and some degree of tolerance is very necessary.

Even her arms and back started aching, she didn't give up. The trip up had taken 30 minutes while going back down took twice that. Andi's husband received her messages at last. He and their son, Justin, jumped into the car and drove to pick up Andi. Later that morning, an X-ray showed that the bull dog was badly hurt, he was likely to lose his left leg. A few days later, the Davises returned to the animal hospital. \"The first thing he did was to give me a kiss, then he went right to my son.\" Andi said.

{"answer": 0, "choices": ["to suggest we should keep up with the times", "to show us the future of modern Olympics", "to prove that the athletes have done better", "to introduce high-tech sports equipment"], "question": "It's hard to believe how times have changed since the first modern Olympics were held in Athens, Greece, on 6th April 1896. Over one hundred years ago, there was very little reliance(dependence)on modern technology. There were no landing mats , no stopwatches and no photo finishes. In fact, cameras and stopwatches were not used until the 1932 Olympic Games in Los Angeles, the USA. Today technology has completely revolutionized(changed) sports. Take sports equipment for example. Starting blocks are now equipped with electronic pressure sensors , which provide exactly correct race time and also help to catch runners who \"jump the gun\". As athletes cross the finishing line, special digital cameras can also easily decide the winner. The clays of \" _ \" are gone. Athletes have also benefited  from technological developments. Body-hug-ging suits, which reduce  wind drag, can help cut up to one-tenth of a second from runners' race times. Top athletes are even provided with tailor-made sports shoes. These shoes are made to fit the athlete exactly--and there are even air compartments in the shoes that can be filled to meet each runner's individual needs. Technology has also changed the way that many sports are performed. Take one example--the pole vault . The inclusion of a landing mat obviously made a big difference to the vaulting style as athletes no longer needed to worry about hurting themselves as they fell. Without these worries, athletes could obviously jump higher. These days, polevaulters do not even need to worry about the crossbar as the uprights are now fitted with light-emitting diodes(LEDs) that measure  how high the athlete vaulted. Technology has even been to the advantage of swimmers. New pools have been designed to reduce wave interference and sports scientists have even developed a new style of swimming that increases buoyancy and reduces drag in the water. The increasing importance of these technological developments has led many sportsmen to suggest that the \"Olympic spirit\" is being lost in a rush to break records and win medals. Many developing countries say that technology has become too important in sport and that athletes from developing countries that cannot afford such technology are disadvantaged. There are no easy answers but one thing is sure--we cannot turn back time. Technology cannot go backwards. The purpose of the writer in writing this article is   _  .", "subject": ""}
