Children in immersion programs hear only the new language in the classroom.The children play games, sing songs and talk to one another in the new languages, some experts   say immersion programs are the most effective   way for young children to learn a language.But there can be a problem when children in the United States begin to learn another language at such an early age.Not many elementary schools continue to teach a foreign language.Only seven of the fifty states require   schools to teach a foreign language to students between the ages of six and twelve.Language experts say it is easier for younger children to learn a language.Still, American schools generally do not begin to teach foreign languages until secondary schools.By then, students are about thirteen years old. American schools face difficult choices about the cost of educational programs.The government has increased support for foreign language study in its education law called No Child Left Behind.

Each age has its pleasures and its pains , and the happiest person is the one who enjoys what each age gives him without wasting his time in useless regrets . Childhood is a time when there are few responsibilities  to make life difficult. If a child has good parents, he is fed, looked after and loved, whatever he may do. It is impossible that he will ever again in his life be given so much without having to do anything in return. What's more, life is always giving new things to the child--- things that have lost their interest for older people because they are too well-known. But a child has his pains: he is not so free to do what he wishes to do; he is repeatedly being told not do something or being punished for what he has wrongly done. When a young man starts to earn his own living, he can no longer expect others to pay for his food, his clothes, and his room, but has to work if he wants to live comfortably. If he spends most of his time playing about in the way he used to as a child, he will go hungry. And if he breaks the laws of society  as he used to break the laws of his parents, he may go to prison.

First there's self-honesty. Is what people see the real article or do you appear through smoke and mirrors?

I love how singer Judy Garland put it, \"Always be a first-class version   of yourself, instead of a second-class version of somebody else.\" Then there's honesty in our actions. Are you honest at school, with your parents, and with your boss? If you've ever been dishonest, I think we all have. Try being honest, and notice how well it makes you feel. Remember, you can't do wrong and feel right. This story by Jeff is a good example of that: In my second year of study, there were three kids in my math class who didn't do well. I was really good at it. I would charge them three dollars for each test that I helped them pass. I'd write on a little piece of paper all the right answers, and hand them off. At first I felt like I was making money, kind of a nice job. I wasn't thinking about how it could hurt all of us. After a while I realized I shouldn't do that anymore, because I wasn't really helping them. They weren't learning anything, and it would only get harder down the road. Cheating certainly wasn't helping me. It takes courage to be honest when people all around you are getting away with cheating on tests, lying to their parents, and stealing at work.

{"answer": 1, "choices": ["To improve the environment.", "To make the land use plan.", "To make new discoveries.", "To count the crops in a field."], "question": "Geography is the study of Earth and its climates. Scientists use it to study global warming and track the weather. Governments use it to learn where people live and work and to plan what to do with the land. It is now easier than ever to use geography because of a science called space technology. The United States launched its first satellite in 1958. Some space missions that followed were geographical studies. In fact, earth science is a big part of the work of the National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA). Astronauts looked out of the space shuttle. They decided to take photographs of Earth from their vantage point. Over the years, picture quality improved. Shuttle photography now shows land features, such as rivers. It can even show the streets of large cities. Photos of the same places at different times show how the land is changing. NASA does not use just photographs, though. In 1958 it launched TIROS (the Television Infrared Observation Satellite). This first use of a satellite to study Earth was effective in giving weather forecasts. It led to the creation of new space tools to use in geography. The Landsat Program began in 1972. This satellite sent detailed views of Earth from space. The pictures were so precise that scientists could count the number and kinds of crops in a field. Landsat showed where Earth's surface had faults along which earthquakes might happen. This information helped in the planning of new cities and factories. Landsat also made discoveries. In Antarctica it located ranges of unknown mountains. It pinpointed small lakes in Virginia that were no ton maps. Landsat, now more advanced, still flies today. Another space tool is Earth Observing-1 (EO-1). This spacecraft flies right behind Landsat. It takes pictures of the same sites. The two sets of pictures, viewed together, show how cities grow and how other places, such as rain forests, become smaller over time. This helps scientists learn how people affect geography. One of the newest space tools is the Geographical Information Systems (GIS). GIS is computer software that helps scientists to study Earth. GIS is different from earlier space tools. Businesses, schools, and even average people -- not just the government --can use it to show them how changes in the planet might affect them.

But I am afraid you are wrong. If you don't believe, you may do a small experiment . First, put two objects with the same weight into two boxes. Then cover the boxes. Wrap  one box with a red piece of paper, the other with a white piece of paper. Now hold the boxes with your hand one by one. It is certain that you will think the red one is a little heavier. Why does it happen? A scientist found that different colours have different weight in a man's mind. So he did many tests and at last he got the result. That is to say, every colour has its own weight in our mind. The heaviest colour is red, then blue, green, orange, yellow and white. The scientists told us that colours also have smell. Can you smell the colour? Of course not. Then why did the scientists say so? That is because every colour represents a kind of light wave ------ a certain wavelength .

{"answer": 1, "choices": ["6", "7", "8", "9"], "question": "As you are soon on your way to Eastern Europe, here are a few tips on what you should pack. In general, pack lightly, with only the most basic clothes. People dress casually  in Eastern Europe, so you don't need to bring along your smartest clothing. Batteries: If your camera, flash, or other appliances run on batteries, bring enough supply along. Certain types of batteries don't exist in Eastern Europe, and those that do often don't last very long. Cash: We have found it good to have supply of small-unit U.S. bills($1and $5) to use in hard-currency stores, to buy international train tickets, etc. The hard-currency stores never seem to have the right _ . Electric Current Adapter : If you bring any appliances, remember that the electricity in Eastern Europe uses 220 volts A.C., not the standard 110 volts of North America. A 110 volts appliance will soon burn out when attached to an unchanged 220-volt plug. Language Tools: One of Europe's biggest challenges is communicating with the local people since their languages are so different from our own. To help overcome difficulties, you might buy phrasebooks before you go -- you won't find them once you are in Eastern Europe. Money Belt: A money belt is especially helpful when you have many documents to carry around ( as you always do in Eastern Europe). The best one we find is made by Eagle Greek Travel Gear, 143 Cedros Ave. (P. O. box 651), Solona Beach, CA 92075 (tel. 619/755 - 9399, or toll free 800/874 - 9925) outside California.

But road cycling is fast catching up as the preferred way of networking recently. \"When you play golf with somebody you have to decide if you\"re going to beat them, or let thembeat you,\" says Peter Murray, a chairman of the NLA centre. \"If they\"re your customers and youdon\"t want to beat them, sometimes you might have to make some kind of cheating in order to lose. That seems to me  not a good way of doing things.\" Group cycling, and especially long-distance riding, is a shared experience, Mr Murray says. Riders often work together and help each other out, taking turns to be at the front so that the riders in their group can save almost a third of the effort needed to travel at the same speed. How someone rides a bike can give you a real insight into what a person is like, says Jean-Jacques Lorraine, founding director of Morrow Lorraine, a team member of Cycle to Cannes. \"Some riders are very single-minded, others more collaborative; some are skillful, others an open book.\"\"If I walk into a meeting and somebody says ,,I\"ve done Cycle to Cannes\" , it\"s a done deal really,\" says Mr Lorraine. Mr Mottram, CEO of Rapha, believes it is easier to get to know people by cycling than in other situations. \"T here is an easy environment about conversations on a bike.\" Mr Lorraine makes the point more directly: \"I feel open and honest to others. I often find I\"m saying things on a bike which I wouldn\"t normally say, and equally I\"ve been confided   in when I wasn\"t expecting it.\" Why do cycle rides lend riders so well to networking? \"Getting a quick lunch or drink after work doesn\"t give you long enough to get to know someone,\" Mr. Murray says. He believes long ridesget people together. \"A younger rider can be cycling along with a boss and help him in some wayand you get a reversal of the relationship.  This changes the relationship when they are off theride too.\" Perhaps the main reason why cycling is a good way to network is that it\"s a passion   and away of life. \"Getting out on the bike is what we\"re all dreaming of doing while we\"re sitting at our computers,\" says  Mr Mottram.

{"answer": 1, "choices": ["long distances", "difficult climates", "fresh and tasty food", "modern technology"], "question": "Nowadays, the food that you buy comes from many different countries. Have a look in your fridge, cupboard, and fruit bowl and check the origins  of the food. Perhaps there are apples from California, lamb from New Zealand, or potatoes from Egypt? You will probably be surprised how far food travels to get to your plate. This journey, from \"field to plate\", is called \"food miles\". A food mile is the distance that food travels from the farmer's field to the person who buys the food. Nowadays, food often travels thousands of miles to get to the consumer . Why is this, and what are the effects  of these long distances? Traditionally, farmers sold their food in the local market, so the food didn't have to travel very far. The consumers also did not travel very far because they want to their local market to buy the food. This was a good system for farmers and consumers. However, there were some disadvantages. For example, consumers could only buy food that farmers produced locally. In addition, they could only get food that was in season. Now, because of modern technology, food comes from all over the world. We do not have to wait for spring or summer to buy strawberries or tomatoes. They are _ in winter if we want. Some countries have to import  most of their food. This is because they have difficult climates. The United Arab Emirates (UAE), for example, gets 85% of its food from other countries. Even food made in the UAE often uses imported materials. What's wrong with \"food miles\"? Is this not a good way of increasing international trade? I believe these miles are worrying for a number of reasons. First of all, because food travels such long distances, we need more planes, lorries, and ships to move the food. This means we use more oil or petrol, so there is more pollution and more global  warming. In addition, foo that travels a long way is not fresh and usually not very tasty. Tomatoes, for example, are picked early and stored for their long journeys. For this reason, they are usually tasteless when they get to the consumer. Local food has a better taste, and it also reduces the amount of global pollution. We need to buy more local food.

Yet English words do not stay the same. The language is always changing. We need new words for new inventions and new ideas. Different words come into use, or older words are used in a new way.

Now new space and science words are being borrowed from other countries, too. New words are also made by adding two words together. Strawberry, popcorn, and grandfather are words made up of two parts. Sometimes new words are shorter forms of older words.

Among them, half wish to study at the undergraduate level. UK students have increasing interest in studying or working in a European country through the EU's Erasmus Program, an EU student exchange program started in 1987. Recent Erasmus statistics  show that nearly 15,600 UK students spent up to a year in another European country through the program during 2013-2014 school year, up 115 percent since 2007. The figures reflect that more young people in the UK are realizing the value of receiving international experience. \"The UK needs graduates who have the skills and confidence to compete worldwide, and can compete against foreign talent that may speak more languages and have wider international experience,\" said Rebecca Hughes, director of education at the British Council. Most UK students would like to go to the United States, followed by Australia, France, Canada and Germany, the findings show, but 42 percent of those who took the questionnaire were interested in traveling outside of the English-speaking world. Why do UK students want to go abroad? Among those who are interested in overseas study, nearly 50 percent want to have fun traveling and exploring different cultures, while 30 percent want to work for an international company and live overseas. About 15 percent said they wanted to go to the best university and get the best education offered worldwide. What's more, the high cost of UK university studies plays a role in over half of students' interest in overseas study. Also, the study found the biggest schooling check to studying abroad was a lack of foreign language skills--chosen by over half of those who were not interested or had not made a decision about studying overseas.

But what's surprising is that our personality can also say something about our health. That's according to researchers at Duke University, US.

The study found that those who were careful at age 26 were in better health after 12 years. Being careful means that people tend to have a lot of self-control, and are less likely to smoke, the scientists said. Careful people are also more likely to have an active lifestyle and healthy diet. From those who were least careful, 45 percent developed health problems by the age of 38. Such health issues included gum disease and high blood pressure  . To compare, only 18 percent of careful people went on to develop health problems.

In fact, it is not that difficult to learn new words, but to remember them for a lifetime seems not to be so easy. To make it easier, you can try word associations . Try to find a connection between a new word and things or people you know. For example, if your neighbour is an unselfish person who cares about the needs of other people, think about this person every time you see the word, and very soon you'll start actively using it. Try to use the words you learn as often as possible. Perhaps you are not sure which situations they should be used in, or whether you pronounce  them correctly, but practice is the best way to understand that. It is not enough to find out the meaning of a word. You should hammer   it into your mind by using it in actual conversations in everyday life. Also, it may be helpful to know the meaning of the word roots, prefixes   and suffixes  , especially if they have a Greek or Latin origin . Even if you meet a long unfamiliar word, it will be easy to know its meaning if you know the general meaning of its parts.  For example, if you see the word \"philanthropy\", it won't be difficult to _ what it means if you know that \"anthropo\" means \"human\" and \"philo\" means \"loving\". Not only can ancient Greek and Latin be helpful, but a number of modern languages as well. So, if you speak French,  Italian, Spanish or Portuguese, guess the meaning of an unfamiliar English word if it sounds like  a word from another language you know. what's the writer's purpose in writing the passage?", "subject": ""}

Many parts of the old machines are reused, and only the parts that can't be used are thrown away. The government also charges  a rubbish bag tax . If people want their rubbish to be collected, they must buy yellow stickers  and put them on their rubbish bags. In 2003, 47% of all rubbish in the cities was recycled. This included 70% of paper, 95%of glass, 71%of plastic bottles and 85--90%of cans. Until recently, people could get a small amount of money when they recycled their bottles.

The person can pass messages between your family members. Then, get a family disaster _ ready. It should include things your family needs. It can help you survive   at least for three days like bread, water, medicine and things like that. Put them in a bag so you can carry it if you leave in a hurry. When doing it, remember that different people have different needs.  Include special things necessary for elderly or young members of your family. Finally, practice your emergency plan, and update   it as necessary. You may not be able to stop disasters, but with a little planning you can be helped.

Immediately the master shouted, \"John, leave the hall and there will be no orange for you this year.\" John's heart broke violently wide open. He turned and went quickly back to the cold room. Then he heard the door open and each of the children entered. Little Elizabeth with her hair falling over her shoulders, a smile on her face, and tears in her eyes held out a piece of rag to John. \"Here John,\" she said, \"this is for you.\" As he lifted back the edges of the rag he saw a big juicy orange all peeled and quartered  and then he realized what they had done. John never forgot the sharing, love and personal sacrifice  his friends had shown him that Christmas day. In memory of that day every year he would send oranges all over the world to children everywhere. What can be inferred from the text?", "subject": ""}

People believe that the characteristics of a zodiac animal influence the personality of every person born in that year.

When people think it is not proper to ask: \"How old are you\", they may change their question to \"What is your zodiac animal?\" With this question, you can figure out roughly which year someone was born and the person's age. Zodiac animals are not special to China. Many countries share a similar zodiac culture with China. For example, in the Japanese Zodiac, a wild boar takes the place of a pig and the Vietnamese zodiac has a cat instead of a rabbit.

It gave me time to write some postcards to send back home. Amsterdam is a fun city, full of friendly locals and many tourists. I spent the whole day visiting the art museums here. The museum about the famous Dutch artist Van Gogh is filled with history and beautiful art. I took a boat ride and saw local people in traditional dress. I even got to taste some delicious Dutch cheese. Copenhagen, Denmark, is one of the safest places in the world. I spent a busy and nice day at the Tivoli Amusement Park.
