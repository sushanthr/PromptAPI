Which country drinks the most tea? It's neither China nor Japan. It's Great Britain. In the wild, tea plants may be 30 feet tall. But a plant grown for market is pruned. Pruning keeps the plant only three or four feet tall. This is an easy height for tea picking. Only the two top leaves and bud of each new shoot are picked.

But Australian researchers have found a way to make something like this possible! A team at RMIT University in Melbourne, Australia, found a way to put special nanostructures   into clothing, which can then clean the clothes. When sunlight hits the nanostructures, they break down the dirt and stains   that don't belong on your clothes. The nanostructures don't break down the actual clothing because cotton and the other clothing materials are too strong to be broken down. According to CNN, the researchers cover the clothing in a solution made of silver and copper   nanostructures. All it takes is 40 minutes of sunlight and your clothes will look as good as new. So if you spill on yourself during lunch, you can step outside for a walk, and it will be clean by the time you go inside. It not only makes your life easier, but it can also be good for the environment.

I was born and raised there and now I visit it from time to time. My family moved to the city, so I only go back to see friends or to camp and fish. I grew up in a small town called Antonito Co. It is surrounded by mountains. So camping is a big source of happiness in the valley. There are so many beautiful places to hike. The town itself is very small. It is said that if you blink   when you're going through it, you'll miss it. This has some truth in it considering the size of the town. We have one grocery store  , a tiny post office , and a tiny bank. There are also a few gas stations, bars, some excellent restaurants, a small hospital and of course several schools. However, for clothing and shoes, you have to drive thirty miles to Alamosa to shop there. Everyone in the town is nice and we all know each other. The crime rate   is zero unless you count some weekend fights that break out because some people drink too much. The classes in school are small, so you get a lot of attention from the teacher. You're probably wondering why I don't live there. Well, I can't get a job there. A lot of the businesses are family-owned. And they never fire  their employees. So the employees work there usually until they retire . Most people have to go to other places to get a job. Which is the following statements is TRUE?", "subject": ""}

We stayed in a castle in Dublin for two days, where my ancestors  came from. The town we thought we might be bored in was Kilkenny, but we loved every minute we were there. There were so many places to explore and the pictures we took were beautiful. It was so exciting to see the little village of Cobh and know it was the last stop for the Titanic(a famous ship) at that time. We loved the visitor centre there and the little shops. We never got any bad food there. It was so mouth-watering at every stop! And when we stayed in Westmeath, we saw the Trim Castle through the windows and found some scenes from Brave Heart which was filmed there. We were so excited. Again, more beautiful pictures were taken in that tiny town. We love the country, the people, the food and the magic. We would go back very soon.

{"answer": 1, "choices": ["Sarah.", "Gareth.", "Lindsay.", "Warren."], "question": "A proverb is a simple saying that explains a general rule or feeling. Four people share their favorites: Sarah /England My favorite proverb would have to be \"Don't judge   a book by its' cover.\" I think it can be used in many daily situations. Obviously, when you meet new people, you always need to give someone a chance. So, I think that a chance is always good for someone, probably better than judging on first impressions  . Gareth / England My favorite proverb is \"Hear and I forget; see and I understand; I do and I know.\" I like it because it means until you actually do something, it's hard to really, truly know it. I believe that a lot of the times when you're learning by hearing, it's very difficult to get that knowledge. When you see something, it gets a little bit better, but when you do something, that's when you really truly know something. Lindsay / United States I really like the proverb, \"The grass is always greener on the other side.\" I think that's really true, and I find that it's always like that. I always want what I can't have, and then when I get that, then I find out that it's not as great as I had hoped it would be. So, because of this, I try to always keep that in mind and be happy for what I have. Warren / Canada I think \"What goes around, comes around \" is what comes to mind for me. I think it is really true. Basically, if you do something good, good things will happen to you. And if you do bad things, bad things are going to happen to you, maybe not right away but after a long time. Who thinks it is important to learn by doing?", "subject": ""}

{"answer": 1, "choices": ["Different Kinds of Music", "The Beginning of Rock and Roll", "Elvis's Contribution  to Music", "Rock and Roll Is Developing"], "question": "It is difficult to say exactly how the music we call \"rock\" or \"rock and roll\" began. Its roots   go back to many different countries and many different kinds of music and many musicians. Rock music developed mainly from the interaction  of black African and white European music. The Europeans and the African slaves  who came to America during the seventeenth century each had their own different kinds of music. Black Africans used heavy drumbeats,a rough singing voice,and the calling of a melody  and answer of a chorus. The white Europeans,mostly English and Scots,used a stronger melody,a less heavy beat,and instruments such as guitars,horns,and fiddles. The history of rock and roll is the history of how rock changed from these two traditions. From the seventeenth to the twentieth century, musicians in the southern United States developed two new forms of music: the blues,usually played by blacks,and country music, played by whites. Black musicians sang the blues with a guitar. This music was similar to work songs:stories of troubles and pain, with lines that were repeated several times. The word \"rock and roll\" probably came from the black churches in the South, where people sang and danced to the strong rhythms, which they called \"rocking and reeling\". At the same time, whites were playing country music, which was mostly traditional dancing music and slow songs that told sad stories. The singers played with string instruments such as fiddles and guitars. During this time blues and country musicians had some influence on each other, but the influence grew stronger after phonograph records  became popular in the late nineteenth century. The birth of the electric guitar changed country and blue music in the 1940s. The sound of the electric guitar would become the sound, of rock and roll.

{"answer": 3, "choices": ["Supermarkets should recycle first.", "Packaging causes serious problems.", "Needless things are mostly recycled.", "Recycling should be done in the first place."], "question": "Ask someone what they have done to help the environment recently and they will almost mention recycling, which is the process   of treating used things, such as paper or steel so that they can be used again. Recycling in the home is very important of course. However, being forced to recycle often means we already have more things than we need. We are now dealing with the results of that _ in the possible greenest way, but it would be far better if we did not bring so many things home in the first place. Here is an example. In the UK, the total of packaging increased by 12% between 1999 and 2005. It now makes up a third of a household's waste. In many supermarkets, foods are packaged twice with plastic and cardboard. Too much packaging causes serious environmental problems. The UK is running out of different kinds of ways for dealing with this unnecessary waste. If such packaging is burnt, it gives off greenhouse gases which go on to cause the greenhouse effect  . Recycling helps, but the process itself uses energy. The best way of avoiding this problem is to stop producing such unnecessary things in the first place. Food waste is another serious problem, too. Too many supermarkets encourage customers   to buy more than they need. They seldom encourage customers to reuse their plastic bags, for example. However, a few of them are coming round to the idea that this cannot continue. But this is not just about supermarkets. It is about all of us. We have learned to connect packaging with quality  . We have learned to think that something unpackaged is of poor quality. Is it true for all the products? In fact, more and more companies realized the importance of protecting the environment. They try to package what really should be packaged, including products in good quality. As more of us recycle, we are beginning to realize how many unnecessary things are being collected. We need to face the waste of our daily life. Although many people have taken action to recycle, we have a high mountain to climb. What does the passage mainly talk about?", "subject": ""}

On the other hand, a growing number of people hope to use their cars to show off . What's more, years of research has shown that one of other reasons for the traffic jam is the driving habit. For example, many young people enjoy driving very fast, so they can feel excited. At last, most of them hardly care about the speed  rules. Many governments  are working at how to make the traffic better. In my opinion, firstly, the government should educate  those people who have cars or plan to buy cars. The governments must make them know that the traffic jam is very serious , and set up a much more perfect traffic system  to solve the traffic pressure.

There was a smaller earthquake (around 4.7) that happened around 4 am and neither my wife nor I could get back to sleep. When the big earthquake hit, my wife was using her computer while our younger son Norbu (18 months old) was playing in the living room. Tsering, our older son who is 3 years old, was still asleep in the back bedroom of the 3 bedroom apartment we were living in. Norbu flew across the room when the earthquake hit. My wife was also thrown to the ground. Everything in our apartment began to be tossed   around, breaking when it hit the walls or floor. I ran to the back bedroom and grabbed   Tsering as my wife grabbed Norbu off the floor. Together, we ran to the door. I stopped long enough to grab my shoes, coat and a bit of money. I opened the door and one of our neighbors helped us carry Tsering down to the ground floor. I was the only one of my family who managed to get shoes. After the earthquake, we were able to see that this was a major earthquake. We began to hear people crying for help, badly injured people crawling   to the road and people weeping   for loved ones who had died. Which is the best title for this article?", "subject": ""}

He was born in France in 1828. His father wanted him to become a lawyer , but when he was about twenty years old, Verne decided to become a writer. At first he wrote plays for the theater. Then, in 1863, he wrote a story called Five Weeks in a Balloon. The success of this book encouraged him to write more stories such as A Journey to the Center of the Earth(1864) and From the Earth to the Moon(1865). In the 19th century, many people were interested in science and inventions. Jules Verne wrote about scientific subjects in his stories and, as a result, they were very popular. Verne's writing included many predictions  for the 20th century and many of them came true. He described space flight, movies, and air conditioning, a long time before they appeared. These books were very successful and they made Verne rich. Jules Verne's books have been the subjects for many movies. 20,000 Leagues Under the Sea was a successful movie for Walt Disney.

{"answer": 3, "choices": ["Venezuela and Indonesia.", "Ivory Coast and Ghana.", "Indonesia and China.", "China and India."], "question": "Most of us probably live without vegetables, but a world without chocolate? Now that would be hard! According to chocolate makers it could happen if we don't act soon. There are two main causes of the chocolate shortage --- chocolate's growing popularity and less production of cocoa, the plant from which chocolate is made. With more and more people in India and China loving chocolate, not much can be done about the first cause. Therefore, the only thing we can do is to increase cocoa production. However, new plant diseases and little rain in Ivory Coast and Ghana, the world's largest producers, have reduced cocoa production by 40 percent in the past 10 years. What's worse, many cocoa farmers in Africa and other cocoa-producing countries like Indonesia and Venezuela are changing to easier-to-grow crops such as corn or rubber. This way, the farmers can make more money. To prevent more farmers from changing, researchers at the newly opened International Cocoa Control Centre, in the UK, are trying to create new cocoa plants that are stronger and faster growing. But first they must make sure the new plants are safe to grow. This takes a long time. First, each new plant is stored at the Control Centre for six months to make sure it is healthy. It is then planted in the Centre's fields, studied and tested for another two years. Only after scientists are certain that they're disease-free, will the plants be sent to farmers in West Africa or wherever else they are needed. To create new stronger types of cocoa, scientists at the Centre are combining the best parts from different cocoa plants. Though the world is facing a serious chocolate shortage, there is now hope!

But in the future, most things in your home may be connected, thanks to the so-called \"Internet of things\". The Internet of things may be coming sooner than you think. Earlier this year, Samsung CEO spent a lot of time talking about the Internet things. He said that four years from now, every Samsung product will be part of the Internet of things, no matter whether it's a remote control or a washing machine. So, how do household objects that are part of the Internet of things work? Well, think of a common chair. When connected to the Internet, the chair warms up when it knows the user has just walked into the room and is feeling cold. An Internet-connected camera could help people feel safer in their homes. It can know people's faces and has an infrared sensor , so even if it's dark it can see when someone passes by and send you a message on your smartphone to let you know who's there. If the person is someone you don't know, it can tell you that, too. But according to MIT Technology Review, whether companies are connecting dog food bowls or security systems to the Internet, there may be some problems. For example, many early connected-home objects don't have much built-in security, which means they could be hacked. Moreover, it could be difficult to get these new machines to work together especially when they are made by different companies. To fight this, many companies have joined the Open Interconnect Consortium, which had 45 members by late 2015. So, picture this: you enter your home.The temperature changes to make you feel comfortable. Your favorite music starts playing for you. Do you think that this would be a good thing?

The pub's name, The Old Swan, was on the wall. Next to the name was a wooden ship's wheel and in the middle of the wheel was the name of a ship, HMS Swan. The wheel was old, Earl could tell. The next morning, Earl asked to see Tony Thatcher. The Old Swan was Tony's pub. He took Earl to his office while Candy had a coffee outside by the river. Earl said he could give Tony a lot of money for the ship's wheel. He told Tony that Benjamin Cooper, his grandfather, went to America on the ship HMS Swan. But Tony said no at first. After all, the wheel was very old and it was part of the pub's past. \"You can think of the past, Mr. Thatcher - can I call you Tony? - or you can think of today. And with the money, Tony, you can buy a good car. Maybe a new Jaguar? And, as I've told you, the wheel is part of my family's past too. So you could say it's going back home, in a way. So, what do you say?\" A month later, Earl and Candy were smiling as they looked at the wall of their house in Houston, Texas. Earl thought to himself that, at last, he had a piece of his family's past. He was happy. In Portsmouth, Tony Thatcher was happy, too. He was putting his new Jaguar into his large garage . He was careful not to drive into any of the six ship's wheels in the garage. A friend of his made the wheels for him. They were just like the one that Earl bought. And there was another wheel on the outside wall of The Old Swan now. Old or new - Tony thought there was no way that a tourist could ever know which was which. Never in a hundred years.

In one hand was a plastic phone, in the other a toy broom. I listened as she was speaking to her imaginary friend and I'll never forget the words she said, even though it was pretend . She said, \"Suzie's in the corner because she's not been very good. She didn't listen to a word I said or do the things she should.\" In the corner I saw her baby doll all dressed in lace and pink. It was obvious she'd been put there to sit alone and think. My daughter continued her \"conversation,\"  as I sat down on the floor. She said, \"I'm all fed up, I just don't know what to do with her anymore. She cries whenever I have to work and wants to play games, too. She never lets me do the things that I just have to do. She tries to help me with the dishes, but her arms just cannot reach and she doesn't know how to fold towels. I don't have the energy to teach. I have a lot of work to do and a big house to keep clean. I don't have the time to sit and play. Don't you know what I mean?\" And that day I thought a lot about making some changes in my life, as I listened to her innocent  words that cut me like a knife. I hadn't been paying enough attention to what I hold most dear.

{"answer": 1, "choices": ["Mr. King.", "Bob Watson.", "Regent Brand.", "Mrs. Watson."], "question": "Dear Mr. King, Your supermarket chain is excellent in many ways. I enjoy the things you sell, such as the selection of produce   and fresh bakery items. I have been a long time supermarket shopper and hope to continue for many years. I have found, however, that I must make a separate shopping trip to one of your competitors because there are many items your store does not carry. This becomes inconvenient for me, as my time is valuable, and I do not like to make two trips. Your low prices and excellent customer service keep me coming back to your supermarket, but I would be a more satisfied customer if I could find all the items I need in one place. To tell the truth, I have never been able to purchase nacho   cheese soup at your store. I can find other flavors   of soup, but your store does not carry nacho cheese soup, a common ingredient   in many of my recipes. In addition, I can only find large wonton wrappers  , while many other stores carry both large and small and offer a more varied selection for their customers. Another example is Regent Brand Chili Seasoning. Though it is not a leading brand, it is still common on the shelves of other grocery stores in this area and is superior in flavor to its competitors. I sincerely hope to continue a relationship with your store, and I hope that you will consider the possibility of expanding your goods to be more competitive. Yours truly, Bob Watson According to the passage, who often buy things in the supermarket?", "subject": ""}
