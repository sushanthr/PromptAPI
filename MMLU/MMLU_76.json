All the jobs I've had at the fort have been really fun.\" Fort Delaware is a living-history museum that shows how life was in frontier America in the mid-1700s. \"Reading about history can't compare to experiencing it for yourself,\" says Alice. The experience begins as soon as visitors enter the fort. The smell of wood smoke fills the air. Women in petticoats (long skirts) and men in knee breeches(knee-length shorts) are busy with their chores. The guides show visitors how the settles would have carried out everyday work. \"Kids are surprised when I tell them that one of their jobs would have been to make candles,\" says another guide, 16-year-old Jane. \"They don't realize that kids back then had to work hard.\" She also shows visitors how to play with toys and games. They are playing historical parts, so the guides can't wear shorts or T-shirts when the weather is hot. But the clothes of the past can easily change modern kids into people from 18th century. \"The clothing felt strange at first, but it does make it easier to get into characters,\" says Jane. Working at the fort has helped Jane to appreciate her life even more. Alice agrees, \"The fort has taught me how hard life was and how much work there was every day. We are so lucky with everything we have now. Life wasn't always this easy.\" ,. (5,2,10) Which of the following is TRUE about the life in frontier America in the mid-1700s?", "subject": ""}

{"answer": 2, "choices": ["Two.", "Three.", "Four.", "Five."], "question": "Text messaging, or simply \"texting\", which allows people to send and receive messages on  mobile phones, becomes very popular today. The advantages of texting are obvious. Texting helps to save money. If you have a few words to greet your families and friends on their birthdays or on some important festivals, sending messages can be cheaper than phone calling. Texting helps to save time. Even if you want to send a message to 100 people, you can do it one second. Texting helps you to \"talk\" to someone when he is too busy to answer the phone. Texting can also help you to \"talk\" to someone secretly if you don't want others to hear what you are talking on the phone. These advantages are so amazing that many people are crazy about it. They hold mobile phones in hands all day long, send dozens of messages each day, and even text while driving or walking. However, texting has its disadvantages. Junk messages may come into your mobile phone box now and then. When your phone box gets too full, you can't receive any more messages. You may therefore miss some important information. What's more, if you don't do texting properly, for example texting while driving or walking, it can be dangerous. It can cause injuries and even death. It was reported that about 6,000 people were killed and half a million were injured for this reason each year. In Fort Lee, a small town in New Jersey, USA, three people died because they walked into traffic while texting in 2011. Two researchers at Stony Brook University, New York found that texters are 60% more probably to have an accident than others. When people are texting, they don't notice other people or things around them. To reduce traffic accidents, all drivers of the UN are now not allowed to text while driving. About 32 countries have passed laws _ the use of mobile phones while driving. Texting is a wonderful way of communication. However, only when we use it properly, can we fully enjoy the fun it brings.

They are killers. Unlike most bees which will sting   you only if they are disturbed  , tree-bees will attack you in thousands for no reason. And they will chase   you for your life. Walking along a dusty road while I was on holiday there last year. I found myself, without the least warning, the centre of such an attack. The air above me suddenly became thick with bees. Though it was hot, I went cold all over. Until then I had never heard of Indian tree-bees, but I had recently seen a film called \"The Angry Swarm\", which was about killer-bees. I began running to the village about half a mile away, but I was soon covered from head to foot with bees. I drove them away with my hands, only to make room for others. Each time I opened my mouth for breath, more bees entered my mouth, until it was stung to twice its usual size and I could hardly breathe. When I reached the village, I found some workers building a house. I ran towards them for help. But as soon as the workers saw the bees with me, they ran for safety at top speed. Soon my eyes had completely closed. I fell into a pile of brick dust. I pushed myself wildly down into it until my head and shoulders were covered. And then I tried hard to get out of the dust, the angry bees made a new attack on me. I was tired out and ran weakly about in circles. Soon I lost my consciousness  . Later I learned that two quick-minded villagers ran to a pile of dry grass and quickly surrounded   me with a thick wall of fire and smoke until the bees were driven away. They stayed with me, taking stings out of my body for the next three hours until a doctor came and gave me further treatment.

A food mile is the distance that food travels from the farmer's field to the person who buys the food.Nowadays, food often travels thousands of miles to get to the consumer  .Why is this, and what are the effects   of these long distances? Traditionally, farmers sold their food in the local market so the food didn't have to travel very far.The consumers also did not travel very far, because they went to their local market to buy the food.This was a good system for farmers and consumers.However, there were some disadvantages.For example, consumers could only buy food that farmers produced locally.In addition, they could only get food that was in season.Now, because of modern technology, food comes from all over the world.We do not have to wait for spring or summer to buy strawberries or tomatoes.They are _ in winter if we want. Some countries have to import  most of their food.This is because they have difficult climates.The United Arab Emirates(UAE), for example, gets 85% of its food from other countries.Even food made in the UAE often uses imported materials.

{"answer": 3, "choices": ["Lonely and sad.", "Bored and homesick.", "Angry and impatient.", "Happy and excited."], "question": "We may know that there are four basic stages that human beings pass through when they enter and live in a new culture. This process, which helps us to deal with culture shock , is the way our head and our personality react to(...) the strange new things we meet with when we move from one culture to another. Culture begins with the \"honeymoon stage\". This is the time when we first arrive in which everything about the new culture is strange and exciting. We see new things, hear new sounds and language, eat new kinds of food. This stage can last for quite a long time because we feel we are very excited. Unluckily, the second stage can be more difficult. After we have got used to our new life, we can become very tired and begin to miss our homeland and our family, friends, pets. All the little problems in life seem to be much bigger and more disturbing when you face them in a foreign culture. This time of cultural adjustment  can be very difficult and lead to pulling away from the new culture. The third stage is called the \"adjustment stage\". This is when you begin to realize that things are not so bad in the host culture. Your sense of humor usually becomes stronger and you realize that you are becoming stronger by learning to take care of yourself in the new place. Things are still difficult, but you are now a survivor! The fourth stage can be called \"at ease at last\". Now you feel quite comfortable in your new place. You can deal with most problems that you have. You may still have problems with the language, but you know you are strong enough to deal with them. There is a fifth stage of culture shock which many people don't know about. This is called \"reverse culture shock\". Surprisingly, this happens when you go back to your own culture and find that you have changed and that things there have changed while you have been away. Now you feel a little uncomfortable back home. Life is a struggle! How do you feel during the first stage of culture shock?", "subject": ""}

That meant that the country's one-child policy came to an end. To control the population growth, China started a policy of one child per couple in the 1970s. Why does China decide to relax the policy now? In fact, China began relaxing the policy in January, 2014, allowing couples to have a second baby if the mother or father was an only child. The change was thought as a major liberalization   of the  family planning of over thirty years. But new figures   in January, 2015 suggested that fewer people than expected would like to have a second baby. Health officials said that there were about 11 million couples  under the new policy. However, only 1 million couples applied   to have a second child. Some couples said, \"Two kids? Thanks but no.\" The influence of one-child policy seems hard to go in a short time.

After a few minutes there is a very weak light in the east, and then I hear a bird singing. It sings very loud and very clear. \"That's the robin ,\" says Jim. A few more birds start singing with the robin and Jim knows the names of them too. Half an hour later, there are more and more birds singing, and it's very loud! Suddenly, all around us the air is full of the sound of birdsong. This is the dawn chorus , and it's beautiful. \"Wow, this is amazing!\" I tell Jim, who is smiling. \"Is there a dawn chorus every morning?\" \"Birds can sing any time of the year but the best time is the end of winter and during the spring. This is when the birds sing most.\" \"Really? So, why do they sing?\" I ask. \"Well, there are two reasons,\" explains Jim. \"Most of the songbirds who sing are males. They want to find a female so they sing to show how strong they are. The females listen and choose the best singer! The birds also sing to tell other males to go away. They need their own area; they don't like sharing with another male.\" I listen to the birds; the songs seem too much to me. \"Do the birds sing a special song in the morning?\" \"That's a good question,\" replied Jim. \"The successful birds have many kinds of calls and songs. Sometimes they copy the songs of other birds. This makes it sound like there are many birds in that place already and other males stay away. Also the female likes songs with different notes. Some birds, for example the European wren, have songs that contain over 700 different notes per minute!\" So, how does Jim know so much about birds? Well, he works as a volunteer for the Royal Society for the Protection of Birds. He is trying to help the birds live in the modern world. \"More and more of the birds' habitat disappears every year. The sparrow, for example, was a very common bird in the UK, now it's in danger.\" By now the sun is up and the birds are quiet. It's light so they can start looking for food, they need a big breakfast after all that singing. Why does the writer get up early in the morning?", "subject": ""}

A few more birds start singing with the robin and Jim knows the names of them too. Half an hour later, there are more and more birds singing, and it's very loud!

They want to find a female so they sing to show how strong they are. The females listen and choose the best singer! The birds also sing to tell other males to go away. They need their own area; they don't like sharing with another male.\" I listen to the birds; the songs seem too much to me. \"Do the birds sing a special song in the morning?\" \"That's a good question,\" replied Jim. \"The successful birds have many kinds of calls and songs. Sometimes they copy the songs of other birds. This makes it sound like there are many birds in that place already and other males stay away. Also the female likes songs with different notes. Some birds, for example the European wren, have songs that contain over 700 different notes per minute!\" So, how does Jim know so much about birds? Well, he works as a volunteer for the Royal Society for the Protection of Birds. He is trying to help the birds live in the modern world. \"More and more of the birds' habitat disappears every year.

Many of them are Hollywood film stars, and they often come to the parties there. At Hearst Castle, there are also beautiful gardens and two swimming pools, one inside and a larger one outside. I loved the one outside, the \"Neptune Pool\". It was a pity that we couldn't go swimming there! The guide told us that Mr. Hearst travelled around Europe with his mother at the age of ten and looked at paintings and castles. He never forgot that tour and wanted his house to look like a castle. When Mr Hearst died in 1951, his family gave Hearst Castle to the people of California. Now it's a museum. Which of the following sentences is TRUE?", "subject": ""}

While a widespread vocabulary is advantageous to a constructed language, there is a key differentiator   we can see between just a lot of words and real language: Grammar. Grammar is what makes constructed languages like Elvish learnable by everyday superfans. Superfans of The Lord of the Rings have built websites and created dictionaries, apps and translators, to teach Elvish. They have also created online clubs where fans can discuss and even create new words based on the already existing vocabulary, and continue to study the language. So what does it take to be a master of Elvish? In learning Elvish, there are a couple of grammatical rules similar to those of the English language. For example, in order to make a verb past tense in English, you have to add an -ed, making wash, washed. Similarly in Elvish, in order to change the word for wash, which is allu, to the past tense then you have to add an -ne to the word. So washed is then translated to allune in past tense. Nouns in Elvish are different in the way that the noun changes depending on how it's used in a sentence, just like in Latin or Russian. For example, the word head in Elvish is CAS.

Similarly in Elvish, in order to change the word for wash, which is allu, to the past tense then you have to add an -ne to the word. So washed is then translated to allune in past tense. Nouns in Elvish are different in the way that the noun changes depending on how it's used in a sentence, just like in Latin or Russian. For example, the word head in Elvish is CAS. However, if you duck your head, then the word changes to CARA. When mentioning something in your head, then it changes to CASSE. Tolkien's attention to detail in creating the fantasy world used in The Lord of the Rings and The Hobbit, complete with multiple functioning   invented languages, has attracted readers and movie viewers these years. Elvish is only one of the many magical languages developed by J.R.R. Tolkien. Creating language for fantasy has proven to add to viewers and readers experiences. By transplanting their imagination to a new world, fans are able to learn the new language and speak Elvish with each other, much like their favorite characters. Which of the following is TRUE about Elvish?", "subject": ""}
{"answer": 0, "choices": ["Elvish, a Magical Language", "J.R.R. Tolkien, a Great Writer", "The Hobbit, a Wonderful Film", "Language, a Way to Communicate"], "question": "As one of the most well-known of the fantasy languages invented for science fiction film, television and book, and developed by J.R.R. Tolkien himself, Elvish is made up with several thousand words and different sentence structures. Constructed languages   like Elvish are real languages, made up of thousands of words created by fantasy writers, linguists and fans, with real language rules. While a widespread vocabulary is advantageous to a constructed language, there is a key differentiator   we can see between just a lot of words and real language: Grammar. Grammar is what makes constructed languages like Elvish learnable by everyday superfans. Superfans of The Lord of the Rings have built websites and created dictionaries, apps and translators, to teach Elvish. They have also created online clubs where fans can discuss and even create new words based on the already existing vocabulary, and continue to study the language.

So seeing a tragic movie may make you sad, but that will make you to think more about your own close relationships and appreciate them more.\" The link between watching a tragic story and feeling better has long been recognized.

Some people did not like this, and chose to keep April 1 as New Year's Day. Many called these people 'April fools' and played jokes and tricks on them. Over time, April 1 became a day to have fun in France. It then spread to England and Scotland, and later, to North America. On April Fool's Day, jokes are common. In the United States, for example, a person may move a friend's clock ahead one hour, or change the sugar and salt. In Scotland, April Fool's Day lasts for two days. The second day is called 'Taily Day'-for one's 'tail'. On this day, people might secretly put a sign saying 'kick me' on a person's back or behind. Other countries have their own 'Fool's Day'.

But a new camera made by a French company can recognize   faces. It can tell parents at work that their children have returned from school, or that the mail has been sent to their home. It can also tell them if a stranger has entered their home. When family members enter a home, the smart camera \"recognizes\" them and sends information to the owner's phone. The owner can choose to see the video then or later. But if an unknown person enters a home, the camera will send a warning sound on the owner's phone. This is what happened recently to a smart home camera owner named Damien. He lives in Paris. \"On a Friday I was at work, having a big monthly meeting when my phone moved. At first I told myself 'Oh, it must be a wrong warn,' but my phone was telling me there was a face that the camera did not recognize. Something was happening in my house!\" \"I saw a person I did not know with his shoes on, which is not allowed in my apartment  . I watched it on the video. I felt quite surprised. I hurried back home as fast as possible and called the police on the way. Thanks to the smart camera, the criminal was caught soon,\" said Damien.

Some eye doctors say this leads to an increase in \"computer vision syndrome .\" Nathan Bonilla-Warford is an optometrist in Tampa, Florida. He has seen an increase in problems in children. \"A lot more children come into the office either because their parents have noticed that they have headaches or red or watery eyes or discomfort, or because their nearsightedness appears to be increasing and they're worried,\" he says. Dr. Bonilla-Warford says part of the problem is that children may be more likely to pay no attention to early warning signs than adults. \"Even if their eyes start to feel uncomfortable or they start to get a headache, they're less likely to tell their parents, because they don't want to have the game or the computer or whatever taken away,\" he explains. He says another part of the problem is that people blink less often when they use digital devices. He says, \"A person who uses an electronic device blinks about one third as much as we normally do in everyday life. And so that can result in the front part of the eye drying and not staying protected like normal.\" Eye doctors offer suggestions like following which is known as the 20/20/20 rule. That means every twenty minutes look away twenty feet or more for at least twenty seconds from whatever device you're using. Other suggestions include putting more distance between you and the device and using good lighting. Of course, another way is to spend less time looking at screens. Many experts say children should spend no more than two hours a day using digital devices--with no screen time for children under two.
