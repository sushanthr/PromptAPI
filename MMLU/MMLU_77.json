Usually, these stories do not have much truth to them. One of the biggest fish stories in history was about a whale. In 1891, a ship hunting for whales in the South Atlantic Ocean found a very large whale. While the hunters were trying to kill the whale, it sank two small boats. One man drowned, and another man, James Bartley, was lost in the ocean. However, after the hunters finally killed the whale, they cut open the whale's stomach and found Mr Bartley inside. He was not dead! Several weeks later, Mr Bartley seemed to have gotten over his terrible experience. The only thing he could remember was that while he was inside the whale, it was very hot. The liquid   from the whale's stomach had turned all of his skin snow white. Mr Bartley had to live with the effect from the whale for the rest of his life. Today, many people have heard about the strange experience of Mr Bartley and do not buy it. Not one real fact has been found to prove that the events ever took place described by the sailors. No scientist or newspaper reporter was ever able to talk to Mr Bartley, and all of the stories told in magazines about Mr Bartley's experience were explained by other sailors on the boat. Mr Bartley was probably not even a real person at all. In 1928, after the captain   of the whaling ship had died, one man asked the captain's wife about Mr Bartley's story.

They couldn't find work in Britain because they spoke little English. The whole family had to live on benefits  and they lived in a small house in Hackney, a poor area in East London. Growing up is not easy for Michael, but he never gave up. At the age of ten, he set his heart on going to Cambridge University. It was not easy, either. Michael studied at a school, which used to be called \"the worst school in Britain\". However, young Michael made his mind to try his best, no matter what kind of school he was studying at. The smart boy studied very hard and did well in every subject at school. Once he made a bet with his friend to learn further math. As a result, after just spending four months teaching himself from a textbook, he got an A in AS-level further math.

In an unusual competition, the Government will ask people to find out the greatest challenge  today, such as finding a replacement  for oil, producing low cost food or curing AIDS/HIV. When the toughest problem has been decided, the Prime Minister will give away PS1,000,000 to the person who successfully works out the answer. The competition follows the example of the Longitude Prize started by the government in 1714, which offered PS20,000 (worth PS6,000,000 today) to anyone who could discover how far east or west ships had sailed. Sailors could work out their location north and south, and were able to decide their local time from the sun. However, they needed to know the time at a reference  point in order to find out how far they had travelled east or west. Many people thought the problem was impossible to solve, but the prize was finally won by John Harrison, an ordinary worker. He did this by designing a clock that kept accurate  time at sea and made it possible for sailors to work out their location.

So, just what is the right form of words to express your thanks? Luckily, the answer is in the language itself. \"Cheers\" is considered an informal way to say thank you. For example, when going for a drink with friends, a smile and a \"cheers\" by way of thanks is not only acceptable to the situation, it is also culturally _ . \"Ta\" was the second-most popular expression of thanks, and is also commonly used in informal situations, along with phrases such as \"nice one\", and \"wonderful\". Interestingly, one word that didn't make it into the top 20 was \"thanks\". But \"thanks\" can be useful, as it is able to bridge the divide between \"thank you\" and the downright relaxed \"cheers\". Certain words can double as an expression of thanks as well as delight. For example, words like \"awesome\", \"brilliant\" and \"you star\" can tell both your pleasure at someone's action, as well as serving to express your thanks. If you are on the receiving end of a \"new\" thank you, you can reply with a simple \"no problem\", or \"sure\". Of course, a simple wave, nod or smile may be all right. For example, if a car driver slows down to let you cross the road, simply raising your hand is enough to show that you are thankful for the driver's consideration. Sometimes, formality is necessary, and \"thank you\" is still the best choice in such situations. But students should not worry about when exactly to use certain expressions. Many people in western countries are worried that good manners are in decline  . People are tired of seeing their acts of kindness and service pass without any feedback.

{"answer": 2, "choices": ["during a storm", "when it is sunny", "on a very hot day", "when you take in an exam"], "question": "Weather has a strong effect  on people. It influences health, intelligence   and feelings. In August, it is very hot and wet in the southern part of the United States. People there easily have heart trouble and other kinds of health problems during this month. In the Northeast and the Middle West, it is hot at some times and very cold at other times. People in those states will have heart trouble after the weather changes in February or March. The weather can also influence intelligence. For example, in a 1983 study by scientists, the IQ scores of some college students were very high during storm, but after the storm, their scores were low. Storms can increase intelligence. Very hot weather, on the other hand, can decrease  it. Students in many schools of the United States often do badly in exams in the hot months of the year(July and August). Weather also has a strong effect on people's feeling. Winter may be a bad time for thin people. They usually feel cold during these months. They might feel depressed during cold weather. In hot summer weather, on the other hand, fat people may feel unhappy. At about 65F, people become stronger. Low air pressure  makes people feel free, but it also increases forgetful- ness. People leave more bags and umbrellas on buses and in stores on low pressure days. There is a\"perfect weather\"for work and health.

It influences health, intelligence   and feelings. In August, it is very hot and wet in the southern part of the United States. People there easily have heart trouble and other kinds of health problems during this month. In the Northeast and the Middle West, it is hot at some times and very cold at other times. People in those states will have heart trouble after the weather changes in February or March. The weather can also influence intelligence. For example, in a 1983 study by scientists, the IQ scores of some college students were very high during storm, but after the storm, their scores were low. Storms can increase intelligence. Very hot weather, on the other hand, can decrease  it. Students in many schools of the United States often do badly in exams in the hot months of the year(July and August). Weather also has a strong effect on people's feeling. Winter may be a bad time for thin people. They usually feel cold during these months. They might feel depressed during cold weather. In hot summer weather, on the other hand, fat people may feel unhappy. At about 65F, people become stronger. Low air pressure  makes people feel free, but it also increases forgetful- ness. People leave more bags and umbrellas on buses and in stores on low pressure days. There is a\"perfect weather\"for work and health. People feel best at a tempera- ture of about 64F with 65 percent humidity . Are you feeling sick, sad, tired, forgetful, or very intelligent today? The weather may be the reason.

{"answer": 1, "choices": ["Choo was lucky enough when he was young.", "Choo must be thankful for Vogue magazine.", "\"Jimmy Choo\" is a brand with a long history.", "It's much harder for a man to succeed in the fashion world."], "question": "\"Face it, Andy. You sold your soul the day you put on that first pair of Jimmy Choo's.\" That line from the movie The Devil Wears Prada is an example showing how a shoemaker has become famous in the fashion world. Jimmy Choo (Zhou Yangjie) is a native Malaysian of Chinese origin  , born in 1961 into a family of shoemakers. He created his first pair of shoes at age 11. His family couldn't pay for his schooling, so he dropped out at a young age. He had to work with his father to support the family. But his dream to be a fashion designer never disappeared, so he did all he could to enter an art college and finally took up a position in the fashion world through his talent and willpower. Choo graduated from a college in London and had a small workshop there. He hit the international fashion scene when Vogue magazine described his designs in eight pages in 1988. His work was immediately popular and got love and support from Diana, Princess of Wales. Jimmy Choo shoes are known for their very high heels   and pointed toes. However, he does some flats and lower-heeled shoes for other women. Choo co-founded Jimmy Choo Ltd. with Tamara Mellon, UK Vogue editor, but left the company in 2001. Jimmy Choo shops have opened around the world, so his designs are _ to those who want a designer shoe, and can afford his prices. Choo also has a website where shoppers can view his ready-to-wear designs. The brand   of Jimmy Choo has been comparable to top brands, like Channel, LV, etc. But it's still young and has a bright future. We can't imagine how hard it is for Choo to stand out in the worldwide fashion! He must have made greater efforts and had more difficulties than others. And so he did. So stop complaining about why good luck isn't always falling on you and devote yourselves to your work now. What can we learn from the passage?", "subject": ""}

I remember when I was a child my father always got up very early, quietly putting on his clothes and going off to work. To arrive in time to open his tiny store at 8:30, he needed to leave our apartment at 6:30. After all, he had to take a bus and then the subway. The last journey was a long walk through a neighborhood much of which was full of the smell of rubbish. I learned: it is very important to work. No excuse. When I was 12, I would, on some Saturdays, go to my father's store to help out. After helping set up the outside clothing display, for the rest of the day, I'd watch to make sure no one stole anything. When I noticed someone looking unusual or strange, I would look the person in the eye, smile and say, \"May I help you?\" Usually that worked, but sometimes, someone would run off with something. The first time, I ran after the thief but my father shouted, \"Martin, stop! There is no need to do that.\" It's true that safety is more important than money. After 10 years of hard work, he saved up enough money to buy his first car, a cheap one--he wouldn't buy one until he could afford to pay for it without borrowing money.

Last winter holiday, I visited Hong Kong for the first time with my mother and her workmates. Before we went through the entrance of the Customs and Excise Department (,CED), we had to wait for more than four hours there. All the passengers must show their permits   to the workers at the CED one by one. So there were a large number of people waiting in lines at the entrance hall. It took us a long time to walk along the metal pipes which divided the big hall into many different parts. So the entrance hall looked like a huge puzzle. Everyone should finish walking through the puzzle if they wanted to pass the entrance. I waited patiently and walked slowly after others. I just could see the back of their heads. It was difficult for me to breathe because too many people were there. At last I passed it but I was too tired to say a word. Last month I visited Hong Kong again. But this time I didn't spend much time waiting at the entrance of the CED because I got an Electronic Exit Permit with an \"Electronic Brain\" in it. When I passed the port of Hong Kong, I just needed to use it to touch the button at the entrance. It can save much time for people. I plan to visit Hong Kong again sometime in the future.

Until recently, few people took the saying very seriously. Now however, doctors have begun to study laughter and the effects   it has on the human body. They have found evidence that laughter really can improve people's health. Tests were carried out to study the effects of laughter on the body. People watched funny films while doctors checked their heart rate, blood pressure, breathing and muscles. It was found that laughter has similar effects to physical exercise. It increases blood pressure, the heart rate and the rate of breathing. It also works several groups of muscles in the face, the stomach and even the feet. If laughter exercises the body, it must be helpful. Other tests have shown that laughter appears to make the effect of pain on the body less. In one experiment doctors produced pain in groups of students who listened to different radio programs. The group which could bear the pain for the longest time was the group which listened to a funny program. The reason why laughter can make pain less seems to be that it helps to produce endorphins   in the brain. These are natural chemicals which make both stress and pain less. There is also some evidence to suggest that laughter helps the body's immune system that is the system which fights infection  . In an experiment, one group of students watched a funny video while another group served as the control group -- in other words, a group with which to compare the first group.

{"answer": 0, "choices": ["more information than television", "less information than television", "more news from other countries", "less information about important events than TV"], "question": "Some people say that today, reading is not as important as it was. These days we have photographs, films, radio and television. Why read a description of something when you can look at a photograph? Why read a newspaper when the latest news is brought to us every hour on radio and TV? Photography was certainly a wonderful invention. Photographs can give a very clear idea of places and of people that we have never seen. An encyclopedia   , for example, is always better when it has good illustrations. But we also need words to explain the photographs and drawings. A photograph of an elephant may give us a very good idea of what an elephant looks like, but it tells us nothing about the different sorts of elephants there are and where they are found, their exact size and weight, how they can be useful to man and so on. In the same way, a good film has action, movement, color, and maybe music. These are things we do not find on the printed page. But reading a novel has certain advantages over watching even an excellent feature film. Reading a novel requires imagination. Each of us imagines a story differently. Watching news on television can certainly be exciting. But we need newspapers as well. Some important news stories happen when there are no cameras around. More importantly, a newspaper does not just report the news. It explains why something has been happening. It also contains interesting articles on different subjects. Newspapers are an important part of our lives, if we want to understand what is going on in the places we live as well as in other parts of the world. Reading is very important for information and pleasure. We need to be good readers to enjoy a full life as human beings. Reading is a skill and like other skills, it needs practice.

Why read a newspaper when the latest news is brought to us every hour on radio and TV? Photography was certainly a wonderful invention. Photographs can give a very clear idea of places and of people that we have never seen. An encyclopedia   , for example, is always better when it has good illustrations. But we also need words to explain the photographs and drawings. A photograph of an elephant may give us a very good idea of what an elephant looks like, but it tells us nothing about the different sorts of elephants there are and where they are found, their exact size and weight, how they can be useful to man and so on. In the same way, a good film has action, movement, color, and maybe music. These are things we do not find on the printed page. But reading a novel has certain advantages over watching even an excellent feature film. Reading a novel requires imagination. Each of us imagines a story differently. Watching news on television can certainly be exciting. But we need newspapers as well. Some important news stories happen when there are no cameras around. More importantly, a newspaper does not just report the news. It explains why something has been happening. It also contains interesting articles on different subjects. Newspapers are an important part of our lives, if we want to understand what is going on in the places we live as well as in other parts of the world. Reading is very important for information and pleasure. We need to be good readers to enjoy a full life as human beings. Reading is a skill and like other skills, it needs practice. The more we read, the better readers we become. And the better readers we become, the more we enjoy reading! The secret is to get the reading habit. Read at least a little every day.

The result of this is not just a lot of tired people; in the United States alone, sleepy drivers cause at least 100,000 car accidents, and 1,500 deaths a year. Problems with sleep can also cause mental   problems, as well as medical problems such as high blood pressure and heart problems. American culture values work and often doesn't value sleep. In fact, people who sleep a lot are often called \"lazy\". Many famous men say proudly, \"I only have time to sleep four or five hours a night.\" Students, especially college students, often sleep only a few hours a night. They often say, \"I'm used to sleeping only a little.\" But according to experts, sleep is like money. If you sleep only five hours a day, you don't \"get used to it\", but instead, build up a \"sleep deficit  \". \"It's like a credit card (a card used to buy things or services),\" says Dr. James Maas, \"You are only borrowing time. You always have to pay it back.\" The more hours you don't sleep, the more hours you should sleep to \"pay back\" the hours on your \"sleep credit card\". For example, if you sleep four hours on Monday and then sleep eight hours on Tuesday, on Wednesday you will still have a \"sleep deficit\" of four hours. This deficit can continue for months or even years. People with a \"sleep deficit\" are sleep-deprived. Driving and making decisions can be dangerous for these people. Another research shows people should sleep nine or ten hours every night. More than half the people in the world may be running a \"sleep deficit\". You didn't do your homework last night? Maybe you can tell your teacher that you were working hard on your sleep deficit. \"Don't think you will be doing less work because you sleep during the day.
