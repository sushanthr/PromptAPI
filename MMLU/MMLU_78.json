I generally sleep poorly at night, but in the woods on a tour, I sleep like a baby with the music of insects. In the morning, birds wake me up. I eat a snack before getting up, and then I quickly pack my sleeping bag, tent, and other things and get on the road. Usually I have less speed. Traveling by bike allows me to stop anywhere, such as lakes(especially places to swim), woods, and scenic spots . Somewhere near lunch, I find a small drugstore and buy some bread, sandwich materials, and fruit. In the afternoon, my speeds are higher, and I spend less time at stops. In the late afternoon, I start thinking about stopping. I finally find a place in the early evening, cook a simple meal, and rest and cool off. As it starts to get dark, I put up my tent, and fall asleep. There are exciting times and difficult times as well. Visiting strange or famous places are always exciting to me. I meet and talk with interesting people along the way. Enjoying beautiful scenes, meeting wild animals(usually at my camping site), and traveling up and down hills also make me cheerful.

Later on, when I checked my phone, there was a message from the boss of the restaurant where we had our breakfast: \"I have something that belongs to you, and you're going to be very happy.\" We got back to the restaurant and there was the wallet on the table with all the money in it! The boss's son found the wallet in front of the door, and brought it to him. He thought that it must belong to someone who had a meal in the restaurant, so he checked inside and found my phone number on a piece of paper. Which of the following words can describe the boss best?", "subject": ""}

The bus will run on electricity and solar power, creating far less pollution than that from the cars it would be replacing  . Beijing authorities haven't decided whether to create railways for the super bus throughout the city. But they are willing to give it a test drive.

{"answer": 2, "choices": ["To please the readers.", "To encourage the readers.", "To lead in the topic of the passage.", "To support the topic of the passage."], "question": "\" To seek  happiness is to look for it\" was once said by the famous French author Jules Renard. Look for it? Sure...but don't spend a lifetime trying, especially if it's well within your reach but you're just too blind to see it. Discover the three keys to happiness that you have already understood, but that you are just too afraid to find it. 1. Accepting Yourself The idea of happiness is difficult to understand if you are not at peace with yourself. Learn to accept yourself as you are. Your next step will be to improve your attitude for tomorrow, for the next day, for the day after that, and so forth. By beginning to accept reality, you will come to the final point of true happiness. Only when you are at peace with yourself, will you finally be able to admit  that you are, in fact, a happy person. 2. Forgiving Others Forgiving others is a true show of humanity  which also allows us to feel more at ease. When you learn to forgive, you also learn to keep a firm hold on your life. To forgive is to open the doors of personal satisfaction. Yet you simply open your mind to answer, \" Do I really want to allow my anger to grow and eat me from inside out?\" 3. Helping Your Neighbors When a friend seems to be suffering from a state of depression  , it's quite easy to help him or her out of the trouble. The best attitude to have in this situation is to make him or her understand that he or she is not alone. If you come to save a friend in need, you'll feel a lot more at peace with yourself. You will feel high--spirited by knowing that someone is looking at life on the brighter side thanks to your kind words. ,.

I have two very smart daughters. My oldest is 7 and she is one of the best students in her second grade class and my youngest, who is 2, is learning new things every day. When it comes to their cleverness, I believe this is because they love reading. When my wife and I first became parents, we were told by a number of people that the best thing we could do for our kids was to encourage them to read. However, with things like television and video games out there, we found it was sometimes hard to make books seem more interesting. But, we succeeded with both of them by doing a few different things. One of the first things we did was reading to them. My youngest daughter can't read books herself yet. But, I also take the time to read to my oldest daughter, too. Not only is this a great way to _ and make them like you, it also introduces them to a world that they might not realize. One thing I recommend is making sure you plan first so you have plenty of time to read more than one book if they want it. This allows you to read their favorite stories while mixing in something new, too. Another thing I started doing with my oldest daughter is having her read to her younger sister. This makes her practice reading out loud something she gets to do at school and loves to and I've noticed my 2-year-old seems to pay closer attention to the stories for some reason. The second thing we do with our kids is we challenge them to read outside their level. I have given my oldest daughter books that are a little more complicated  .

I do the same thing when I read to my youngest daughter and will sometimes borrow one of her sister's books. So far, she's still paying attention when I read them. Third, and most important, I let them be kids and consider their interests. Reading is a great thing. But, you can get too much of a great thing, too.

If it is autumn and leaves are falling from the trees, some people try to catch the leaves as they fall because they think each leaf they catch will bring _ a lucky month in the following year--they will need to catch 12 falling leaves to have a whole of good luck!

In the age of the keyboard, some people seem to think handwriting lessons are on the way out. 90% of teachers say they are required to teach handwriting. But studies have yet to answer the question of how well they are teaching it. One of this year's studies found that about three out of every four teachers say they are not prepared to teach handwriting. Some teachers are teaching handwriting by providing instruction for 10 to 15 minutes a day, and then other teachers who basically teach it for 60 to 70 minutes a day -- which really for handwriting is pretty much. Many adults remember learning that way -- by copying letters over and over again. Today's thinking is that short periods of practice are better. Many experts  also think handwriting should not be taught by itself. Instead, they say it should be used as a way to get students to express ideas. After all, that is why we write. Handwriting involves two skills. One is _ , which means forming the letters so they can be read. The other is fluency  -- writing without having to think about it. Fluency continues to develop up until high school. But not everyone masters these skills. Teachers commonly report that about one fourth of their kids have poor handwriting. Some people might think handwriting is not important any more because of computers and voice recognition programs. But Steve Graham at Vanderbilt says word processing is seldom done in primary school, especially in the early years.

These teens have less bad diet or dangerous eating habits. \"Parents may not be able to get their family together around the table seven days a week, but if they can prepare three family meals a week, this will have a big impact on the health of teens,\" Professor Fiese spoke out after reviewing 17 studies on eating ways and nutrition  of almost 200,000 children and teenagers. She found that teens who eat at least five meals a week with their families are 35% less likely to be \"disordered eaters\". The definition  of disordered eating is eating too much, or eating at wrong times too often or eating very little and smoking to lose weight. Even three family meals a week helped, with youngsters 12% less likely to be overweight than those who ate with their family less often. Teens can also use family meals as a time to _ . They were also 24% more likely to eat healthy foods and have healthy eating habits than those who didn't share three meals with their family. Professor Fiese said, \"Family meals give them a place where they can go regularly to check in with their parents and express themselves freely.\" In the past American research found children who miss out on family meals are much more likely to fight at school, drink and take drugs . ,.

My best friend Betty had a piano. But Betty hardly played it at all. She would rather play hide-and-seek. It didn't seem fair. One day my mother came to pick me up from Betty's house. \"Watch this!\" I told her. Then I ran to play a song I had learned that morning. I was so proud of what I'd learned. \"That's nice, Jenny,\" she said. \"But we can't afford a piano.\" When I turned six, my mother bought me a recorder . The problem was that I didn't love the recorder. When I played the recorder, I didn't feel anything special inside. I asked my mother if we could have a piano. \"We still can't afford one,\" she said. \"One day, I promise.\" In the sixth grade, my mother traded in the recorder for a real clarinet . I like the clarinet more, but it still wasn't a piano. It wasn't the music that was inside of me. One day, when I was in the seventh grade, my mother cut an ad out of the newspaper. We drove to a stranger's home in Providence, Rhode Island. The woman had a beautiful, dark wood piano from Russia. It was called an upright piano because it was tall. It was so shiny that it looked like it was wet. \"We'll take it,\" my mother said. \"It has a nice sound.\" After that, I played the piano every single day.When I left for school in the morning, I would leave the sheet music open on the piano. When I got home, I would walk straight to the piano and sit down and start playing the sheet music. I even played if I stayed home sick. I had finally found the music inside of me. Do you struggle with music? Have you been given an instrument to play, but you just can't play it? Maybe you think you're just no good or that you don't have any musical talent.

You can collect stamps from letters, ask your friends to let you have their old stamps, or you can buy used stamps. When you get a letter with a stamp on it, carefully cut out the stamp. Leave lots of space around the stamp so that you will not _ it. Put the stamp in water and wait until you can safely remove the stamp. Carefully remove the stamp off the letter. Place the wet stamp between two clean pieces of paper. A stamp can get wrinkled  when it dries, so put some books on top. What does the writer think of collecting stamps?", "subject": ""}

{"answer": 3, "choices": ["Watching TV.", "Turning on a light.", "Driving a car.", "Walking to school."], "question": "The Earth has warmed by about half a degree(0.50degC)over the last 100 years. It could be getting warmer on its own, but many scientists think that people are making the Earth warmer by making a greenhouse effect. The greenhouse effect is important.  Without it, the Earth would not be warm enough for us to live on. But just a little warmer than it is now could cause problems for humans, plants and animals. Many of the things we do every day can change the Earth's temperature by sending greenhouse gases into the air. We send greenhouse gases into the air when we watch TV, turn on lights, dry hair, play video games, wash or dry our clothes or drive cars. The rubbish from factories and homes also produces greenhouse gases. Even a small change in temperature can affect our weather. This can cause changes in the sea levels, the air, flooding, and our fresh water. The change in the temperature can also cause changes in the living places for animals and plants, endangering many animals. Global warming is a big problem, and every little bit we do can help. We can save electricity. We can save energy in other ways such as by taking buses or walking rather than driving cars. We can recycle to reduce the rubbish and save natural resources such as trees, oil and metals. We can buy products that don't do bad to the environment and we can turn to solar energy.

It's about togetherness. But without the presents, there's nothing to do to fill up this long, long day. So I think Christmas is about the presents, and I'm sure you agree. If you do, I have some suggestions about ways that you could make the present part of the day last longer: using packing tape to wrap presents instead of Scotch tape . It took, like, ten minutes to open just one present. My final suggestion is pretty simple: more presents! If it took the whole day to open all of the presents, then I wouldn't have that terrible time, because my mom says it's wrong to go play video games in my room, but there's nothing else to do outside of my room.

They are exciting, amazing and can even change our lives. But have all these developments really improved the quality of our lives? Picture this.

One family in the UK went \"back in time\" to see what life was like without all the inventions we have today. The grandparents, with their daughter, and grandsons Benjamin, 10 and Thomas, 7, spent nine weeks in a 1940s house. They had no washing machine, microwave , computer or mobile phones.
