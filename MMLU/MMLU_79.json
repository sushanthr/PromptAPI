I spent about 30 minutes just trying to get out of one area. I think they need more signs posted along the trails. I like the Slender West Lake best, as she is so pretty! The ladies that were sweeping were very sweet. They always smiled at me and said hello, so it was nice. Taking a taxi is the most efficient  and quickest way to get around Yangzhou. I didn't have a problem getting to the places which I'd like to go to while using a taxi. The driver was very friendly. The fare isn't too high, either. But I didn't enjoy taking the bus. The bus ride to the Mastixia Bay   took long although I only had to pay one yuan. It was also hard finding where Bus 32 was. I tried asking some people in English but they couldn't understand me, so I had to ask in simple Chinese that I only know buy that still didn't work. I spent about one hour walking around the city to look for Bus 32. The tricycle  was nice, but it was a little too expensive for a small distance. Maybe I was _ by the guy who rode for me, but it was an enjoyable ride. I felt like I was part of the garden city more. Over all I am satisfied with Yangzhou and will recommend it to others.

Scientists first saw the lesula in June, 2007 in Congo, a country in Africa. The lesula lives in the rain forests. The monkey was first found as a pet in a local family. When researchers found it, the family told them that they caught the monkey in the wild and then kept it as a pet. The scientists have compared the lesula to the owl-faced monkey. The owl-faced monkey gets its name for having a long nose and a face that looks like an owl . The lesula and the owl-faced monkey are similar in size and both have a stripe  on their nose. This shows the lesula and the owl-faced monkeys are close relatives, but different species. Scientists say the lesula usually weighs about twelve pounds. It has long blond hair.

Boarding schools started hundreds of years ago in the country. But the earliest boarding schools were set up for white, rich boys only. Now both boys and girls can go to boarding schools from the age of 7 to 18. What to do In the UK, boarding schools have three terms in a school year, with about 13 weeks in each term. Students study and live together. They can't go outside if they are not allowed to. In some schools, each student has his or her subject plan. Besides the usual classrooms and laboratories, the boarding schools have lots of other _ for their students, including music rooms, boats, swimming pools, cinemas and theatres. Most boarding schools have a \"light out\" time. So when it's time to go to bed, all the lights in the bedrooms are turned off. There are house-masters to take care of students all the time, especially after school hours. What to wear Nearly all students at boarding schools wear a school uniform. Boys usually wear a shirt and a tie, and girls wear a white blouse, sometimes also a tie and a skirt. As students get older, the rules become less strict.  _  In the UK, boarding schools provide students with delicious food. They can choose to have a full English breakfast or simply bread. They can also choose between a meal with no meat and another meal at lunch and dinner. And there is always self-service for salad  , other side dishes and a dessert. Students can also make themselves something to eat at any time in a kitchen, or drink tea or have a snack between meals. Which of the following is TRUE according to   the passage?", "subject": ""}

And another 29 percent of parents have arguments with their kids often when they have different answers to the same question. Now several education scientists strongly advise parents to stop helping.

Well, you now have that girl's opinion. Go and make a list of everything she said and mark the points that are true. Pay no attention to the other things she said.\" I did as he told me. To my great surprise, I discovered that about half the things were true. Some of them I couldn't change (like being very thin), but a good number I could --- and suddenly I wanted to change.

Their teachers, parents or classmates can't stop them because they smoke anywhere they can't be seen --on the way to school, in the dormitory , or even in the washroom.And most of the students think that smoking is very cool.But I want to tell you my story and then you will see that it's wrong to smoke when you are very young. When I was a middle school student, my friends at school smoked and they asked me to have a try. So I started smoking when I was fourteen. Soon I couldn't wait to smoke as soon as I was free. After a month I couldn't stop smoking. But two years later, I felt what smoking was doing to me. I couldn't run far, I coughed every morning, and I got very weak. So I wanted to stop smoking. It wasn't easy, but now I have stopped it, and I feel better. If you smoke, you will get ill more easily, and perhaps you can't grow taller, because there is something bad in cigarettes and also you may get some bad behaviors and habits such as stealing , _ and having a fight with others. So you can see smoking is a bad habit. If you smoke, try to stop. Though it isn't easy, you must do it as soon as possible. What's the main idea of this passage?", "subject": ""}

Reading and sending text messages while asleep--called \"sleep texting\"--is an unusual sleep behaviour, similar to sleepwalking. It's also a growing concern  among doctors: young people can't live without their cell phones. One in three teenagers sends more than 100 text messages a day, according to the Pew Internet & American Life Project. And at least four out of five teenagers said they sleep with their phone on or near their bed. Elizabeth Dowdell, a professor at Villanova University in Pennsylvania, has studied sleeping texting.

And at least four out of five teenagers said they sleep with their phone on or near their bed. Elizabeth Dowdell, a professor at Villanova University in Pennsylvania, has studied sleeping texting. She said that having a phone nearby all night is a big part of the problem. Andrew Stiehm, a sleep medicine expert with Allina Health in Minnesota, agrees. It's possible for the part of the brain that controls motor skills   to wake up, while the part of the brain that controls memory and judgment  may be still asleep. That's why some people can perform basic movements ---such as walking, talking, texting or even driving--while they're sleeping. Some of Dowdell's students said that they're disturbed by their nighttime texting behavior. But because sleep texting is _ , it's a difficult habit to break. Dowdell said she knows of some students who wear socks on their hands to keep themselves from texting.

{"answer": 1, "choices": ["Two.", "Three.", "Four.", "Five."], "question": "Pollution means adding dirty or harmful things to land, air, water and so on. As a result, they are no longer pleasant or safe to use. Pollution is bad for animals and plants, and it even makes people's health in danger. In our daily life, we can see different kinds of pollution in many places. There are three main forms of pollution: land pollution, air pollution and water pollution. Land pollution is caused by solid waste, such as cans, bottles and some plastic things which aren't broken down quickly. It makes the environment look very bad. However, air pollution is more serious than land pollution. It is much worse in cities and towns because of the fumes  from traffic and the waste from human activities. When people drive their cars, fumes which are most made up of CO2, NO2 and SO2 are given off. After the gases get into the air, they may mix with clouds. Then they will become some harmful chemicals   falling on the ground with rain. It is one of the reasons for soil erosion   which is one example of water pollution. Various kinds of pollution will cause many health problems. People have realized they must change this serious situation. There are many ways to control pollution. To develop alternative energy is very popular in many countries. China, for example, has made up its mind to be a leader in this field. It is trying hard to make full use of energy from the sun and wind. It has paid plenty of money to make electric cars and trains instead of traditional traffic.

But it is also true that many children today are using computers at schools before they can write. What does this mean for the future? Are these children lucky or not? Many people do not know about computers and they think of them as machines that children play with. They worry that children do not learn from experience but just from pressing* a button* and that this is not good for them. They think that children are growing not knowing about the real world. And they are very worried about that their children will lose themselves in the computer games. But many people understand more about computers, they say that computers can be very good for children. A computer can help them to learn about the real world more quickly, to learn what they want to learn and think for themselves.

She didn't know what she had to do and wanted to give up. She felt tired of fighting and fighting. One problem had been finished but another came over. Her father, a cook, took her into the kitchen. He poured water into three pans and boiled  them. After boiling, in the first pan was put some carrots, the second was put some eggs and the last was put with coffee. The girl waited impatiently, confused  by what her father did. About 20 minutes later, her father took out the carrots and put them in a bowl. He took the eggs and put them in a bowl. After that the coffee was poured into a cup. \"My sweet heart, what do you see?\" he asked. \"Carrots, eggs and coffee.\" she replied. Her father told her to close her eyes and asked her to touch the carrots. She did so and felt that the carrots were soft. After that he asked her to take the eggs and break them. After peeling  them, she got the eggs, cooked and hard. The last, the father let her smell the coffee.

A green city is a healthy and pleasant place for people to live, according to the United Nations. A green city can get its energy from renewable   sources like solar   and wind power. Also, it is connected by clean public transportation. Moreover, a green city is made up of facilities   that can save energy and reduce waste. Around the world, many cities and countries have done well to build themselves in a green way. Chicago is well known for its green roof   program. These roofs are covered with plants. The plants get a great amount of rainwater. Later, the water evaporates   to help make the air cool and clean. So far, there are about 360 green roofs in Chicago, according to the US Environmental Protection Agency. Curitiba, Brazil, has great transportation. It opened the world's first bus rapid transit (BRT) system in 1974. BRT runs on special lanes. This makes sure that buses are on time even in traffic jams. With the help of BRT, the city has the lowest level of air pollution in Brazil. Today, many other countries have copied BRT, including China and Mexico. Singapore is home to the first zero-energy building in Southeast Asia. Zero energy means a building is able to create more energy than it uses.

Around the world, many cities and countries have done well to build themselves in a green way. Chicago is well known for its green roof   program. These roofs are covered with plants. The plants get a great amount of rainwater. Later, the water evaporates   to help make the air cool and clean. So far, there are about 360 green roofs in Chicago, according to the US Environmental Protection Agency. Curitiba, Brazil, has great transportation. It opened the world's first bus rapid transit (BRT) system in 1974. BRT runs on special lanes. This makes sure that buses are on time even in traffic jams. With the help of BRT, the city has the lowest level of air pollution in Brazil. Today, many other countries have copied BRT, including China and Mexico. Singapore is home to the first zero-energy building in Southeast Asia. Zero energy means a building is able to create more energy than it uses. Zero-energy buildings work with solar panels   mainly on roofs. These panels can make electricity which powers the buildings. By 2030, Singapore plans to build 80 percent of its buildings like this.

About four-fifths of high school students in China have poor eyesight . And now more and more children in primary school need glasses, too. Two main reasons can cause poor eyesight: too much time spent indoors studying and too little time spent outdoors playing. Reading and writing for hours and hours, sometimes in poorly lighted rooms, causes eyesight to weaken. But students have to do this because there is so much pressure on them to succeed in school. They have less time to enjoy the sun. The sun, it turns out, is important in developing good eyesight. According to a study by Australian National University, Australian children and Chinese children have the same level of eyesight before they start school, but once they enter primary school, Chinese children only spend about an hour a day outside, while Australian children spend three to four hours each day in the sunshine. The result is that while about forty percent of Chinese primary school students need glasses, only three percent of Australian children do.

Also, most of earthquake deaths happen after the earthquake, so remember that the danger does not end when the shaking does! If you stay indoors during an earthquake, move away from unsupported areas and windows. Try to get under a doorway or another area of the building which is held up by strong beams .  Stay under a table or desk only if it is very strong. Do not rush to lifts, because it is far safer to stay where you are. Cover your head with your arms around it and curl   into a ball, and wait for the shaking to stop. If you stay outdoors during an earthquake, move to an area which is as open as possible. Don't move to buildings, electric poles and other objects which may fall during an earthquake and injure you.

In the morning, I was surprised to find the bag of food had been open. \"Bears,\" said Joe, \"we should hang the food in a tree tonight.\" Later that day we stopped in a beautiful field by a river. We put up the tent and fell asleep. During the night the bears came again. This time they took the food from the tree. \"Bears can climb trees. They can smell food from a long way away,\" said Ben. \"We must keep the camp clean. Bears must think our rubbish is food,\" I said. \"And we should make lots of noise, too. If they know where we are, they may not come any closer,\" said Joe. \"But if you see a bear,\" said Ben, \"you mustn't make any sudden moves or make a sound, and you mustn't run either. No one can run faster in the forest than a bear. And remember we don't have a gun to keep us safe.\" That night, we went to sleep ... or we tried to. The next day, while the others were resting, I went for a walk in the forest. Suddenly, I saw a baby bear playing with some sticks and stones. He looked so soft and friendly, and I thought, \"If I reach out, I can just touch him.\" There was a loud noise behind me. I didn't dare to move, not even turn my head. There was another loud noise. The baby bear looked up, and ran towards me. I turned pale and he ran past me into the woods. I couldn't turn round until a few minutes later. Then I saw the baby bear and his huge mother walking away. I ran back to my friends. I have never run so fast. For the next 10 days, every time there was sudden noise, my blood went cold. Why did the writer run back fast to his friends?", "subject": ""}
