It means that we live among competing interests. Your roommate's need to study for an exam take priority over pizza. Your instructor may have good reasons not to change your grade. And the object of your romantic interest may have other choices. In such a world, persuasion is the art of getting others to give fair and favorable consideration to our points of view. When we persuade, we want to influence what others believe and how they behave. We may not always prevail --other points of view may be more persuasive, depending on the listener, the situation, and the merits of the case. But when we practice the art of persuasion, we try to ensure that our position receives the attention it deserves. Some people, however, object to the very idea of persuasion. They may regard it as an unwelcome approach to their lives or as a control. In contrast, we believe that persuasion is inevitable--to live is to persuade. Persuasion may be moral or immoral, selfless or selfish, inspiring or discouraging. Persuaders may enlighten our minds or make us hurt. Moral persuasion, however, calls on sound reasoning and is sensitive to the feelings and needs of listeners. Such persuasion can help us apply the wisdom of the past to the decisions we now must make.

{"answer": 2, "choices": ["have a strong will", "talk less and show off less", "learn more than extroverts", "have a good attitude to learning"], "question": "It is true that shyness can be a disadvantage socially for those who suffer from it seriously. I mean real shyness, not somebody who is simply quiet. Quiet people could be shy, but on the other hand, they may just be observing because they are unsure of you or others in your company. They may be capable of being extrovert   and sociable, but on some particular occasions, they are quiet. I have learnt from my experience that those who observe and listen more and talk less can gain a position of strength. This means that even a very shy person, the type who is reluctant to talk in company   , especially new company, can become a strong person in just about anything they choose. Remember, knowledge is power, and a shy introvert   is in a better position to gain knowledge than an extrovert. Introverted people can give great attention to learning, and as good listeners they can take in an enormous amount from others. Over time, people can come to respect them far more than the extrovert who speaks a lot. Usually about themselves. What does it take , then for a very shy person to be that successful person they have always wanted to be ? They may only need one more thing to push themselves on their way. They need to dare themselves to take the leap; and when they do , they will probably find all the knowledge they have gained over the years will help them on their way to the top in their chosen field.

{"answer": 1, "choices": ["Shorter and shorter summertime.", "Ice-free summer around the Arctic.", "Lower sea levels.", "More rainy skies."], "question": "Unusual incidents are being reported across the Arctic. Inuit families going off on snowmobiles to prepare their summer hunting camps have found themselves cut off from home by a sea of mud. There are also reports of sea ice breaking up earlier than usual, carrying seals beyond the reach of hunters. Climate change may still be a rather abstract idea to most of us, but in the Arctic it is already having great effect--if summertime ice continues to shrink at its present rate, the Arctic Ocean could soon become almost ice-free in summer. The knock-on effects are likely to include more warming, cloudier skies and higher sea levels. Scientists are increasingly eager to find out what's going on in the Arctic. For the Inuit the problem is urgent. They live in unsteady balance with one of the toughest environments on earth. Climate change, whatever its causes, is a direct danger to their way of life. Nobody knows the Arctic as well as the locals, which is why they are not content simply to stand back and let outsider experts tell them what's happening. In Canada, where the Inuit people are trying hard to guard their hard-won autonomy in the country's newest land, Nunavut, they believe their best hope of survival in this changing environment lies in combining their ancestral   knowledge with the best of modern science. This is a challenge in itself. The Canadian Arctic is a vast, treeless polar desert that's covered with snow for most of the year. Adventure into this area and you get some idea of the hardships facing anyone who calls this home. Farming is out of the question and nature offers few pickings. Humans first settled in the Arctic a mere 4,500 years ago, surviving by taking advantage of sea first.

But do you know if a color has weight? I think you'll say \"no\". But I am afraid you are wrong. If you don't believe, you may do a small experiment. First, put two objects  with the same weight into two boxes. Then cover the box. Third, wrap  one box with a red piece of paper, the other with a white piece of paper. OK. Now hold the boxes with your hand one by one. It is certain that you will think the red one is a little heavier. Why do you think so? A scientist found that different colors have different weights in a man's mind. So he did many tests and at last he got the result. That is to say, every color has its own weight in our mind and their order is the same. The heaviest color is red, then blue, green, yellow and white. The scientist told us that colors also have smell. Can you smell the color? Of course not. Then why did the scientist say so? That is because every color stands for  a kind of light with a certain wavelength . It reaches our brain through sense organs . According to this discovery, scientists say that people accept the colors they like, and refuse the colors they hate. So your body and mind will be healthy by using the colors you like. Or you'll be nervous or ill. For example, if you stay in a room with red windows, wallpapers and furniture for two hours, you'll feel you have been there for four hours. But if the room is blue, you'll feel you have been there for only an hour. Another example, if a person walks out of a red room and into a blue room, his temperature will fall.

Today, however, Dad would say no more ,and caught up in the business of our new life ,I eventually forgot about his surprise. Until one gloomy day the next March when I glanced out of the window,I saw a dot of blue across the yard. I headed outside for a closer look. They were crocuses  throughout the front lawn  blue, yellow and my favorite pink ,with little faces moving up and down in the cold wind. I remembered the things Dad secretly planted last autumn.

But does Mother Nature agree? Animals can't talk, but can they lie in other ways? Can they lie with their bodies and behavior? Animal experts may not call it lying, but they do agree that many animals, from birds to chimpanzees, behave dishonestly to fool other animals. Why? Dishonesty often helps them survive. Many kinds of birds are very successful at fooling other animals. For example, a bird called the plover sometimes pretends to be hurt in order to protect its young. When a predator   gets close to its nest, the plover leads the predator away from the nest. How? It pretends to have a broken wing. The predator follows the \"hurt\" adult, leaving the baby birds safe in the nest. Another kind of bird, the scrub jay, buries its food so it always has something to eat. Scrub  jays are also thieves. They watch where others bury their food and steal it. But clever scrub jays seem to know when a thief is watching them. So they go back later, unbury the food, and bury it again somewhere else. Birds called cuckoos have found a way to have babies without doing much work. How? They don't make nests. Instead, they get into other birds' nests secretly. Then they lay their eggs and fly away.

A holy man in India may think that happiness is in himself. It is in needing nothing from outside himself. In wanting nothing, he lacks nothing. We westerners, however, are taught that the more we have from outside ourselves, the happier we will be, and then we are made to want. We are even told it is our duty to want. Advertising, one of our major industries, exists not to satisfy these desires but to create them--and to create them faster than any man's money in his pocket can satisfy them. Here, obviously someone is trying to buy the dream of happiness and spending millions upon millions every year in the attempt. Clearly the happiness-market is not running out of customers.     I doubt the holy man's idea of happiness, and I doubt the dreams of the happiness-market, too. Whatever happiness may be, I believe, it is neither in having nothing nor in having more, but in changing--in changing the world and mankind into pure states.      To change is to make efforts to deal with difficulties. As Yeats, a great Irish poet once put it, happiness we get for a lifetime depends on how high we choose our difficulties. Robert Frost, a great American poet, was thinking in almost the stone terms when he spoke of \"the pleasure of taking pains.\" It is easy to understand. We even demand difficulty for the fun in our games. We demand it because without difficulty there can be no game. And a game is a way of making something hard for the fun of it. The rules of the game are man-made difficulties. When the player ruins the fun, he always does so by refusing to play by the roles. It is easier to win at chess if you are free, at your pleasure, to cast away all the rules, but the fun is in winning within the rules. The same is true to happiness. The buyers and sellers at the happiness-market seem to have lost their sense of the pleasure of difficulty. Heaven knows what they are playing, but it seems a dull game. And the Indian holy man seems dull to us, I suppose, because he seems to be refusing to play anything at all.

{"answer": 1, "choices": ["A newspaper.", "A magazine on science.", "A fairy tale.", "A scientific fantasy book."], "question": "In a few years,you might be able to speak Chinese,Korean,Japanese,French,and English-and all at the same time. This sounds incredible,but Alex Waibel,a computer science professor at US's Car-negie Mellon University (CMU) and Germany's University of Karlsruhe,announced last week that it may soon be reality. He and his team have invented software and hardware that could make it far easier for people who speak different languages to understand each other. One application,called Lecture Translation,can easily translate a speech from one language into an-other. Current translation technologies typically limit speakers to certain topics or a limited vocabulary. Us-ers also have to be trained how to use the programme. Another machine can send translations of a speech to different listeners depending on what languagethey speak. \"It is like having a s _ translator right next to you but without disturbing the person next to you,\"Waibel said Prefer to read? So- called Translation Glasses transcribe  the translations on a tiny liquid-crystal display(LCD) screen. Then there's the Muscle Translator. Electrodes capture the electrical signals from facial muscle movements made naturally when a person is mouthing words. The signals are then translated into speech.The electrodes could be replaced with wireless chips implanted in a person's face,according to research-ers.

Unfortunately, the serious effect of the problem can become worse for two reasons. One is that since the behavior progress behind closed doors, people can accumulate collections of objects for years before friends or family members become aware of the problem. A second reason is that hoarders often don't recognize that they have a problem, and will continue to live in denial until they get professional help. When attempting to make a diagnosis, psychologists don't regard hoarding as a disorder in itself. Instead, it's often seen as a symptom of obsessive-compulsive disorder  , depression, or anxiety.

New research has determined that the ability to quantify may develop much sooner than most parents realize.

As long as the difference between the two substances is large enough, infants will choose the larger amount, especially when it comes to food. With the assistance of her team researchers, vanMarle tested the quantifying skills of babies by presenting them with two cups: one containing a small amount of food, and one containing a larger amount. Consistently, the babies chose the larger amount. \"Several studies throughout the last 15 years have shown that infants are very good at telling how many objects they see; however, infants don't seem to count things like water or sand,\" vanMarle said. \"What we're saying is that they can quantify substances; The infants can see how much food goes into each cup and compare that in their memories.

Taking an Uber car may no longer be a direct driver-passenger and guilt-free experience. The ride-sharing experience is about to get awkward. With the wide application of the Internet, Uber, a new approach to your destination instead of taking an ordinary taxi, has become more popular recently. However, benefits won't come without its fair share of drawbacks. Uber drivers are a part of the so-called sharing economy: They use their own vehicles, receive customer reviews via the app's five-star rating system and make their own hours. Unlike other services, Uber claimed that drivers all over the country could clearly alert customers that tipping is not included. Those drivers that expect to be tipped can make their wishes known. But the company is holding to its official no-tip-required line, according to its website. \"Once you arrive at your destination, your fare is automatically charged to your credit card on file--There's no need to tip.\" Although drivers value their independence--the freedom to push a button rather than punch a clock, lack of a clear policy, however, leaves Uber drivers in a vulnerable  position: If they ask a customer for a tip or put up a sign, that customer could give the driver a low star-rating, and the driver could finally be _ from the app. But has the company done a good job working with customers?

Google's approach, called statistical  machine translation, differs from past efforts in which it does without language experts who program grammatical rules and dictionaries into computers. Instead, they feed documents humans have already translated into two languages and then rely on computers to decide patterns for future translations. Though the quality is not perfect, it is an improvement on previous efforts at machine translation, said Franz Och, 35, a German who heads Google's translation effort at its Mountain View headquarters south of San Francisco. \"Some people who have been in machine translations for a long time see our Arabic-English output, and then they say, that's amazing; that's a breakthrough .\" Said Och. \"And then other people who have never seen what machine translation was read through the sentence and they say, the first mistake here in Line Five-it doesn't seem to work because there is a mistake there.\" But for some tasks, a mostly correct translation may be good enough. Speaking over lunch this week in a Google cafeteria famed for offering free, healthy food, Och showed a translation of an Arabic Web news site into easily digestible English. Two Google workers speaking Russian at a nearby table said, however, that a translation of a news site from English into their native tongue was understandable but a bit awkward. Och, who speaks German, English and some Italian, feeds hundreds of millions of words from parallel texts such as Arabic and English into the computer, using United Nations and European Union documents as key sources. Languages without considerable translated texts, such as some African languages, face greater obstacles. \"The more data we feed into the system, the better it gets.\" said Och, who moved to the United States from Germany in 2002. The program applies statistical analysis, an approach he hopes will avoid diplomatic embarrassing mistakes in diplomatic situations, such as when Russian leader Putin's translator annoyed then German Chancellor  Gerhard Schroeder by calling him the German \"Fuhrer (\"leader\" in English),\" which is forbidden in that context because of its association with Adolf Hitler. \"I would hope that the language model would say, well, Schroeder is...very rare but Bundeskanzler Gerhard Schroeder is probably 100 times more frequent than Fuhrer and then it would make the right decision.\" Och said.

I was a second grader, but my best friend Stephanie was only in the first grade. Both of our parents were at work and most of the time they let us go our own way.  It was a hot afternoon and we decided to have an adventure in Stephanie's basement. As I opened the basement door, before us lay the biggest room, full of amazing things like guns, dolls, and old clothes. I ran downstairs, and spotted red steel can. It was paint. I looked beyond it and there lay even more paint in bright color1s like purple, orange, blue and green.  \"Stephanie, I just found us a project for the day. Get some paintbrushes. We are fixing to paint.\" She screamed with excitement as I told her of my secret plans and immediately we got to work. We gathered all the brushes we could find and moved all of our materials to my yard. There on the road in front of my house, we painted bit stripes   of color1s across the pavement  . Stripe by stripe, our color1s turned into a beautiful rainbow. It was fantastic! The sun was starting to sink. I saw a car in the distance and jumped up as I recognized the car. It was my mother. I couldn't wait to show her my masterpiece. The car pulled slowly into the driveway and from the look on my mother's face, I could tell that I was in deep trouble.  My mother shut the car door and walked towards me. Her eyes glaring, she shouted, \"What in the world were you thinking? I understood when you made castles out of leaves, and climbed the neighbors' trees, but this! Come inside right now!\" I stood there glaring hack at her for a minute, angry because she had insulted   my art.   \"Now go clean it up!\" Mother and I began cleaning the road. Tears ran down my cheeks as I saw my beautiful rainbow turn into black cement.    Though years have now passed, I still wonder where my rainbow has gone.

Forty yards later, at the finish line, the heavily feathered bird beats the speeding human! The competition isn't terribly close between the ostrich and the football player, but in a surprise move, the pig moves fast and manages to beat the squirrel by a nose.

Around 1870,it was experiencing an economic  boom, and the capital, Buenos Aires, attracted many people. Farmers, as well as a flood of foreigners from Spain and Italy, came to Buenos Aires seeking jobs. These jobs didn't pay well, and the people felt lonely and disappointed with their new life in the city. As the unhappy newcomers mixed together in the poor parts of the city, the dance known an the tango  came into being. At the beginning the tango was a dance of the lower classes. It was danced in the bars and streets. At that time there many fewer women the men, so if a man didn't want to be left out, his only choice was to dance with another man so that he could attract the attention of the few available women. Gradually, the dance spread into the upper classes of Argentinean society and became more respectable. In Europe at this time, strong interest in dance from around the world was beginning. This interest in international dance was especially evident in Paris. Every kind of dance from ballet  to belly dancing could be found on the stages of the Paris theaters of the Paris theaters. After tango dances from Argentina arrive in Europe, they began to draw the interest of the public as they performed their exciting dance in cafes. Though not everyone approved of the new dance, saying it was a little too shocking, the dance did find enough supporters to make it popular. The popularity  of the tango continued to grow in many other parts of the world. Soldiers who returned to the United States from World War I brought the tango to North America.

The study's authors, psychology professors, Aurora Sherman of Oregon State University and Eileen Zurbriggen at UC Santa Cruz, describe their findings as significant. \"This is one of the first studies to investigate how playing with sexualized   dolls affects young girls, and also one of the first to look at the impact of such play on achievement or career aspirations  , rather than body image,\" said Zurbriggen. Sherman suggests that Barbie and similar dolls are part of the burden of early and inappropriate sexuality placed on girls.  Sherman and Zurbriggen used girls' doll play to study the impact of gender role socialization, a process through which children learn to follow cultural norms and which encourages gender stereotypical   behavior. Thirty-seven girls from the age of four to seven from an Oregon college town were randomly arranged to play for five minutes with either a sexualized Doctor Barbie or Fashion Barbie doll, or with a more neutral   Mrs. Potato Head doll. The girls were then shown photographs of ten occupations and asked how many they themselves or boys could do in the future. The girls who played with a Barbie doll saw themselves in fewer occupations, compared with boys. Those girls who played with Mrs. Potato Head reported nearly as many career options available for themselves as for boys. The two Barbie dolls were the same except for clothing, with unrealistic bodies, extremely youthful and attractive faces, and long full hair. The researchers believe that the doll itself has more of an effect on girls than the role or career aspirations suggested by its costume. \"It's significant that a few minutes of play with a Barbie doll had an immediate impact on the number of careers that girls saw as possible for themselves,\" Zurbriggen said.

It treats a digital book like a paperback copy. It charges libraries per book per copy and gives publishers a cut of the total income. From the consumer's point of view, this means that if more than five people want the latest Danielle Steel romance novel, other people who request that book will get a message saying the title is unable to get. Many publishers seem to have embraced its model. More than 350 publishers gave the company rights to hand out their digital works, and McGraw-Hill Corporation and Houghton Mifflin Corporation have put money into the company. The California public libraries and about 1,800 others across the US are trying out the Net Library service. Some librarians criticize the Net Library model. Stanford University librarian Michael Keller argues that the company is creating an unnatural fear of digital works, which is contrary to the ideas of the Internet. Keller and some other librarians argue for the e-book vision set forth by Brary. Brary is starting a service that lets us users read books for free. But it will charge about 25 cents a page when a person tries to point out material or copy and taste it into a different file or tries to download a copy onto a computer. Christopher Warnock, chief executive of Brary, believes most consumers won't want to buy entire books, only the parts that interest them. \"There is not really a lot of good owning an electronic file and having to store it and manage it. It doesn't make sense,\" he said. How do publishers get money from the Net Library?", "subject": ""}

Looking back on my first couple of weeks of living in student halls, I consider myself lucky to still be alive. Unfamiliar to fresher's, there are many hidden dangers in the dirty corners of students accommodation. I have survived a couple of serious boiling egg incidents and lots of cases of food - poisoning, probably from dirty kitchen counters. Although some of my clothes have fallen victim to ironing experimentation, I think I have now finally acquired all the domestic   skills I missed out in my modem education. In 2006 and 2010, the charming educationist Sir Ken Robinson gave two very amusing talks in which he discussed the importance of creativity in education. Robinson's main viewpoint is that our current education system dislocates people from their natural talents. I would like to go a step further and propose that besides our talents, the system takes away what used to be passed from generation to generation - a working knowledge of basic life skills. Today's graduates may have earned themselves honor in history, law or economies, but when it comes to simple things like putting up a shelf to hold all their academic books, or fixing a hole in their on - trend clothes, they have to call for help from a professional handyman or tailor. Since the invention of the internet, it has never been easier for people to access information, but our highly specialized education has made us more one - sided than ever. I suggest that we start with the immediate reintroduction of some of the most vital aspects of \"domestic science\" education, before the current lack leads to serious accidents in student halls.

The enthusiasm which greeted the Diamond Jubilee was, of course, especially memorable for me and my family. It was humbling that so many chose to mark the anniversary of a duty which passed to me 60 years ago. People of all ages took the trouble to take part in various ways and in many nations. But perhaps most striking of all was to witness the strength of fellowship and friendship among those who had gathered together on these occasions. On the barges and the bridges and the banks of the river there were people who had taken their places to cheer through the mist, undaunted by the rain. That day there was a tremendous sense of common determination to celebrate, triumphing  over the elements. That same spirit was also in evidence from the moment the Olympic flame arrived on these shores. The flame itself drew hundreds and thousands of people on its journey around the British Isles, and was carried by every kind of deserving individual, many nominated for their own extraordinary service. As London hosted a splendid summer of sport, all those who saw the achievement and courage at the Olympic and Paralympic Games were further inspired by the skill, dedication, training and teamwork of our athletes. In pursuing their own sporting goals, they gave the rest of us the opportunity to share something of the excitement and drama. We were reminded, too, that the success of these great festivals depended to an enormous degree upon the dedication and effort of an army of volunteers. Those public-spirited people came forward in the great tradition of all those who devote themselves to keeping others safe, supported and comforted.

While the planet's presumably molten surface and hot temperatures make it ill-suited for life, two independent teams of astronomers jumped at the opportunity to follow up the discovery with ground-based measurements to try to determine the density of Kepler-78b. In two papers in this week's journal Nature, the teams report that not only were they successful, but that they came to the same conclusion: Kepler-78b has roughly the same density as Earth, suggesting that it also is made primarily of rock and iron. Kepler-78b is among a dozen or so recently discovered small planets that orbit very close to their parent stars. Kepler-78b, for example, completes an orbit in just 8.5 hours.

The \"Wen Ding\", an ancient cooking container, served the same purpose, but instead of using electric energy, the ancient cooking container, served the same purpose, but instead of using electric energy, the ancient cooking container preserved heart by burning fuels like charcoal. The \"Wen Ding\" unearthed in Nanjing in 1989 is thought to be the oldest of its kind discovered in China, dating back to the Stone Age, The craftsmanship of making the \"Wen Ding\" was developed in the Bronze Age. The bronze Ding from Shang and Zhou dynasties took on different shapes and structures. * \"Ran LU\", ancient small hot pot The \"Ran LU\" is a small size cooking vessel  made of bronze, which can be divided into three parts. A charcoal stove forms the main structure, with a bottom tray to hold charcoal ashes, and a movable cup at the top. Some experts have concluded that the vessel's structure suggests it may have been used as a small hot pot and that these vessels became popular in the Warring States Period(475--221 BC) *Bronze You, ancient kettle The Bronze You was one of the most common wine containers during the Shang and Zhou dynasties. The Bronze You can also be used to warm wine. For example, the Bronze You with beast mask design, unearthed in Jiangxi province, has an opening where charcoals could be placed. Just as people today can't do without an electric kettle, the Bronze You allowed people to enjoy a hot drink. *Bronze Yan, ancient steamer Although the \"Wen Ding\" was effective at keeping food warm, the ancient Chinese people later found that its burning produced pollution. As a result, the Bronze Yan was made with a two-tier structure and used to steam rice and other grains. After the Eastern Han Dynasty (AD 25-AD 220), further improvements to the Bronze Yan led to the modern-day steamer.

There was a boy, who, as it turned out, was an orphan and was living and working for a small farming family. He didn't appear at first glance to ever be fully engaged  in the school learning process;he would sit quietly, never seem to get any attention from the teacher, and would spend a lot of time staring out of the window just behind him. Over the next few weeks, I got to know this boy while playing outside in the schoolyard playing baseball, or soccer. He was very athletic and very good at anything we played. I started to wonder why he didn't seem to do well in school and why the teacher ignored him. He told me he had been in several foster   homes since he was a little boy and that most of his time in the last few years had always been on farms. He said he was made to work before he went to school and as soon as he got home until it was time for bed. He was never given a chance to go out and play, nor was he allowed to have any friends although he told me he really didn't have any friends anyway, because he was an orphan and they did not want anything to do with him. I had never before been acquainted with prejudice of any kind. Here was one characteristic of a human being who through no fault of his own carried a label that prevented him from even having friends as a child.

If cities are to remain pleasant places to live in at all, however, it seems imperative , not only that communications in transport should be improved, but also that communication between human beings should be kept smooth and polite. All over cities, it seems that people are too tired and too rushed to be polite. Shop assistant's won't bother to assist, taxi drivers growl at each other as they dash dangerously round corners, bus conductors pull the bell before their desperate passengers have had time to get on or off the bus, and so on and so on. It seems to us that it is up to the young and strong to do their small part to stop such deterioration . How could you describe the tone of this passage?", "subject": ""}

That's because Garamba is huge, extending over nearly 2,000 square miles of mostly forested land, and it's a rare, lucky event to come across any of its 40 remaining giraffes. But Hamlin's thrill at seeing and photographing the giraffes didn't last long. Twelve hours later, people looking after the national park reported hearing gunshots, and they later discovered three bullet-riddled bodies of dead giraffes in the sun. \"It was horrible for me and the team,\" Hamlin says \"to realize that most likely it was these guys, _ we'd seen.\" Hamlin decided to document the sad event to raise awareness about illegally shooting animals in the park. Garamba is Africa's second oldest national park and has been hit hard by illegal shooting in recent years. Its rhinos have been wiped out, and elephants have suffered huge losses. The same goes for its Kordofan giraffes, one of Africa's nine giraffe subspecies. Fewer than 2,000 now wander central Africa, according to Julian Fennessy, co-director of the Giraffe Conservation Foundation. Garamba's Kordofan giraffes represent the last population in the Democratic Republic of the Congo. \"If the number slips in half, then we're in an extremely serious situation,\" Fennessy says. \"Every single giraffe is valuable.\" Congolese usually kill the giraffes for one body part, their tails, considered a rank symbol in some communities. Meanwhile men from neighboring South Sudan target the giraffes for their meat to feed poor villagers. But the massive bodies (giraffes can grow to 18 feet and weigh up to 3,000 pounds) of these three giraffes were complete -- only the ends of their tails were missing. According to Leon Lamprecht, joint operations director for African Parks, \"men use the tail as treasure to the bride's father if they want to ask for the hand of a bride.\" \"What an absolute waste!\" Lamprecht says.

Many urban Spaniards complain of a never-ending workday that begins in the morning but is interrupted by a traditional late-morning break and then again by the midday siesta--a two-hour long lunch and nap that usually start at 2 pm. If workers return to their desks at 4 pm, they end up working late into the evening. Under the proposed new schedule, the lunchtime break would be cut to an hour or less. The interruption-filled Spanish workday would be replaced by something closer to a 9-to-5 schedule. Ignacio Buqueras, president of the Association for the Rationalization of Spanish Working Hours, told The New York Times that changing the Spanish schedule would be good news for working mothers. It would also allow families more free time together and boost Spain's economic recovery. Maria Angles Duran, a sociologist with the Spanish National Research Council, is skeptical that changing the time zone will reverse low productivity, which she attributes more to the structure of the service-oriented economy.

Many people regard long afternoon naps and late dinners as perfect aspects of the Spanish way of life. Until the 1940s, Spain was on the same time as Britain and Portugal. In World War II, Spain and Portugal moved the clocks forward to align them with Nazi Germany. The same happened in Portugal. After the defeat of Hitler, Portugal returned to Greenwich Mean Time, but Spain did not. \"The fact that for more than 71 years Spain has not been in its proper time zone means we sleep almost an hour less than the World Health Organization recommends,\" lawmakers in the Spanish Parliament wrote in a proposal.\"This has a negative effect on productivity, absenteeism, stress, accidents and school drop-out rates.\" Last September, a parliamentary commission recommended that the government turn back the clocks by one hour and introduce a regular eight-hour workday.

Airlines have stopped or changed the flights across the Atlantic Ocean, leaving hundreds of passengers stuck in airports. Grimsvotn is one of the largest and most active volcanoes in Europe. What makes Grimsvotn different is that it lies under a huge glacier of ice up to 12 metres thick. The hot volcano heats up the ice above it, which then forms a layer  of water between glacier and the volcano, keeping it stable. As the water flows out from under the glacier, the pressure lifts. The lava  from the volcano then comes up to the surface. This is exactly what is happening today. Now airlines have to make changes to their flights so as not to fly through the clouds of volcanic ash. According to KLM, one of Europe's biggest airlines, airplanes cannot go under the cloud or over it. Going through the cloud can result in ash getting stuck in the airplane's engines, causing damage to the plane. The eruption has also caused problems for animals in Iceland.

Half were asked to write about the most upsetting experience in their life, describing their deepest thoughts, feelings, and emotions about the events, ideally not previously shared with others.

I want to tell you how proud we are. Getting into Columbia is a real testament of what a great well-rounded student you are. Your academic, artistic, and social skills have truly blossomed in the last few years. You have become a talented and accomplished young woman. College will be the most important years in your life. It is in college that you will truly discover what learning is about. You often question \"what good is this course\". I encourage you to be inquisitive, but I also want to tell you: \"Education is what you have left after all that is taught is forgotten.\" What I mean by that is the materials taught isn't as important as you gaining the ability to learn a new subject, and the ability to analyze a new problem. That is really what learning in college is about - this will be the period where you go from teacher-taught to master-inspired, after which you must become self-learner. So do take each subject seriously, and even if what you learn isn't critical for your life, the skills of learning will be something you cherish forever. Follow your passion in college. Take courses you think you will enjoy. Don't be trapped in what others think or say. Steve Jobs says when you are in college, your passion will create many dots, and later in your life you will connect them. In his great speech given at Stanford commencement, he gave the great example where he took calligraphy, and a decade later, it became the basis of the beautiful Macintosh fonts, which later ignited desktop publishing, and brought wonderful tools like Microsoft Word to our lives. His expedition into calligraphy was a dot, and the Macintosh became the connecting line. Enjoy picking your dots, and be assured one day you will find your calling, and connect a beautiful curve through the dots of yourself . Most importantly, make friends and be happy. College friends are often the best in life, because during college you are closer to them physically than to your family. Also, going through independence and adulthood is a natural bonding experience. So please treasure your college years - make the best of your free time, become an independent thinker in control of your destiny, evolve yourself into a bi-cultural talent, be bold to experiment, learn and grow through your successes and challenges. When I faced the greatest challenge and opportunity in my life in 2005, you gave me a big hug and said \"bonne chance\", which means \"good luck\" and \"good courage\". Now I do the same for you.

The poem, which can be understood as \"A man sees a bunch of faces in the subway and thinks they look like flowers on a tree branch,\" is an exercise in shortness. Pound wrote it after having a spiritual experience in a Paris metro (subway) station. In 1916, the US poet originally thought he could best describe his vision in a painting. Unfortunately, he wasn't a painter. So he wrote a thirty-line poem, which he didn't like. He dropped the long version in the waste bin. Six months later, he wrote a shorter poem, but didn't like that one either. Finally, a full year after the experience, he had been reading short Japanese poems called haikus, and he figured he would try this style. The result, which was published in 1913, is one of the most famous and influential works in modern poetry. This poem is one of the monuments   of the 20th-century artistic movement known as \"Imagism\". Basically, Pound and his friends thought that images   weren't just decoration: they were the highest form of speech. By finding the right image, the poet can express the true, spiritual reality of a thing, which is more important than using a bunch of adjectives to describe its physical appearance. Thus, \"In a Station of the Metro\" is a poem that consists of one image expressed with absolute   exactness and nothing else.

But it can be more exciting if there are dolphins swimming around and jumping out of the sea too. For many people, it would be a wonderful dream to swim with these lovely animals! However, this may not be good for dolphins. They may get hurt because of human interaction  . Dolphins are active and usually look for food at night. In the day, they like to rest in shallow bays . Many people think the dolphins are awake during the day as they swim. But when they sleep they rest half of their brain and keep the other half awake to breathe, so they may be sleeping even when they're swimming in the water. From 2010 to 2013, spinner dolphins   of Hawaii's Big Island were exposed to human activities more than 82 percent of the time, according to Julian Tyne, a researcher at Australia's Murdoch University.

Besides, when people are around, dolphins become more active. Thus, they can't get enough sleep. \"Disturbing their resting behaviors can actually affect their long term health and the health of the dolphin population,\" Ann Garrett of NOAA's National Marine Fisheries Service told the Associated Press. As a result, the NOAA wants to make rules to help protect the dolphins. For example, the agency   may ban swimming with the Hawaii spinner dolphins.

Before it opened, the only way to get between the two cities was by ferry. However, the waterway was at the mercy of severe storms and when two ferries overturned in 1955, killing 168 people, public anger convinced the government of the need for a bridge. It's the longest suspension bridge in the world, with a length of 1,991 meters. Panama Canal, Panama More than 4. 5 million cubic yards of concrete were used in the construction of this canal's locks and dams. The Panama Canal is a 47-mile long waterway that connects the Atlantic and Pacific Oceans. The earth and rubble dug to make way for it was enough to bury Manhattan to a depth of four meters. A series of locks allows ships to pass through the water. Each lock door weighs 750 tons and each lock fills with 52 million gallons of water to accommodate the 15,000 ships that use the canal every year. Grand Canyon Skywalk, Arizona The Skywalk's foundation is strong enough to support 71 million pounds , Located 1,219 meters above the Colorado River, the Grand Canyon's Sky Walk consists of one million pounds of steel and 83,000 pounds of glass. It was the creation of Las Vegas businessman David Jin, who approached the Hualapai Tribe with the idea of a glass walkway over the Grand Canyon in 1996. The Sky walk was assembled on site.

The reason why there are only few of them is that most people do not pay the price of greatness.There are so many people who want to be great,why only very few of them actually pay the price? The answer to the question explains the difference between the almost 100% people who want to be great and the much less than 0.01% who actually be so.The reason is that the road to greatness is full of pains. Greatness requires sacrifices and there is no sacrifice without pain.The kind of sacrifices required for greatness is the ones that make the process continuously painful for long time.If you only want to be good it may be painful just every now and then,and many people can still handle it.But being great is a total difference.The pain is much deeper and it is continuous,so very few people can endure this kind of pain.Most people naturally choose things that bring pleasures to them.It's unnatural to choose pain over pleasure,let alone doing it continuously for long time.But that's what I believe is the secret to greatness: The secret to greatness is choosing pain over pleasures continuously for long time.

He studied how to put a pipe inside the heart to measure the pressure inside and decide whether a patient needs surgery. Experiments had been done on horses before, so he wanted to try with human patients. But it was not permitted because the experiment was considered too dangerous. Not giving up, Forssmann decided to experiment on himself. He anaesthetized   his own arm and made a cut, putting the pipe 30 centimeters into his vein. He then climbed two floors to the X-ray room before pushing the pipe all the way into his heart. 2. Barry Marshall (Nobel prize winner in 2005) Most doctors in the mid-20th century believed that _ was down to stress, spicy food or an unusually large amount of stomach acid. But in 1979 an Australian scientist named Robin Warren found that the disease might be related to a bacteria called Helicobacter pylori. So he teamed up with his colleague, Barry Marshall, to continue the study. When their request to experiment on patients was denied, Marshall bravely drank some of the bacteria. Five days later, he lost his appetite and soon was vomiting each morning - he indeed had gastritis. 3. Ralph Steinman (Nobel prize winner in 2011) This Canadian scientist discovered a new type of immune system cell called the dendritic cell. He believed that it had the ability to fight against cancer. Steinman knew he couldn't yet use his method to treat patients. So in 2007, when doctors told him that he had cancer and that it was unlikely for him to live longer than a year, he saw an opportunity. With the help of his colleagues, he gave himself three different vaccines based on his research and a total of eight experimental therapies.

But there are three Nobel prize-winning scientists who actually chose to experiment on themselves - all in the name of science, reported The Telegraph. 1. Werner Forssmann (Nobel prize winner in 1956) Forssmann was a German scientist. He studied how to put a pipe inside the heart to measure the pressure inside and decide whether a patient needs surgery. Experiments had been done on horses before, so he wanted to try with human patients. But it was not permitted because the experiment was considered too dangerous. Not giving up, Forssmann decided to experiment on himself. He anaesthetized   his own arm and made a cut, putting the pipe 30 centimeters into his vein. He then climbed two floors to the X-ray room before pushing the pipe all the way into his heart. 2. Barry Marshall (Nobel prize winner in 2005) Most doctors in the mid-20th century believed that _ was down to stress, spicy food or an unusually large amount of stomach acid. But in 1979 an Australian scientist named Robin Warren found that the disease might be related to a bacteria called Helicobacter pylori. So he teamed up with his colleague, Barry Marshall, to continue the study. When their request to experiment on patients was denied, Marshall bravely drank some of the bacteria.

The smell of popcorn played on the breeze, and life seemed good. It was one of the happiest Saturday mornings I had spent with my little daughter, Gigi. That is, until two strangers threw her into their car and sped away. It seemed like a bad dream. I could barely whisper when the police questioned me. For hours we waited,but there was no word on the whereabouts of the car. Tears would start to come. Then nothing. I was numb with fear. \"Go home, Ma'am,\" the police officer said. \"I'll have someone drive you. We'll also want to monitor your telephone. The kidnappers might call, and we'll want to keep track. Trust me, these guys can't get far. \" After what had just happened, it was hard for me to trust anything. My friend Gloria came over that afternoon. \"I heard about Gigi on the radio,\" she said. \"Everyone is looking for the car. The interstates are all blocked.\" She took my hand. \"Look here,\" Gloria said. \" I want you to have this picture, and I want you to pray with me.\" It was a picture of a little girl sound asleep in her bed. Standing by the bed was a tall, blond angel. His hand was touching the girl's shoulder as he smiled down at her. My nerves were frazzled. \"You know I don't believe in that kind of thing!\" I snapped. \"I'm too exhausted for any hocus-pocus right now, Gloria!I want my daughter home!\" I started to shake, and then I began sobbing. Gloria placed the photo on our mantle and knelt down beside me. \"Just pray with me,\" she said, holding my hand. I had no strength left, so we prayed and waited what seemed an eternity. Together, we waited by the phone until sunset. The phone never rang. Suddenly, the front door swung open. I looked up and screamed. There stood Gigi. \"Gigi! Thank God!\" I cried, throwing my arms around her, \"Where did those men take you? How did you get home? Did the police find you?\" \"No Mommy!\" said Gigi. \"I was really scared because those men said they were taking me far away. We were going really fast on an old rock road never seen before. But then a tall man walked out in front of the car, and they ran off the road and hit a tree.\" Then the tall man ran up and opened the car door and pulled me out. He was really nice, and said I would be okay now, and that those men couldn't hurt me. I must have gone to sleep, because then I woke up here in front of our house. He must have brought me home,\" \"But who... how did he know... where to bring you?\" My voice broke and trailed to a whisper. \"I don't know, Mommy,\" Gigi said. \"But he was really friendly, and I wasn't scared of him at all.\" Just then Gigi noticed Gloria's picture on the mantle. \"That's him!\" She gave a loud cry, pointing at the picture. \"Mommy, the tail blond man dressed like an angel. That's the man that pulled me out of the car!\" I felt chill-bumps across my neck and arms. Gloria turned pale. \"Are you sure that's the man?\" Gloria asked. \"Yeah, that's him. Except he didn't have wings, and he was wearing blue jeans and a tee shirt. But that's him exactly. I'd remember him anywhere!\" Later that night, the police found the injured kidnappers in their damaged car fifty miles from our home. When questioned-the driver remembered making a sharp turn to avoid hitting a tall blond man and the backseat door that Gigi sat by had been completely torn off its hinges. Twenty years have gone by.

Thank God!\" I cried, throwing my arms around her, \"Where did those men take you? How did you get home? Did the police find you?\" \"No Mommy!\" said Gigi. \"I was really scared because those men said they were taking me far away. We were going really fast on an old rock road never seen before. But then a tall man walked out in front of the car, and they ran off the road and hit a tree.\" Then the tall man ran up and opened the car door and pulled me out.

For 15-year-old Ellie Wilson from London, going through the turbulent   period between childhood and adulthood is \"a pain\". However, she also enjoys happy times with friends, even though they have a lot of arguments. \"The thing about me and my friends is that one minute we're up and then the next we're down; one minute I want to shout the house down, the next I feel so happy that I just want to hug everyone in the room at once,\" she said to British paper The Independent. Wilson's generation have all the latest fashions and electronic equipment. But owning them does not necessarily make them happier. New research shows that it is the simple things in life that please us most. Close friends, playing sport and a stable   home life are more important to a teenager's happiness than the wealth of their parents, according to a study published this month by the Institute for Social and Economic Research at the University of Essex in Britain. Researcher Gundi Knies found families' incomes  didn't necessarily play a part in happiness. But happy children tend to  have their own bedroom, a bike or other leisure equipment. Children who have friends over for tea once a fortnight   and those who go swimming once a month were also happier with their lives than those who do not. A sense of belonging clearly had an influence on how satisfied people were. Children with lots of friends reported higher levels of happiness than those without. Children who live with both their parents were happier than those living in single families and step family relationships. Diet plays an important role too. Children who have fewer than five portions   of fruit and vegetables a day or who eat fast food most days tend to be less happy. The study also finds that girls make up both the happiest and least happy groups of children. \"Older girls are unhappier because they are going through puberty   and their parents become more protective. Girls also become very conscious   of the way they look and the way they are treated,\" Knies told UK newspaper The Observer. \"In general boys don't face the same pressures.\" Why are girls unhappier than boys during puberty?", "subject": ""}

The most widespread mistake of all is that colds are caused by cold.They are not.They are caused by viruses passing on from person to person.You catch a cold by coming into contact, directly or indirectly, with someone who already has one.If cold causes colds, it would be reasonable to expect the Eskimos to suffer from them forever.But they do not.And in isolated Arctic regions explorers have reported being free from colds until coming into contact again with infected  people from the outside world by way of packages and mail dropped from airplanes.        At the Common Cold Research Unit in England, volunteers took part in Experiments in which they gave themselves to the discomforts of being cold and wet for long stretches of time.After taking hot baths, they put on bathing suits, allowed themselves to be doused  with cold water, and then stood about dripping  wet in drafty  rooms.Some wore wet socks all day while others exercised in the rain until close to exhaustion.Not one of the volunteers came down with a cold unless a cold virus was actually dropped in his nose.        If cold and wet have nothing to do with catching colds, why are they more frequent in the winter? In spite of the most painstaking research, no one has yet found the answer.One explanation offered by scientists is that people tend to stay together indoors more in cold weather than at other times, and this makes it easier for cold viruses to be passed on.        No one has yet found a cure for the cold.There are drugs and pain suppressors such as aspirin, but all they do is to relieve the symptoms. What does the passage mainly discuss?", "subject": ""}

How's he get that in here? You wonder. Then you remember how much you paid for your snacks.      What invites the unwelcome outside food is probably the price. Why pay $5 for a bag of M&Ms when you can get them for a dollar at the corner store?      Earlier this year, a Michigan man decided to fight for his right to snack. Joshua Thompson is suing  his local theatre after it banned outside food. He argues the ban breaks a Michigan law that prevents business from charging extremely high prices. However, most legal  experts believe Thompson has little chance of winning his case though he does have a point: 85 percents out of every dollar of treats a movie theatre sells is pure profit  .       The truth is that movie theatres are more in the snack business than the movie business. A huge part of the ticket income goes to the Hollywood studio. This makes sense, since the studio have to pay the costs of movie production and advertising. But that often doesn't leave much cash for the theater, which also has its own running costs. If customers stopped buying food, owners would have to raise ticket prices even higher.       Of course, there's another reason to think twice before bringing food into the movies: It's against the rules. Breaking those rules can be unpleasant consequences, too.

The incident, captured by a surveillance camera and broadcast by Southern Television Guangdong (TVS),showed the two-year-old girl was knocked down and run over by a white van on a narrow market street on the afternoon of Oct.13,in Foshan City of Guangdong Province. The driver fled the scene of the accident,leaving the girl to bleed on the sidewalk.Over the next six minutes,more than a dozen people walked by the girl,yet not one individual did anything to help her.The girl was then hit a second time by another van before an elderly trash collector came to her aid and brought the attention of the girl's  mother,according to the video and eyewitnesses. Doctors said that the girl,who was put on life support after being hospitalized,remains in a deep coma.The girl's parents,who are migrants living in the city,are now with her. Police said the drivers of both vehicles have been arrested.However,the apathy of the bystanders shown in the video has shocked the public,as Internet forums have seethed with anger, and people are questioning the morality of society. High moral standards were once triumphed as national pride in China where individuals known for selflessly helping others were adored by the public. But in recent years,the perception of a decline of morals has become a hot topic as profit and materialism are perceived to be affecting society's values.

They have good reasons to stand alongside Pan. The latest round of haze reduced visibility to under 500 meters in many parts of the city. The smog has also led to a great increase in respiratory illnesses, particularly among children and the elderly. Anxious parents and doctors almost all blame the smoggy air for the illnesses. Though most schoolchildren are home for the winter holidays, the bad air can easily move indoors. Besides, ordinary medical masks fail to provide adequate protection, so some people have turned to gas masks and respirators . The causes of the scary smog are rather mysterious, though experts blame excessive emissions and the mountains around Beijing that trap pollution in winter, unless there is adequate wind to clear it away. Some critics have pointed fingers at China's top two oil firms, China National Petroleum Corp and China Petrochemical Corporation, saying the companies' outdated production technologies produce large quantities of substandard, high-polluting gas fuel.

Of course the common methods are always proper   diet and exercise, which not only work in weight loss but also keep a body healthy. Of course you've heard this before -- the challenge is to follow through. Others have lost weight by following these simple guidelines, and so can you.  Set small, practical goals. If you have a lot of weight to lose, try for 5 pounds, relax a bit and then go for 5 more.  Start a regular exercise program and  _ . Don't be afraid of those sweat suits and pants!  Do extra exercise in addition to your regular program. Park at the far end of the parking lot and walk; take the stairs instead of the lift.  Healthy foods are an important ingredient in losing weight. Eat low-fat, high-fiber foods such as salads and vegetable pastas. Choose foods that you like.

The airplane was built using only a computer--but it can fly at a speed of 100mph and has a two-meter wingspan. It was produced using a special nylon laser printer that builds up something layer-by-layer. The parts were made separately and attached using a \"snap fit\" technique so the aircraft could be put together without tools in minutes. No fasteners at all were used in the manufacture of the plane. Unmanned and electrically powered, the plane can travel in near silence and is also equipped with a small autopilot system. The special production process used is known as \"laser sintering \"and allows the designers to create shapes and structures that would normally include costly manufacturing techniques. This technology allows a highly-tailored aircraft to be developed from your own design to first flight in days, while using traditional materials and techniques would take months. And because no tooling is required for manufacture, major changes to the shape and scale of the aircraft can be made with no extra cost. Professor Jim Scanlon, who led the team, said, \"The process allows the design team to revisit historical techniques and ideas that would have been too expensive using traditional manufacturing.\" He added, \"This form of structure is very firm and lightweight, but very complex.

There are so many health and well-being products out there in the market promising many things. And although many may be true, select carefully. The basics of a healthy lifestyle is maintaining a balanced diet and doing regular exercise. By eating well, it means really to make sure you include plenty of vegetables and fruit preferably in season in your diet, avoid fried and junk foods and foods high in sugar as well as processed foods. Eating fresh homemade meals rather than ready-made meals which are high in salt and sugar is always the better option. Reducing alcohol intake, drinking plenty of water and supplementing your diet with healthy snacks like nuts and seeds. For external care choose natural skin care products and hair care oil. Natural beauty care involves using natural moisturizers like Argan oil, Coconut oil and Sweet Almond oil. These nourish the skin far more than counter creams full of chemicals. Skin reflects what we put inside of us, so a healthy diet with plenty of greens and healthy protein will make your skin brighter. Of course exercise is essential but the key is regular and consistent exercise. So walking three times a week for 45 minutes is much more beneficial than a binge workout once a week.

A man who lived on the Iberian Peninsula before Europeans became farmers probably had blue eyes but dark hair and skin,  according to scientists who have sequenced   his DNA. This surprising combination of eye, hair and skin color1ing may not have been unusual during his lifetime, but it is no longer seen among modern Europeans, reported by the journal Nature. The man, a Neolithic hunter-gatherer known to scientists as La BranaI, is of great interest to scientists because he offers a snapshot  of what was in Europeans' DNA before agriculture spread through the continent. Experts have theorized that certain genetic feature spread quickly among humans after they adopted the farming lifestyle. La BranaI shows that at least some of their predictions were correct. The man's skeleton, along with that of a male companion, was discovered in 2006 in a cave in what is now northeastern Spain. The site, known as La Brana-Arintero, sits about 5,000 feet above sea level, and the cave provided a cold, refrigerator-like environment that preserved his DNA. In the lab, scientists were able to remove enough DNA from a single tooth to reconstruct La BranaI's entire genome  .  They compared it to the DNA of other ancient Europeans (including Otzi, the 5, 300-year-old mummy found in an Alpine glacier) and determined that he was a closer match with hunter-gatherers than with farmers. When it came to genes that would influence La BranaI's appearance, the researchers found that their 7,OOO-year-old subject had versions of two skin pigment  genes that are either very rare or nonexistent among Europeans today. Then they looked at other places in the genome that influence pigmentation  and found a mix of ancient and modern gene variants . Taken together, La BranaI's DNA \"is likely to have resulted in dark skin pigmentation and dark or brown hair,\" they wrote. However, his DNA indicates that his eyes were most likely blue, the scientists found.This suggests that gene variants for light-color1ed eyes and skin did not spread together, they wrote, adding that La BranaI's combination \"of dark skin and non-brown eyes is unique and no longer present in contemporary European populations. \" Today, a blue-eyed person would typically have fair skin.

{"answer": 1, "choices": ["Fish can hear and see", "How clever is a fish?", "Fish can play tricks", "How scientists help fishermen."], "question": "Can a fish hear fishermen moving along the stream? What are the facts about the ability of a fish to see? Can they tell the difference between colors? The sharp hearing of a fish has been proved by two scientists, who trained a fish to expect its food when it heard the sound of a whistle. And a slight sound two hundred feet away could drive fishes away. That should make fishermen start thinking. One scientist had made experiments to prove fish can recognize different colors such as red, brown, yellow and green. Fish also have an eye for different shapes. One scientist proved this by teaching fish to connect certain patterns with food. He used a small circle and a square. If the fish swam towards the circle, they received food as a reward. If they swam towards the square, they received nothing. The fish learned in time to go to the circle but not to the square. Does this mean that in time fish might learn to leave alone all food on hooks that they have seen often before? Here is something for all fishermen to think about! These facts help to make more believable some of the \"believe it or not\" stories that have been told about fish. It is clear that fish have sometimes shown their ability to gain knowledge as man does. A good example of what we might call \"thinking\" by a fish is given by an experience of Dr. Andrew Gage. Fishing over a bridge, he hooked a fish. It struggled and dragged the line two hundred feet away before he stopped it. Then it swam back to the bridge. The clever fish then swam round a pile and, with a sudden push, broke the line. If the story ended there, one could say that the fish had freed itself by chance. However, Gage went on fishing. Below him he could see the fish that had broken loose. After another twenty minutes the fish again seized the food on the hook. This time it did not swim out but swam round one of the piles and again broke the line. Many stories are told of the fish that get away and the clever \"old hand\" ones that can't be caught. The more often a fish is nearly caught, the more difficult it will be to interest it next time. What's the best title of the passage?", "subject": ""}

Combining all the energy input totals for treatment and distribution, researchers found that producing bottled water requires between 5.6 and 10.2 million joules  of energy per liter, depending on transportation factors. That's up to 2, 000 times the energy required to produce tap water. To break down the energy requirements, researchers found that producing the plastic bottles and transporting the bottles greatly dominated  the energy input. Although some companies are experimenting with producing lightweight bottles or using recycled materials, the researchers calculated that the manufacturing cost is about 4 million joules of energy per plastic bottle weighing 38 grams, and the cap weighing 2 grams. \"Our previous work had suggested that bottled water production was an energy intensive process, but we were surprised to see the results, \" the researchers said.

{"answer": 0, "choices": ["An accompanying app.", "A necklace", "Computer keyboard.", "A remote control"], "question": "The vast majority of fitness trackers count your steps and are worn around the wrist, but now there's a device that's designed to be worn like a necklace and monitors tiny movements to improve your posture. The Fineck device aims to address neck pain by tracking tiny movement, spotting bad habits and suggesting exercises via an accompanying app. Made from silicone and titanium , Fineck monitors a wearer's movement, balance, posture and movement thanks to sensors inside. The Mountain View California-based firm says that a high percentage of people suffer from neck pain and associated problems, probably caused by more individuals doing office jobs, which generally involve leaning over computer keyboard. The device contains sensors, several different types of instruments to monitor movement, plus a monitor to shake. It connects to an IOS app via Bluetooth so that wearers can see their bad habits and play \"neck training\" games. The app warns of health risks and records a user's activity to build up a customer personal health description. The necklace shakes to give smart advice, such as reminding wearers to sit up straight. The app also allows users to set goals, like many other wearables do. \"Fineck is the first wearable device for your neck that tracks your neck activity and warn you when you are in a bad posture for too long. You can also exercise your neck with Fineck's interactive games.\" The company writes on Kickstarter. \"No matter where you are and what you are doing at office, on the go, or simply just feeling bored, Fineck will bring you enriched exercise experience through motion sensing games and therapies.\" It also claims that it is \"the world's first titanium wearable device\". The metal is widely used in fashion stuff that you can wear or carry to match your clothes because it is lightweight, durable and does not tend to cause allergic reactions. It also offers additional features such as shaking to indicate alerts on a user's smartphone, but it is not currently clear whether it can also be used like bands, to count steps, and so on. The Fineck has a battery life of around seven days and takes one hour to charge. It is available to pre-order via Kickstarter from $69(PS44)and is due to ship in March next year.

Most scientists agree that every modern house has some kind of indoor pollution, which can cause a person to feel tired, to suffer eye pain, headache and other problems. Believe it or not, some pollutants can cause breathing diseases of blood and even cancer. What made us feel relieved is that there's growing concern about the problem now. It is true that when builders began constructing houses and offices they did not want to waste energy. they built buildings that prevented or limited the flow of air between inside and outside. For the same purpose, man-made building materials were employed to build houses, which are now known to let out some harmful gases. Facing the serious challenge, scientists have been searching for a way to handle the problem. To everyone's delight, they discovered a natural pollution control system for building--green plants, though they do not really know how plants control air pollution. Scientists suppose that a plant's leaves absorb or take in the pollutants and in exchange gives out oxygen through its leaves and tiny organizations on its roots. Therefore they recommend that all buildings should have one large plant or several small plants inside for every nine square meters of space. Because studies indicate that different plants absorb different chemicals, the most effective way to clean the air is to use different kinds of plants.

The other wolf is full of anger.The smallest thing will set off his fiercest temper.He fights everyone, all the time, for no reason.He cannot think because his anger and hate are so much. It is helpless anger, for his anger will change nothing.This wolf represents fear, envy, greed, self-pity, guilt, lies, false pride and superiority.

She was their neighbor. Yet none of the 32 helped her. Not one even called the police. Was this in gunman cruelty? Was it lack of feeling about one's fellow man? Not so, say scientists John Barley and Bib Fatane. These men went beyond the headlines to probe  the reasons why people didn't act. They found that a person has to go through two steps before he can help. First he has to notice that is an emergency . Suppose you see a middle-aged man fall to the side-walk. Is he having a heart attack? Is he in a coma   from diabetes ? Or is he about to sleep off a drunk? Is the smoke coming into the room from a leak in the air conditioning? Is it steam pipes? Or is it really smoke from a fire? It's not always easy to tell if you are faced with a real emergency. Second, and more important, the person faced with an emergency must feel personally responsible. He must feel that he must help, or the person won't get the help he needs. The researchers found that a lot depends on how many people are around. They had college students in to be tested. Some came alone. Some came with one or two others. And some came in large groups. The receptionist started them off on the tests. Then she went into the next room. A curtain divided the testing room and the room into which she went. Soon the students heard a scream, the noise of file cabinets falling and a cry for help. All of this had been pre-recorded on a tape-recorder. Eight out of ten of the students taking the test alone acted to help. Of the students in pairs, only two out of ten helped. Of the students in groups, none helped. In other words, in a group, Americans often fail to act. They feel that others will act. They, themselves, needn't. They do not feel any direct responsibility.

{"answer": 2, "choices": ["Financial trouble in the family.", "Women's liberation movement.", "Different attitudes towards children's education.", "Lack of democratic atmosphere in the household."], "question": "In many homes, divorce is caused by the \"battle between the sexes.\" To understand the problem, one must remember that the modern American woman is freed. During childhood and adolescence , the American girl is given freedom and education which is equal to a boy's. After completing school, she is able to get a job and support herself. She doesn't have to marry for financial security. She considers herself an independent, self-sufficient person. She wants a husband whom she can respect, but she doesn't want to be dominated  by him. She wants a democratic household in which she has a voice in making decisions. When a husband and wife are able to share decisionmaking, their marriage is probably closer, stronger, and more satisfying. Otherwise, the couple is likely to wind up in the divorce court. When a couple gets divorced, the court usually requires the man to pay his former wife a monthly sum of money.

Emma had never read it,nor had she ever purchased a copy.But when she opened it up,she was  _ to see her own name and address inside the cover,in her own handwriting.It turned out that the summer before,at a concert back in Montreal,Emma had met a Californian who was in town visiting friends.They decided to exchange addresses,but neither of them had any paper.The man had opened up a book he was carrying in his backpack and asked Emma to write her name and address inside.When he returned to California,he left the book behind in Montreal,and his friend Alex kept it.When Alex later relocated to Jerusalem,he took the now-treasured book along. Then there was the time that my husband voluntarily answered the phone at my parents' house,something he has never done in more than a dozen years of visiting them almost every weekend.But this time he got up from the dinner table,without being asked,when the phone rang.He was gone for quite a while and was quite pale when he returned to the dining room.It was a wrong number,he told us,but he had recognized the voice.It was his estranged  sister,with whom he hadn't spoken in years.

The tiger, believed to have been hunting for a wild boar at the time, came face to face with several workers late in the afternoon on a forestry farm administered by the Dongfanghong Forestry Bureau (DFB) in the eastern part of the province, said an official with the provincial Forestry Industry Bureau. The farm is located on the scarcely populated Wandashan Mountain, where wild Siberian tigers have been spotted many times, but it was the first time for such an animal to come so close to human beings. \"We had just finished work in the forest when the tiger appeared.\" said Shi Chun, one of the workers who saw the tiger. Upon seeing the animal, the workers rushed to their tractor to avoid possible attacks. The tiger followed the tractor for several hundred meters before going away. The tiger remained mild throughout the encounter, and the workers even managed to snap a few photos of it. The pictures, though blurry due to the darkened sky, show a Siberian tiger with white hair in its face. Local authorities on Monday checked the site where the big cat was spotted and found plum-shaped paw prints, which they believe belong to a grown wild Siberian tiger. Yang Lijuan, a wild animal protection official with the DFB, said the forestry farm is a good site for wild animal reproduction. \"The farm is in a zone where coniferous and broad-leaved trees grow, which provides much food for the tigers' prey, such as a boar and deer.\" she said. Siberian tigers, otherwise known as Amur or Manchurian tigers, mainly live in eastern Russia, northeast China and the northern part of the Korean Peninsula. It is estimated that only about 500 currently live in the wild, with about twelve in Heilongjiang Province and eight to ten in neighboring Jilin Province.

The key to positive group behaviour,Levine explains,\"is building a sense of shared identity\".Action has to be decided quickly,Levine says.\"The longer you leave it,the harder it is to make a decision.If you don't immediately act then you kind of think'Well,actually I probably couldn't have done anything anyway'.\" But the people who took the initiative like Zoheb might make a difference.The cyclist ended up in hospital and the images of the collective effort might inspire others to more acts of unity.

Cholera is an illness caused by the bacterium. It produces a poison that causes a painless , watery diarrhea( )  that can quickly lead to severe dehydration  and death if treatment is not given. Most persons infected with cholera do not become ill, although the bacterium is present in their waste for 7-14 days. When this illness does strike, more than 90% of the time is not severe and is difficult to tell from other types of diarrhea. Less than 10% of sick persons develop cholera with signs of moderate or severe dehydration. A person may get cholera by drinking water or eating food polluted with the cholera bacterium. The disease can spread rapidly in areas without the proper treatment of drinking water. The cholera bacterium may also live in the environment in dirty rivers and coastal waters. Shellfish eaten raw have been a source of cholera. Therefore, the disease is not likely to spread directly from one person to another. Cholera can be simply and successfully treated by immediate replacement of the fluid and salts lost through diarrhea. Patients can be treated by being given a mixture of sugar and salt to be mixed with water and drunk in large amount. Antibiotics  shorten the course and decrease the severity of the illness.

Between December of 1811 and February of 1812, three major earthquakes occurred, all centered around the town of New Madrid, Missouri, on the Mississippi River. Property damage was severe. Buildings in the area were almost destroyed. Whole forests fell at once, and huge cracks opened in the ground,  releasing some strong smell chemicals. The Mississippi River itself completely changed character, developing sudden rapids and whirlpools  . Several times it changed its course, and once, according to some observers, it actually appeared to run backwards. Few people were killed in the New Marid earthquakes, probably simply because few people lived in the area in 1811; but the severity of the earthquakes are shown by the fact that the shock waves rang bells in church towers in Charleston, South Carolina, on the coast. Buildings shook in New York City, and clocks were stopped in Washington, D.C. Scientists now know that America's two major faults are essentially different. The San Andreas is a horizontal boundary between two major land masses that are slowly moving in opposite directions. California earthquakes result when the two masses make a sudden move. The New Madrid fault, on the other hand, is a vertical fault; at some points, possibly hundreds of millions of years ago, rock was pushed up toward the surface, probably by volcanoes under the surface. Suddenly, the volcanoes cooled and the rock collapsed, leaving huge cracks. Even now, the rock continues to settle downwards, and sudden sinking motions cause earthquakes in the region.

He and his team built a variety of household goods like ironing boards along with wooden toys. The Lego name was adopted in 1934, formed from the Danish words \"Leg Godt\" or \"play well\", which means \"I study\" or \"I put together\" in Latin. Christiansen's company continued to make wooden toys until 1942 when fire struck -- the entire Lego factory burned to the ground. Unwilling to give in, the factory was rebuilt and the production line restarted soon after. By 1954, Christiansen's son, Godtfred, had become the junior managing director of the Lego Group. It was during his conversation with an overseas buyer that he was struck by the idea of a toy system. For over 30 years, the Lego Company made only toys and related goods. Then, in 1968, the company opened its first Legoland in Denmark. Combining the Lego building bricks with a computer, the Robotics Invention System 1.5 is now the most advanced toy in the Lego Company, which is targeted at users aged twelve and above, and that includes any parents or grandparents that want to join in.

As usual, I liked being with friends and having fun. But I didn't like school much. I didn't like the rule of learning, studying, memorizing, etc. Too much work. As I got into high school, things changed for me. I started reading a lot of books. Books taught me about life and helped me learn about the world. I read around 30 books during each senior year. I learned to love reading then. Little did I know at that time that I would write books by myself. I've written 7 books since then. One book I wrote, Powerful Attitudes, was a huge success within a network marketing company in the USA. When I was 17 years old, I took about a dozen guitar lessons. I fell in love with guitar music no matter if it is blues, rock, flamenco or classical. I've attended concerts and have heard some great guitarists through the years.  Recently, I bought myself a piano and began to learn to play it. I've made great progress. My knowledge of music and playing guitar has helped me a lot in learning the piano. Last week, I employed a Chinese teacher to teach me Chinese. I've learned about 200 words in my first week. I'm inspired and motivated to learn. In fact, I feel a bit _ , thinking of learning Chinese. It's like a mountain I want to climb and conquer. I'm 56 years old and my love to learn it runs deep in my heart, mind and soul. What I certainly learned while growing up is to love learning. I never want to stop learning. I never want to stop studying people, life, processes and new things. I think the openness of admitting what you don't know, makes you a good learner. You never lie to yourself or to others about your knowledge and experience.

{"answer": 0, "choices": ["Lawyers.", "Farmers.", "Clerks.", "Shop assistants."], "question": "If you want to stay young, sit down and have a good think. This is the research finding of a team of Japanese doctors, who say that most of our brains are not getting enough exercise--and as a result, we are aging unnecessarily soon. Professor Taiju Matsuzawa wanted to find out why otherwise healthy farmers in northern Japan appeared to be losing their ability to think and reason at a relatively early age, and how the process of aging could be slowed down. With a team of colleagues at Tokyo National University, he set about measuring brain volumes of a thousand people of different ages and varying occupations. Computer technology enabled the researchers to obtain precise measurements of the volume of the front and side sections of the brain, which relate to intellect   and emotion, and determine the human character. (The rear section of the brain, which controls functions like eating and breathing, does not contract with age, and one can continue living without intellectual or emotional faculties.) Contraction of front and side parts--as cells die off--was observed in some subjects in their thirties, but it was still not evident in some sixty- and seventy-year-olds. Matsuzawa concluded from his tests that there is a simple remedy to the contraction normally associated with age--using the head.  The findings show in general terms that contraction of the brain begins sooner in people in the country than in the towns. Those least at risk, says Matsuzawa, are lawyers, followed by university professors and doctors. White collar workers doing routine work in government offices are, however, as likely to have shrinking brains as the farm worker, bus driver and shop assistant.    Matsuzawa's findings show that thinking can prevent the brain from shrinking. Blood must circulate properly in the head to supply the fresh oxygen the brain cells need. \"The best way to maintain good blood circulation is through using the brain,\" he says, \"Think hard and engage in conversation. Don't rely on pocket calculators.\" According to the passage, which people seem to age slower than the others?", "subject": ""}

In 1888, at Hawara in the El Faiyum area of Egypt, two-thousand-year-old roses were found in ancient tombs. The discovery suggested roses were an important part of the complex burial ceremony which took place when an important person died. The roses found in the tombs are thought by modern experts to be the oldest preserved flowers ever found in the world. They must have been cut and dried before flowering so that they would remain undamaged. Over the centuries, the roses had shrunk and became tight balls, but on careful examination it was discovered that the petals   themselves were hardly damaged.  Egypt's skill in mass-cultivation of roses in early times led to the flowers becoming an important export product. At the height of the Roman Empire, Egypt exported large quantities of roses to the Roman courts. Wealthy Romans loved the beautiful color1s and sweet smells of roses. So the Romans attempted to grow their own roses and they eventually mastered the art of mass cultivation. Egypt then decided to concentrate on growing grain instead of roses, so grain soon took over as the number-one agricultural product of Egypt.  Roses were appreciated in other early civilizations too, including Greece and Persia. They are a decorative feature on coins, sculpture, and vases dating back thousands of years. There is also evidence that roses were highly valued by the Chinese who believed that the flowers could be used to help treat a wide range of illnesses, from toothache to skin and chest diseases.  In the modern world, the rose has not lost its popularity as the \"Queen of Flowers\" -- the name given to it by the Greek poetess Sappho. Even today more roses are sold than any other flower. Modern techniques have enabled people to create ever more beautiful roses. Transportation by air makes it possible to grow roses in countries with favorable climates and sell them within twenty-four hours in profitable markets all over the world.

Using microwaves to directly heat owners of a room would save much of the energy wasted by heating walls and furniture. And despite popular ideas about microwaves, this technique would be safe, according to Charles R. Burlier of the Microwave Research Center in Marlborough, New Hampshire. Low-power microwaves only penetrate   the skin (low-power microwave penetration in a ham is about 0.2 inches, for example) and with no negative effects. To test this idea, Buffler subjected himself to microwaves in a special room using a standard 500-watt, 2459 MHz magnetron  . He found that a person will start to feel warmth at about 20 milliwatts per square centimeter (mw. / sq. cm. ) ; a satisfactory feeling of warmth occurs between 35 and 50mw. / sq. cm. By comparison, a person standing in noonday summer sun feels the amount of 85 mw. / sq. cm. And a frozen meat pie in your microwave oven receives about 1000 mw. / sq. cm. In houses of the future, each room could be provided with its own magnetron, says Buffler. When you stepped into the living room, for example, a motion detector  would turn on the magnetron, filling the room with low-power microwaves. In the same way that a microwave oven heats up a hamburger, but not the plate it's on, you would feel warmth from the microwaves without changing the temperature of your coffee table.

While it might be some time before homeowners are comfortable enough with the idea to set up whole-body microwave heaters in houses, Buffler says microwaves may attract livestock  farmers.

There exists a social and cultural disconnect between journalists and their readers, which helps explain why the \"standard patterns\" of the newsroom seem alien to many readers. In a recent survey, questionnaires were sent to reporters in five middle-size cities around the country, plus one large metropolitan area. Then residents in these communities were phoned at random and asked the same questions. Replies show that compared with other Americans, journalists are more likely to live in upscale neighborhoods, have maids, own Mercedes, and trade stocks, and they're less likely to go to church, do volunteer work, or put down roots in a community.

Sad to say, this project has turned out to be mostly low-level findings about factual errors and spelling and grammar mistakes, combined with lots of head-scratching puzzlement about what in the world those readers really want. But the sources of distrust go way deeper. Most journalists learn to see the world through a set of standard patterns into which they plug each day's events. In other words, there is a conventional story line in the newsroom culture that provides a backbone and a ready-made narrative structure for otherwise confusing news. There exists a social and cultural disconnect between journalists and their readers, which helps explain why the \"standard patterns\" of the newsroom seem alien to many readers. In a recent survey, questionnaires were sent to reporters in five middle-size cities around the country, plus one large metropolitan area. Then residents in these communities were phoned at random and asked the same questions. Replies show that compared with other Americans, journalists are more likely to live in upscale neighborhoods, have maids, own Mercedes, and trade stocks, and they're less likely to go to church, do volunteer work, or put down roots in a community. Reporters tend to be part of a broadly defined social and cultural elite, so their work tends to reflect the conventional values of this elite. The surprising distrust of the news media isn't rooted in inaccuracy or poor reportorial skills but in the daily clash of world views between reporters and their readers. This is an explosive situation for any industry, particularly a declining one. Here is a troubled business that keeps hiring employees whose attitudes vastly annoy the customers. Then it sponsors lots of symposiums and a credibility project dedicated to wondering why customers are annoyed and fleeing in large numbers. But it never seems to get around to noticing the cultural and class biases that so many former buyers are complaining about. If it did, it would open up its diversity program, now focused narrowly on race and gender, and look for reporters who differ broadly by outlook, values, education, and class.

Rose Bengal was first used in the early 1900s as a dye for food, textiles and cosmetics. But now it is proving to be a useful weapon in the fight against skin cancer. Television advertisements constantly warn of the dangers of overexposure to the fierce sun. Among them is the possibility of the disease melanoma , a type of skin cancer. More than 1,200 Australians die every year from the disease. Initial trials of a solution of Rose Bengal injected into some melanoma cells have had a 75 percent success rate in controlling the disease. Professor John Thompson, the director of the Melanoma Unit at the University of Sydney, says this organic dye could become a powerful cancer-fighting treatment. \"We believe it works by getting into the tumor  cells and causing them to self-destruct.

{"answer": 1, "choices": ["Farmers benefit a lot from the price increase.", "Price increase has not helped farmers.", "We should be sorry for farmers.", "Price increase has a bad effect on economy."], "question": "Nowadays, the increase in the prices of agricultural products is one of the greatest concerns of the people and the government. The government has announced a series of policies  to prevent the prices from rising further. Rising housing prices is still a big concern for the people, but since farm products are needed every day, the increase in their prices has made life very difficult for them. Many people may think the increase will help farmers. But have higher prices of farm products really benefited the farmers? Take the increase in vegetable prices in the first half of this year for example. Though natural disasters such as droughts and spring frost did not cause the prices of farm products to increase greatly--in fact, prices of some products did not increase at all--vegetables have become dearer by as much as 20 percent compared to that of last year. This means only a small part (or even none) of the extra money that city people have paid to buy farm products has gone to the farmers. The extra cost actually has gone to middlemen. As the fact shows, just increasing prices of farm products will have negative influence on the entire economy. On one hand, the price increase has created some abnormal phenomena, which hurts farmers' interests. On the other hand, resources will enter the agriculture because of the high price of farm products, which would finally create negative effect on the whole economy. In such a case, it would be better to leave the market to decide the prices instead of raising farm products' prices to protect the interests of farmers.

The paper by Professor Eric Bickel and Lee Lane looked into the costs of the projects. It found that cloud whitening would reduce the effects of climate change this century for no more than PS5.3 billion. This is only a small part of the PS150 billion that leading nations are considering spending to cut CO2 emissions   each year. It is also more than 25 times cheaper than the PS140 billion cost of another project which would copy the cooling effect of volcanoes.  The authors also compared the cost benefits that reducing temperatures would have. They found every PS1 spend on other ways would have PS15 of benefits, however every PS1 spent on cloud whitening would bring PS2,000 of benefits. These would include the human costs on health and the influence on other fields.  David Young said, \"Marine cloud whitening could achieve as much for the planet as CO2cuts would, but with much less cost.\" But he warned that these techniques shouldn't be considered as a long-period way to deal with climate change. \" It's important to note that this technique wouldn't reduce CO2emissions or deal with the causes of global warming, but would cover its effects.\" he said.

Will computers become smarter than us? Not likely. But here are some things that scientists say are most likely to happen 10 to 30 years later from now, according to the BBC. 1.Digital money We used to pay with cash for everything we bought. Now when we swipe  our bus pass or use a credit card to shop online, money is spent without us even seeing it. In fact, we are already using one type of digital money. You have to admit that using a card is much easier than searching your pockets for change. It is also safer than carrying a lot of cash. When ATM cards were first introduced, they were not accepted everywhere. But now it's hard to live without them. People in Sweden completely stopped using cash last year, according to the Associated Press, and the US might be next. 2.Bionic eye It's no longer something only in a scifi movie. People who are blind may have a chance to get their sight back--by wearing bionic eyes. A blind eye can no longer sense light, but a bionic eye can use a camera to \"see\" the environment and send data directly to the brain. Although the bionic eye that's out now only allows patients to see lights and unclear shapes, a highresolution  version could be just a few years away. 3.Selfdriving cars Everything is going automatic these days--washing machines, ticket selling machines and even cars. Unlike a human driver, a selfdriving car won't get _ by a phone call, the radio or something outside the window. Sensors and cameras on the car would allow it to stick strictly to the rules of the road and keep a safe distance from other cars. This would greatly reduce the number of road accidents. You could even take a nap while the car drives itself. Many vehicle companies are now planning selfdriving cars. \"By 2040, driverless vehicles will be widely accepted and possibly be the dominant vehicles on the road,\" said Jeffrey Miller, professor at the University of Alaska Anchorage, US, in Wired magazine.

The authorities are doing their best to arise the public awareness of the vital importance of the environmental protection. This issue is, indeed, worth following up.     Environmental protection is closely related not only to our personal life, but also to the entire human race and the world's further development. For one thing, the environment, in a narrow sense, determines the quality of our individual life. The air we breathe, the water we drink, the food we eat, etc. , all come directly from the environment. If they continue to be contaminated, we may have neither clean water, nor healthy food. For another thing, in a broader sense, the environment plays a decisive role in fate of mankind. As is known to all, the earth, up to now, is human being's only dwelling place. We can expect that some day we will live on another planet, but I doubt that this day will come earlier than the day when the earth becomes a globe of waste, if we keep damaging the environment. Finally, the environment is essential to the further development of the world. Extensive industrialization, which has brought about all the convenience and facilities we enjoy today, has been depending on the comprehensive exploitation of the earth's natural resources found in the environment. If we do not protect the environment properly, further development cannot be guaranteed. In a word, to protect the environment is an urgent task.

But my friend could perfectly correctly reply, \"No, you don't! You can't.\" In truth we can communicate how strongly we feel, but we cannot communicate exactly what we feel. But if we come from the same linguistic and cultural background, the match can be close enough. Culture and language cannot be separated, and I think that we have the feelings that are recognized in our culture and therefore represented in our language. One might say that we feel the things that our language allows us to express. So when it comes to trying to explain feelings to someone of a different mother tongue, the difficulties are huge. I could not explain to my friend how I felt about her not letting me repay her, because Chinese culture, it seems, does not recognize the same feelings on such occasions.

Sir Joseph Banks was among the brave. In 1760, he collected vast quantities of plants in what is now known as Australia. None of these plants had been recorded by Europeans before. However, Banks was not able to bring those plants back to Europe and let them grow in his homeland because keeping plants alive during long land or sea voyages was a great challenge at that time. Large numbers of seeds failed to grow after long sea voyage or trips across land far away from Europe. In 1833 the invention of the Wardian case, a tightly sealed portable glass container, made it possible for two cases of British plants to survive the six-month journey to Australia.

Three decades later, the local government is pouring funds into the tourism sector. Ancient monuments and museums are being restored, and various copies of Buddhist and Tang heritage are being constructed to help Chinese tourists rediscover their national heritage. One of those ancient monuments is the Big Wild Goose Pagoda-Xi'an's most sacred   monument-which was built in 652 by the monk Xuanzang ,who travelled across India for 18 years and returned with a precious collection of Buddhist sacred texts. In 1966,the Red Guards burnt the pagoda's scriptures, silk wall hangings and other relics in a bonfire that raged all night. But that destruction has largely been forgotten as tourists flock to the newly restored pagoda. The only original remainders-the empty shell of the seven-storey pagoda-light up at night, standing out in the city's skyline. Xi'an is also displaying the glories of the ancient Tang Dynasty, with a 165-acre Tang Paradise Theme Park that is visited by flocks of tourist groups.

You know, you would be submerged   in crowds of tourists and lose lots of opportunities to get familiar with the country more closely. We started to think over our trip and managed to come up with a free tour of Italy. The trip was not very long but it was still very impressive. We look forward to going there again! Of course, we spent lots of time arranging the trip, but it was well worth it! Of course I was afraid that something would go wrong and I was especially anxious about my visa, but everything went quite smoothly in the end. ks5u  The most difficult part was getting a visa without an invitation. In the Italian consulate , one must hand in some official paper proving that one has a hotel booked for oneself in order to get the visa. Then we had to solve the ticket problem. Airlines often sell cheap tickets and we bought ours far in advance. The next step was to book a hotel. We finally booked a hotel about thirty km away from the heart of Rome and it was the perfect choice for our trip.  Every day we took a train that carried us to the heart of Rome. Our big house, which was surrounded by the forest, was a rare girl for the fresh air and   silence, beautiful views, hospitable   hosts, comfortable living conditions delighted us to no end. Besides this, we were very lucky that our mistress was Russian. She gave us a lot of advice that was of great use. She told us what transport to choose and where the best places to go.  Don't be afraid to arrange your trip by yourself. It's not difficult! The only thing I'll say right now is that we really enjoyed traveling by ourselves. We walked with a map and a guide-book to wherever we wanted and we even met some of our fellow countrymen on the way just two or three times.

But on the Moscow Metro, taking the subway is like walking through a national heritage site. Depending on where you get off,you'll receive a brief course in architectural movements and face colorful glass windows, marble columns, gilded  mosaics and painted scenes from Russian history. \"These extraordinarily beautiful places are unlike any metro station I've ever seen,\" says Vancouver-based photographer David Burdeny. When Burdeny, who himself has a master's degree in architecture, first found out about Moscow's metro stations, he was struck by the work of art.

It is undeniable that some young people do need to be educated on mutual   respect and concern for others, especially senior members of society. But we older people should have some understanding about the young, too. Today's society is rather different from what it was when we were young. The social, financial and psychological pressure today's young people have to face is much higher than what we did back in the 1950s through the 1990s.   They are in the early stage of their career. They have to find proper jobs to support themselves and work hard to rise. They have to live in smaller houses, because they are unable to afford the rising housing prices. Considering these facts, we may find it understandable why young people sometimes appear aloof   and disrespectful. I don't mean that we should put up with it without reminding them of the need to mend their ways. What I mean is that we should be more patient, understanding and tolerant toward them.  For instance, when we get up on a bus or a subway train, we should not complain about not being offered a seat. A young person does not offer a senior citizen his/her seat probably because he/she has to travel a long way to work or because the carriage is too crowded for one to move at all.  In fact, young people do offer their seats to the seniors. I seldom take a bus or a subway train, but more than a quarter of the times I have done so, I was offered a seat. That is fair enough, considering that I do not look so old. But on occasions, I have seen old people not showing any sign of gratitude when offered a seat.   China has become an aging society since the end of the last century. According to a recent survey, people older than 60 accounted for 11.4 percent of the nation's population.

In other words, the younger generations will have to shoulder a heavier burden in looking after the parents and grandparents.
