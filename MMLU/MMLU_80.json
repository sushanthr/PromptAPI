In a new programme \"Colour me Healthy\", Verity looks at the ways that colours can influence how hard we work and the choices we make. They can even change our emotions and even influence how healthy we are. \"Have you ever noticed how people always use the same colours for the same things?\" says Verity. \"Our toothpaste is always white or blue or maybe red. It's never green. Why not? For some reason we think that blue and white is clean, while we think of green products as being a bit unpleasant. It's the same for businesses. We respect a company which writes its name in blue or black, but we don't respect one that uses pink or orange. People who design new products can use these ideas to influence what we buy.\" During the programme, Verity studies eight different colours, two colours in each part. She meets people who work in the colour industry, from people who design food packages, to people who name the colours of lipsticks. Some of the people she meets clearly have very little scientific knowledge to prove their ideas, such as the American \"Colour Doctor\" who believes that serious diseases can be treated successfully by the use of coloured lights. However, she also interviews real scientists who are studying the effects of green and red lights on mice, with some surprising results. Overall, it's an interesting show, and anyone who watches it will probably find out something new.

{"answer": 2, "choices": ["Rising food prices.", "Growing population.", "Fewer skillful farmers.", "Less fresh water available"], "question": "With rising food prices, growing population and environmental problems, many people are worrying about how we will feed ourselves in the future. Don't worry. Scientists are trying to find some answers. Some scientists believe insects will become a staple of our diet. Insects provide as many nutrients as ordinary meat and a great source of protein  , they also cost less to raise than cows and use less water. About 1,400 species are suitable as food for humans. Many people have already eaten insects as a part of their diet. Locusts are popular in Africa, wasps are a dish in Japan, and crickets are eaten in Thailand. The Dutch government is preparing for insect farms and has invested one million euros into research. In the future, land and fresh water will be in short supply. It is possible that people need to find a reliable food source in the ocean. Scientists have already found one at the bottom of the food chain---seaweed. It has long been a staple in Asia, and countries including Japan have huge seaweed farms. Such farms can easily work in other countries and be very successful. The great thing about seaweed is that it grows at an amazing rate. It's the fastest growing plant on earth. Scientists are also working in the lab to solve the problem of food shortage. A few years ago, European scientists successfully produced lab meat, also known as cultured meat. They grew muscle tissue using stem cells taken from cows. The experiment was funded by NASA to see if lab meat was a food astronauts could eat in space. In 20 years' time , lab meat is likely to become a popular dish of our diet. According to research, growing meat in a lab rather than slaughtering  animals can greatly reduce greenhouse gases, along with energy and water use. People can also reduce fat from the meat and add nutrients. According to the passage, which of the following is NOT a potential problem humans face in the future?", "subject": ""}

There are many different kinds of heroes, but they all seem to have two things in common. First, heroes, by their actions, show the great possibilities of human nature. Second, heroes can also stand the test of time, and their achievements will not be easily forgotten. Because of these good points, we need to choose our heroes carefully. Olympic sports star Jackie Joyner-Kersee, who is believed to be a hero, warns young people to be careful of making athletes heroes. She hopes that if someone tries to copy her, it will be because she has achieved her goals by working hard. Joyner-Kersee says that a hero should be someone who has an influence on another person's life. Poet Maya Angelou believes that a hero encourages people to treat others well and to be concerned about the greater good. A hero should show politeness, courage, patience, and strength all the time. A hero should encourage others to follow him with actions that improve the world, even if only in small ways.

Next year she is going to university to study Chinese, but now she's living in Belize. Pauline says, \"I'm working with other people here to save the coral reefs   in the sea near Belize. The reefs here are beautiful, but if the sea water is very polluted, the coral will die. I'm helping to do research on the coral and the fish that live around the reefs. All over the world, coral reefs are dying. We need to do something about the problem before it's too late.\" \"I'm staying with a family here and I help do some housework. I don't get any money, but that's OK. I love my work here, and I'm learning a lot about the people of Belize--and myself! After I finish my work, I want to stay here for another three months.

I'm a bit nervous as I've never made a speech before to so many people, so please forgive me if it shows! www.xkb1.com As we all know, this is the school leavers' party, and it's time to say goodbye to everyone. We're sorry to leave you at the end of our junior high school education, and we promise that we'll never forget the happy times we have spent in these buildings with you all. I'd like to thank three groups of people for the three things I've learnt while I've been a pupil at our school. The three things are friendship, love and knowledge. The first group is my friends, and what I've learnt is the importance of friendship. We've worked hard together, we've even shared some difficult times together, but we've also had a lot of fun. Many of us will go to new schools and we may not see each other so often in the future. Others will go on to senior high school and continue their close friendships. But friends don't have to see each other all the time. Sometimes the friends you treasure most are the friends you see less often. A life without old friends is like a day without sunshine. We'll always stay in touch. The second group is our parents and grandparents. We thank you for the love you have shown us during our years at junior high school, for making a home where we feel both safe and relaxed, and where we can prepare ourselves for our school days. We also thank you for your help with our homework. How many of us owe our good grades to the suggestions you have made during those long evenings? And finally, the third group is our teachers. We can never pay you back for your kindness, your patience, and gift of knowledge which you have offered us; sometimes you've made us work very hard. But you have always been fair and you'll always be our role models. There's a saying from Ireland which is a favourite of mine: Strangers are only friends you haven't met yet.

But are everybody's dreams the same? Here are some of the findings of a survey about hopes and dreams,and thousands of students across China took part in it.  _  We received several different answers to the question:What would you like to do after finishing your education? It seems some students would like to start work as soon as possible, so that they can help provide better lives for their parents. Other students hope to continue studying after finishing school and to go to university. Although money is important, many teenagers said they want to do jobs they enjoy. According to the survey, the most popular choice of job is computer programming.  _  Teenagers have all kinds of dreams. Some are more realistic  than others. For example, many students said they would like to be volunteers if Beijing could hold the World Cup, maybe working as translators or tour guides. And quite a few said they dream of going to the moon one day. According to the survey, less realistic dreams are also common, but many students reported that they were willing to work hard to achieve their dreams.

{"answer": 2, "choices": ["visited", "met", "made a telephone call to", "found"], "question": "\"Would you tell me which way I should go from here?\" asked Alice. \"That depends a good deal on where you want to get,\" said the Cat. \"I really don't care where\" replied Alice. \"Then it doesn't much matter which way you go,\" said the Cat. --- from \" Alice in Wonderland \" My name is David. And I have a brother called Mike. One day, my brother called me and asked me for some advice. He was trying to decide between two job offers: Job 1 - The first job was your typical 40 hour a week \"office\" job. Job 2 - The second job was more of a career in the insurance industry , where he would start at the bottom, and after many years and many long hours eventually rise to the top (if he was good). The second job did not pay as well as the first job (at the beginning), but the pay-off of the second job (in the future) was much greater than the first job. So which job should my brother take? Well the answer is...it depends. Just like the Cat was trying to tell Alice, which road you take depends a great deal on where you want to end up. Begin with the End in Mind I asked my brother what was his life's purpose. He said his purpose was to \"teach,\" but he wanted to make a lot of money first. I told my brother to forget about the money, and I advised him to focus on his purpose. I then asked him which job best supported his end result of \"teaching.\" He said the first job best supported his goal because he would only have to work 40 hours a week, which would give him spare time to teach. He continued on to say, \"but if I take job number two, I can work hard and make more money, then I can retire early and \"teach\" later in life.\" I again advised him to \"focus\" on his purpose, not money.

{"answer": 0, "choices": ["Independent grown-ups.", "Married people.", "People who can drive.", "People in the army."], "question": "Some children cannot wait to grow up. Because once you become an adult, you are free to make your own decisions. More importantly, you can do all those things that you cannot do now because you are too young. So, the question is, 'At what age do you really become an adult?' Well, people become adults at different ages in different places. In Australia, the 18th birthday is a very important event for young Australians because it means they can do almost anything they want. They can vote, learn to drive a car, get married, join the army and even buy their own houses. However, even if they can do all these things, most Australians have to wait until their 21st birthday to really celebrate becoming an adult. This is the traditional adult age not only in Australia, but also in the USA and the UK. It is their first year of true independence  .Traditionally, people were given a key to their houses by their parents when they turned 21, meaning they could come and go as they like. Even though 21 is the traditional adult age in many English-speaking countries, the law nowadays is different in each country. In the UK, you can join the army at 16 and even get married at 16 if your parents allow. Young people in the UK can learn to drive a car at 17 as in Australia, although they have to wait until they are 18 to vote. In China, there is a different age for each of the stages of becoming an adult. You can vote and learn to drive a car when you are 18, but if you want to get married, women have to wait until they are 20 and men until they are 22. Chinese people celebrate important birthdays every 10 years--so when young people turn 20, they can expect a big party!

They can vote, learn to drive a car, get married, join the army and even buy their own houses. However, even if they can do all these things, most Australians have to wait until their 21st birthday to really celebrate becoming an adult. This is the traditional adult age not only in Australia, but also in the USA and the UK. It is their first year of true independence  .Traditionally, people were given a key to their houses by their parents when they turned 21, meaning they could come and go as they like. Even though 21 is the traditional adult age in many English-speaking countries, the law nowadays is different in each country. In the UK, you can join the army at 16 and even get married at 16 if your parents allow. Young people in the UK can learn to drive a car at 17 as in Australia, although they have to wait until they are 18 to vote. In China, there is a different age for each of the stages of becoming an adult. You can vote and learn to drive a car when you are 18, but if you want to get married, women have to wait until they are 20 and men until they are 22. Chinese people celebrate important birthdays every 10 years--so when young people turn 20, they can expect a big party! No matter what age you are, becoming an adult is really about learning how to be independent and responsible . Once you are finally able to take care of yourself and make your own decisions, then you can say that you are truly all grown-ups.

Each story is different. Some are detailed and others are simple. Some have a beginning, middle and end but others don't have clear ends. Some are true but others not. Yet all those things do not really matter. What matters to the storyteller is that the story is heard -- without interruption  or judgment . It was that woman who taught me the importance of stopping, sitting down and truly listening. And, not long after, in an unexpected accident, I became a patient. 20 years later, I sit all the time -- in a wheelchair. For as long as I could, I continued to see patients from my chair. I believe in the power  of listening. Which statement is NOT right according to the passage?", "subject": ""}

Over the last few years, heavy rains have caused floods   in Brazil, Pakistan, and Thailand. Droughts   have struck Russia and Australia. Heat waves have killed thousands in Europe. There are more different kinds of terrible wild weather all over the world. In 2011 alone, the bad weather caused the world to lose 150 billion dollars.

Many also want to know: Is this natural, or are we to blame  ? The answer seems to be: a little of both. Wild weather is natural. _ This global   warming makes heat waves more likely to happen. The higher temperatures also cause more water to enter the air. This causes much more rain. Some scientists also believe global warming makes some storms stronger. This means we're likely to see more wild weather. \"But we don't have to just stand there and take it,\" says Scientist Michael Oppenheimer.

{"answer": 2, "choices": ["ways of being more intelligent", "differences between men and women", "studies on brains between two sexes", "studies on white matter and grey matter"], "question": "Do you know that women's brains are smaller than men's? Normally the women's brain weighs 10% less than men's. Since research has shown that the bigger the brain, the cleverer the animal, men must be more intelligent  than women. Right? Wrong. Men and women always score similarly on intelligence tests, despite the difference in brain size. Why? After years of study, researchers have concluded that it's what's inside that matters, not just the size of the brain. The brain is made up of \"grey matter\" and \"white matter\". While men have more of the white matter, the amount of \"thinking\" brain is almost the same in both men and women. It has been suggested that smaller brain appears to work faster, perhaps because the two sides of the brain are better connected in women. This means that little girls may learn to speak earlier, and that women can understand sorts of different information at the same time. When it comes to talking to the boss on the phone, cooking dinner and keeping an eye on the baby all at the same time, it's women who come out on top every time. There are other important differences between two sexes . As white matter is the key to spatial tasks, men know better where things are in relation to other things. \"A great footballer always knows where he is in relation to the other players, and he knows where to go,\" says one researcher. That may explain one of life's great mysteries: why men refuse to ask for directions ... and women often need to! The differences begin when fetuses are about nine weeks old, which can be seen in the action of children when they are very young. A boy would try to climb a barrier before him or push it down while a girl would ask for help from others. These brain differences also explain the fact that more men take up jobs that require good spatial skills, while more women speech skills. It may all go back to our ancestors, among whom women needed speech skills to take care of their babies and men needed spatial skills to hunt, according to one research.

Suddenly Susan said, \"I'll be right back. Please wait for me a minute. \" I watched curiously   as she went across to the hot dog stand. Then I realized what she was doing. She bought a hot dog, crossed back, and gave the man the food. When she came back to us, Susan said simply,  \"I was just passing on the kindness that someone gave to me. \" That day I learned how _ can go farther than the person you give to. By giving, you teach others how to give also. You never know what happiness a simple act of care will bring. What does the writer want to tell us by telling us the story?", "subject": ""}
