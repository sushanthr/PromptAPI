It challenges   the belief that short-sightedness is caused by computer use, watching TV or reading in weak light.

In all, 30% of the Singaporean children were short-sighted--this rate  was ten times higher than Australian children. Both groups spent a similar amount of time reading, watching television and playing computer games.

To get to 40,000 decimal places it took me about ten years.\" Unluckily for Mr. Tomoyori, his record was broken in 1995, when another Japanese man, Mr. Goto, memorized pi to 42,195 places. Who remembered the greatest numbers according to the passage?", "subject": ""}

{"answer": 2, "choices": ["a strange light", "a blue whale", "a mysterious island", "a mountain"], "question": "The shock of the recent earthquake in Pakistan has brought another shock: the rise of a small, mysterious island, coming out from the water. In the aftershock of the earthquake, people living in Gawadar, near the southwest coast, began to see a strange sight. They looked out into the Arabian Sea and saw a mountain-like shape coming out of the water. \"I could see this gray, dome-shaped   body in the distance, like a giant whale,\" Bahram Baloch, a local journalist, told the BBC. \"Hundreds of people had gathered to watch it in disbelief  .\" So what happened? The earthquake measured 7.7 in magnitude  . The force was so strong that it moved the sea floor, releasing gas. This gas pushed the seabed, mostly rock and sand, upward and out of the water. This is how mud volcanoes   are formed. The island that measures about 20 meters high, 30 meters long and 90 meters wide is actually the tip of the mud volcano. Is it safe? Although people have visited this new island, scientists have found dangerous gas coming from the newly formed island. \"Our team found bubbles rising from the surface of the island, which caught fire when a match was lit,\" said Mohammad Danish, a scientist, to Universe Today. These mud volcanoes are not rare. But it's striking because this one has popped up in a populated   area, and not far out in the sea. However, it's not expected to last very long. Most of these mud volcanoes are swept back under the sea within one year. After the earthquake, what did people see in the sea?", "subject": ""}

Many billionaires  have done similar things,for example,Bill Gates.But giving back and helping others isn't just for big billionaires.People like Zuckerberg and Gates may have more to give,but people with less are doing it too.Especially around the holidays,people want to do their part and give back to people who are less lucky than them.Schools may have food collections where people bring some food and together they can give away some other things to places like homeless centers. People also host special events like concerts or runs to be creative while raising money.Common people give away whatever they can to US charities like the United Way and the American Red Cross. Then these charities are able to help the poor in different ways like education,health and improving their lives.These things come together to make a big difference. What can we learn from the story?", "subject": ""}

{"answer": 0, "choices": ["The man-made noises.", "The noises made by themselves.", "The sound of earthquakes.", "The sound of the ice-breaking."], "question": "Some scientists say that animals in the ocean are increasingly threatened  by noise pollution caused by human beings. The noise that affects sea animals comes from a number of human activities. Such noises are added to natural sounds. These sounds include the breaking of ice fields, underwater earthquakes, and sounds made by animals themselves. Decibels  measured in water are different from those measured on land. A noise of one hundred and twenty decibels on land caused pain to human ears. In water, a decibel level of one hundred and ninety-five would have the same effect. Some scientists have planned to set a noise limit of one hundred and twenty decibels in oceans. They have found that noises at that level can frighten and confuse  whales. A team of American and Canadian scientists discovered that loud noises can seriously hurt some animals. The research team found that powerful underwater explosions were causing whales in the area to lose their hearing. This seriously affected the whales' ability to exchange information and find their way. Some of the whales even died. The explosions had caused their ears to bleed and become infected. Many researchers whose work depends on ocean sounds disagree to a limit of one hundred and twenty decibels. They say such a limit would mean an end to important industrial and scientific research.

{"answer": 3, "choices": ["They will try their best to make no noise.", "They will work hard to cut down natural noises.", "They will study the effect of different noises.", "They will protect animals from harmful noises."], "question": "Some scientists say that animals in the ocean are increasingly threatened  by noise pollution caused by human beings. The noise that affects sea animals comes from a number of human activities. Such noises are added to natural sounds. These sounds include the breaking of ice fields, underwater earthquakes, and sounds made by animals themselves. Decibels  measured in water are different from those measured on land. A noise of one hundred and twenty decibels on land caused pain to human ears. In water, a decibel level of one hundred and ninety-five would have the same effect. Some scientists have planned to set a noise limit of one hundred and twenty decibels in oceans. They have found that noises at that level can frighten and confuse  whales. A team of American and Canadian scientists discovered that loud noises can seriously hurt some animals. The research team found that powerful underwater explosions were causing whales in the area to lose their hearing. This seriously affected the whales' ability to exchange information and find their way. Some of the whales even died. The explosions had caused their ears to bleed and become infected. Many researchers whose work depends on ocean sounds disagree to a limit of one hundred and twenty decibels. They say such a limit would mean an end to important industrial and scientific research. Scientists do not know how much and what kinds of noises are harmful to ocean animals. However, many scientists suspect  that noise is a greater danger than they believed. They want to stop noises from harming creatures in the ocean. According to the passage, what will scientists most probably do in the future?", "subject": ""}

Players are known as \"the boys of summer\" because people often play the sport mostly in warm months. You don't need to be of a certain size or shape to play baseball. You don't have to be tall like a basketball player or strong like an American footballer. You just need to want to have fun. Baseball is not as fast-paced   a game as basketball. But when you go to see a game, there's time to relax, talk and get to know other people. Baseball may not be the most popular sport in the US, but it is the most traditional. It's not just a game any more, but an important part of American culture, like apple pie and grandma's house. Which one is WRONG in the article?", "subject": ""}

The first article will look at the way fast food is leading to obesity  . The famous cook, Jamie Oliver, has made it his purpose to introduce ideas about healthy eating. In a speech, Jamie Oliver told the world that during the 18 minutes that he gave his speech, four Americans would die because of the food that they ate! Obesity is also a growing problem in China. As China Daily reported in February, the number of obese people under the age of 18 in China has reached 120 million. Jamie has worked for 10 years to try and fight this problem.

{"answer": 3, "choices": ["introduce yourself", "learn about the school rules", "make new friends", "go over your new lessons"], "question": "It's school time again! You're probably feeling excited and maybe a little sad that summer is over. Some kids feel nervous or a little scared on the first day of school because of all the new things: new teachers, new friends, and even a new school. Luckily, these \"new\" worries only stick around  for a little while. Let's find out more about going to a new school. Most teachers kick the new school year by introducing themselves and talking about all the stuff you'll be doing that year. Some teachers give students a chance to tell something about themselves to the rest of the class, too. When teachers do the talking on the first day, they often go over classroom rules and school rules so you'll know what's allowed and what's not. Please pay close attention. You might already know a lot of people in your classes on the first day, but it's a great day to make a new friend, so try to say hello to kids you know and new ones that you don't. Make the first move and you'll be glad you did, and so will your new friend! Seeing friends you haven't seen in a while can make the first day a good one. You can make the day feel special by wearing clothes that you really like. Maybe you got a great T-shirt on one of your vacations, or a pair of sneakers . It also can make you feel good to be prepared and have all the things you need, such as pencils, folders, and whatever else you'll be needing. But make sure that you pack them the night before in case  you don't have time in the morning.

{"answer": 0, "choices": ["gives us courage", "thinks highly of others", "shares great fame", "stands on the mountaintop"], "question": "Like many people, I have no clear idea about heroes. At some point, we all wonder if we need a hero and what a hero really is. Although there are a lot of differences in cultures, heroes around the world generally share a number of characteristics   which give us courage and make us want to learn from them. A hero does something worth talking about. A hero has a special story to tell and people think highly of it. But a hero is not just the person with great fame   . A hero has powers   larger than himself. Some people want to live like a hero, and they have to experience life with new and further meaning. A sure test for would-be heroes is what or whom they serve. What do they want to live and die for? If the answer suggests they serve only their own fame, they may be famous persons but not heroes. A hero has a _ from the mountaintop. He has the power to move people. He creates new possibilities. Without Gandhi, India might still be part of Britain.

As time went on, other Chinese people came to this area and Limhouse began to be known as \"Chinatown\". However London's Chinese community remained very small for many years: at the start of the 20thcentury, there were just 545 Chinese people in Britain. After the Second World War, many farmers in Hong Kong lost their jobs and came to London. As Limhouse had been almost destroyed during the war, they settled  in different area--a part of central London near Leicester Square. This area is now what Londoners call Chinatown. At first, the new immigrants   found it difficult to get jobs. In the 1950s, however, a small Chinese restaurant opened in London. Many British people visited it and said that Chinese food was wonderful! Suddenly, Chinese restaurants and take-aways started opening in every part of the city. Instead of too little work, the new Chinese immigrants now found that they had too much! They worked as cooks, managers or waiters. Most of them enjoyed their lives and arranged their friends and relatives to join them from overseas. As time went by, London's Chinese community became more and more successful.

{"answer": 2, "choices": ["In the east of London", "In Limhousse", "Not far from Leicester Square.", "Outside the city"], "question": "London's Chinese community  dates back to the 18thcentury, when a small number of Chinese sailors moved to the city to work in Limhouse, east London. As time went on, other Chinese people came to this area and Limhouse began to be known as \"Chinatown\". However London's Chinese community remained very small for many years: at the start of the 20thcentury, there were just 545 Chinese people in Britain. After the Second World War, many farmers in Hong Kong lost their jobs and came to London. As Limhouse had been almost destroyed during the war, they settled  in different area--a part of central London near Leicester Square. This area is now what Londoners call Chinatown. At first, the new immigrants   found it difficult to get jobs. In the 1950s, however, a small Chinese restaurant opened in London. Many British people visited it and said that Chinese food was wonderful! Suddenly, Chinese restaurants and take-aways started opening in every part of the city. Instead of too little work, the new Chinese immigrants now found that they had too much! They worked as cooks, managers or waiters. Most of them enjoyed their lives and arranged their friends and relatives to join them from overseas. As time went by, London's Chinese community became more and more successful. The sons and daughters of the original restaurant workers studied and worked very hard. And most went on to get highly paid jobs.

It was one of the greatest achievements in Agassi's long and successful career. Andre Agassi turned professional in 1986 at the age of sixteen. His career soon took off, and in 1990, Agassi was famous around the world, though never having won an important tennis championship. Many people thought he was famous more for his long blond hair and colorful tennis shirts than for his tennis skills. They wondered if he could really win an important tournament. In 1992, Agassi proved _ wrong by winning one of the greatest prizes in world tennis--the Wimbledon singles final. His first attempt to win this tournament had been in 1987, but he lost his opening game. He then refused to take part in Wimbledon for the next three years. He said his reason for not playing was that the officials refused to allow him to wear his colorful shirts, but some people said it was because he was afraid to lose. After several more championship victories, Agassi's luck began to run out. By 1997, the year of his marriage to a movie actress--- Brooke Shields, Agassi's ranking had dropped to 141stin the world.

In a small town in the United States, a large group of girls cleaned the banks of 11 kilometers of their river. Young people may hear about conversation through a song called \"No one's going to change our world\". It was made by Cliff Gichard and other singers. The money from it will help to conserve tigers, elephants and pandas on the earth. What must we do now according to the passage?", "subject": ""}

Many young people, when they finish school at the age of 18, take a gap year before they go to university. Parents often want their children to grow up a little and see what the real world is like when they finish school. Although they are worried about their safety, many think that the advantages of independence and experience are worth the worries. Children are encouraged to be brave, independent and to explore the world on their own or with friends. Young people also want to experience freedom and see what life is like on the other side. This other side could be the other side of the world or just the other side of life. For example, if they have a rich life, they may want to see how people in poor areas live. A gap year after school is also an important chance for young people to spend time thinking about what they want to do with their lives. A little bit of growing up and experience will help them make their important career decisions, especially when they are unsure about what they want to study. Another reason for going straight after school is to get a break from studying before they start the next few years of university. So anywhere you travel in the world, you will meet young European people exploring the world. So much of the world has been travelled and explored. The young people are now looking for more worthy experiences. Some of them work as volunteers to do something for the country they are visiting.
