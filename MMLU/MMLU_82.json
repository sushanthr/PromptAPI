What about die-hard fans whose team always loses? The team spirit keeps those fans from losing hope. Knowing that other fans are probably feeling the same way also helps them. In addition, there is always the hope that their team will win the next game. Russell has lost some friends because of his love for baseball and although you may think that would make him unhappy, he has made many more new friends because of his team spirit. For Sam Russell, supporting the Red Sox is not just a hobby; it is a way of life and the secret of his happiness. The best title for the reading is  _  .", "subject": ""}

{"answer": 0, "choices": ["Understanding.", "Honesty.", "Reliability.", "A sense of humor."], "question": "In choosing a friend, one should be very careful. A good friend can help you study. You can have fun together and make each other happy. Sometimes you will meet fair-weather friends. They will be with you as long as you have money or luck, but when you are down, they will run away. How do I know when I have found a good friend? I look for certain qualities  of character, especially understanding, honesty and reliability . Above all else, I look for understanding in a friend. A good friend tries to understand how another person is feeling. He is not quick to judge. Instead, he tries to learn from others. He puts himself in the other person's place, and he tries to think of ways to be helpful. He is also a good listener. At the same time, however, a good friend is honest. He does not look for faults  in others. He notices their good points. In short, a friend will try to understand me and accept me. Another quality of a friend is reliability. I can always depend on a good friend. If he tells me he will meet me somewhere at a certain time, I can be sure that he will be there. If I need a favor, he will do his best to help me. If I am in trouble, he will not run away from me. There is a fourth quality that makes a friend special. A special friend is someone with whom we can have fun. We should enjoy our lives, and we would enjoy our friendship. That is why I especially like friends who are fun to be with. A good friend likes the same things I like.

{"answer": 2, "choices": ["Weather Report", "Story About a Weatherman", "About Weather", "How to Begin a Talk"], "question": "An American writer, Mr Green once  said, \"Everybody talks about the weather, but nobody does anything about it.\" It is true that everybody talks about the weather. Many people begin their talks by saying, \"Isn't it a nice day?\" \"Do you think it will rain?\" \"I think it's going to snow.\" Many people think they can tell what the weather is going to be like. But sometimes they don't agree with each other. One man may say, \"Do you see how cloudy it is in the east? It's going to rain tomorrow.\" Another man will say, \"No, it's going to be fine tomorrow.\" People often look for the weather they want. When a farmer needs water, he looks for something to tell him it's going to rain, and he doesn't look for anything else. When friends have a picnic, they hope the weather is going to be fine and they can sit eating their lunch under the blue sky. Almost everyone listens to what the weatherman says.

{"answer": 3, "choices": ["Weather.", "Actions of others.", "Personality.", "Age."], "question": "For hundreds Of years, scientists have been trying to answer what things have an effect on people's emotions  . How you feel is controlled by many things. Your emotions can be affected by your personality, by the actions of others and by events around you. Perhaps you don't know your emotions can be influenced by the weather as well. People often say they feel good when the sun is shining and sad when it is cloudy. In fact, sunlight makes us feel good. When sunlight hits our skins, our bodies produce a vitamin. Vitamins are natural chemicals   which we all need to stay healthy. Sunlight helps our bodies produce vitamin D. Vitamin D helps our bodies make a special chemical. This special chemical affects our brains   and makes us feel happy. For example, there are long, dark winters of little sunlight in Sweden and Norway, so many people in these countries often feel sad. Without much sunlight, their bodies produce less vitamin D. Without enough vitamin D, their bodies make less of this special chemical which makes them feel good. To help the people in these countries feel better, special \"sunrooms\" with artificial   lights have been built. People can go there and get \"sunlight\" for an hour or two! The weather can also affect people's emotions in other ways. Hot weather can make people angry because people feel uncomfortable when they are hot. In the same way, rain can make people angry because being wet can be unpleasant. As you can see, the weather can have an effect on the chemicals which control our brains.

Plastic boxes are better than cardboard or wooden ones because they can' be chewed . If going by plane or train during warm weather,try to go in the cooler early morning or evening hours. Also try to avoid  very cold winter weather because pets often suffer from cold. Even in your own car, be careful. Do not leave the animal inside with the windows closed because the car may become too hot or too cold. Which person would be the most interested in this passage?", "subject": ""}

Surely you need to find a way to get in touch with the outside world. Your best chance of doing this is to draw the attention of a passing plane. Body signals  Pilots from different countries understand body signals if they have the correct training. When you wave your arms up and down in a straight line, it means \"yes\". When you point downwards and swing your arm from side to side, it means \"no\". If you want the pilot to know that it's safe to land, push your hands out in front of you and bend your knees. If you want to say that it's not safe to land, put your arms in the air and move them to one side. Smoke signals The smoke from a fire can be seen from far away, so it's a good way to draw attention. If the weather is dry, it isn't hard to start a fire. Remember, however, that fires can be very dangerous if they get out of control. Never light a fire unless you're sure that it can't spread. If the ground is dark, light smoke can be seen more easily. Green grass and leaves produce light smoke. Ground-to-air signals It's a good idea to build some signals, too. Use large pieces of wood to make the symbols . If you can't find any wood, use earth. Some useful symbols are: F \"I need food and water.\" II \"I need medicine.\" I \"I am badly hurt.\" X\" I am unable to move from here.\" Pilots' replies If the pilot lowers the plane's wings from side to side, this means \"message received and understood\".

You may feel miserable, but actually your wonderful body is doing everything it can to kill the cold. Different people have different remedies for colds. In the United States and sane other countries, for example, people might eat chicken soup to feel better. Some people take hot baths and drink warm liquids.  Other people take medicine to stop the fever, congestion, and running nose. There is one interesting thing to note - some scientists say taking medicines when you have a cold is actually bad for you. The virus stays in you longer because your body doesn't have a way to fight it and kill it .Bodies can do an amazing job on their own.

However, his dream remained. At the age of 33, Ted was a truck driver in Los Angeles. One day, while sitting outside in his garden, he watched planes fly overhead and an idea came to him: to use balloons  to fly. A few weeks later, Ted bought 42 huge balloons. He tied them to a chair and then he sat down in the chair with some beer, sandwiches and a gun. His plan was to fly to 10 meters above his garden, enjoy a few hours in the air, and then shoot some balloons with his gun to get back down. But things did not go as he planned. Once his friends cut the ropes under Ted's chair, the 42 balloons flew into the sky at an astonishing speed until about 4000 meters above the ground with Ted and his chair. He didn't shoot any of the balloons because he was afraid he might break the balanee  of his \"plane\". Ted stayed in the sky with his beer and sandwiches for 14 hours, cold and frightened. Planes heading towards Los Angeles' busy international airport reported the strange sight. And Ted' s balloons caused great danger to them.
