It means visitors to the 17thcentury Woolsthorpe Manor, near Grantham, Lincolnshire, will no longer be able to sit under its branches as Newton was said to have been doing in 1665 when \"the notion of gravitation came to mind.\" The National Trust, which owns the small manor where Newton was born in 1642, said the 2ft-high barrier was designed to _ the tree.

For a long time, many scientists thought that only people could act generously just because it feels good. However, a new study in Germany suggests that chimpanzees  also do good things for no real reason. And so do children who are as young as 18 months of age. Maybe it is because humans and chimpanzees share an ancestor  about 6 million years ago. People and chimpanzees appear to develop such features  without any other training, says Warneken, a scientist in Germany. Warneken and his partners worked on adult chimpanzees that live on an island in the African country of Uganda. They also worked with 18-month-old children in Germany. The researchers performed three experiments on the adult chimpanzees and two experiments on the kids. In the first animal experiment,a person tried to reach his arm into a cage to get a stick,but he couldn't reach it. A chimpanzee was in the cage,and it could reach the stick if it wanted to. Thirty-six chimpanzees took part in this experiment one by one, and no chimpanzee saw what the other chimpanzees had done. Even though the animals hadn't met the person before, they usually took the stick and gave it to the person. What's more, they did this whether or not the person offered them bananas as a reward. In a similar experiment, 36 children acted in a similar way. They helped the person reach the stick, whether or not they were offered toys for their help. Researchers did other experiments on chimpanzees and babies. No rewards were offered in either experiment. And still, both the chimpanzees and children went out of their way to help.

It challenges the belief  that short-sightedness is caused by computer use, watching TV or reading in weak light. The Australian government researchers believe that the sunlight is good for people's eyes. They compared the vision  and habits of 100 seven-year-old children in Singapore and Australia. In all, 30% of the Singaporean children were short-sighted--this rate  was ten times higher than Australian children. Both groups spend a similar amount  of time reading, watching television and playing computer games. However the Singaporean children spent an average   of only half an hour a day outdoors--90 minutes less than the Australian children. Professor Ian Morgan, from the Australian Research Council's vision Centre, said, \"Humans are naturally long-sighted, but when people begin to go to school and spend little or no time outdoors, the number of short-sighted people gets larger. We're also seeing more and more short-sighted children in cities all around the world and the main reason may be that city children spend less time outdoors. Daylight can be hundreds of times brighter than indoor light. But why does playing outside  prevent us from becoming short-sighted? Scientists believe that natural light has a special chemical  which stops the eyeball from growing out of shape and prevents people from becoming short-sighted. So be outdoors.

Crows are dirty birds because they live on bad food. Crows eat a lot of waste food. In this way they are more useful to us than any birds. They clean up the dirty things in our streets. Crows are always hungry. They look for food all day, and in the evening you can see them in large numbers flying back to their nests  in the trees. They sleep there at night. Crows are much noisier than other birds. Very often a large number of crows will get together on one house and talk. Sometimes they talk together, and sometimes they do it by turns  like human beings . It is easy to tell  from crow's sound if they are pleased or angry. Perhaps crows talk a lot because they are friendly birds.

How can they carry traits, such as being tastier, brighter, and riper? They are genetically engineered. Genetic engineering is like making a change in a recipe. For example, when you make cakes, you mix together all of the usual ingredients. If you add an extra ingredient, like salt, the cakes will taste differently. Genes are ingredients in the recipe for life. They carry the traits of living things. Your genes dictate what color hair and eyes you'll have, how tall you'll be, as well as many other traits. Genes carry traits for plants, too. By adding genes to a plant, you can sometimes create new traits. For example, adding a certain gene to a potato plant can make the potato plant distasteful to bugs . This makes some farmers happy because they don't have to use chemicals to keep bugs away from their plants. It sounds great, but some people are opposed to the idea of food that is genetically engineered. Ronnie Cummins, from the Campaign for Food Safety, is against it. He says that one of the major concerns is allergies . Supermarkets don't always label foods that are genetically engineered. A customer could unknowingly buy food that has an added gene from another plant that he or she is allergic to. It could be dangerous. Gary Burton from Monsanto, a seed company that engineers food, disagrees. He says his company tests for allergies. Burton believes that genetic engineering is a valuable tool for making better food. The technology can help farmers use less insecticide and grow healthier crops. Burton thinks there are many advantages. But Cummins says that we just don't know what will happen in the future if we keep adding genes to foods. We could mistakenly create a monster.

So I understood what this father was experiencing. \"Yes, I did.\" I answered, \"But why is this a last goodbye?\" \"I am old and my daughter lives much too far away. Maybe her next trip back will be for my funeral  ,\" he said. \"When you were saying goodbye, I heard you say 'I wish you enough'. What does that mean?\" He began to smile. \"My parents used to say it to me. When we say 'I wish you enough', we want the other person to have a life filled with enough good things.\" He stopped for a moment and continued, \"I wish you enough sun to keep your attitude bright. I wish you enough rain to appreciate (, ) the sun more. I wish you enough happiness to keep your spirit alive. I wish you enough pain so that the smallest joys in life seem much bigger... I wish you enough 'Hellos' to get you through the final 'Goodbye'\". He then said goodbye to me and walked away. According to the passage, why must we be wished enough pain?", "subject": ""}

Moments later, he saw a dog, but not its lead. He tripped over the lead and fell down. He jumped up quickly, went on running and got on the bus. After a while an old coach broke down in the middle of the road, and the driver couldn't move it. It was eight o'clock, the middle of the rush hour, so it soon created a terrible traffic jam. The bus driver tried to go round the coach. Unfortunately a taxi was coming in the opposite direction. The driver tried to stop the taxi, but he couldn't prevent the accident-- the taxi crashed into the front of the bus! Luckily nobody was hurt. When Daniel finally got to school out of breath, the Science lesson had been on for five minutes. Daniel said sorry to the teacher and sat at his desk. He reached out for his school bag-- no, it was nowhere to be found. \"Where is my school bag?\" Daniel was puzzled. Suddenly he realized that he had left it on the bus. Bad luck!

You can use it to fly a kite or to sail a boat. Wind is one of our cleanest and richest power sources, as well as one of the oldest. Something shows that windmills  began to be used in ancient Iran back in the seventh century BC. They were first introduced to Europe during the 1100s, when armies returned from the Middle East with knowledge of using wind power. For many centuries, people used windmills to make wheat into flour  or get water from deep underground. When electricity was discovered in the late 1800s, people living in faraway areas began to use them to produce electricity. This allowed them to have electric lights and radio. However, by the 1940s when electricity was available to people in almost all areas of the United States, windmills were hardly used. During the 1970s, people started becoming more cared about the pollution that is created when coal and gas are burned to produce electricity. People also realized that the supply of coal and gas would run out one day. Then, wind was rediscovered, though it means higher costs.

Many cultures believed that comets were messages sent by gods, and people thought these messages were warning signs for bad behavior. But today science and technology give us a better understanding of comets. Last week, comet Ison ended its million-year-long journey as it flew straight toward the sun, melting most of the comet. It was hoped that comet Ison would survive this trip around the sun. Because once it got near Earth, it would have produced a great show of lights for us. In ancient times, the coming of comet Ison might have scared people. However, now we can track a comet's journey in our solar system. We can also study what they're made of. There is even a project to launch a spacecraft onto a comet to study them further. Although from the sky they look like great giant fireballs, comets are a collection of gas, ice, dust and small rocks. As a comet goes into our solar system, the sun's solar winds blow some of the dust and gas away, giving the comet a tail. The average size of comets is about 10 kilometers in diameter . But amazingly, their tails can be 150 kilometers long! Comet Ison's diameter was about 5 kilometers. Today, people don't fear comets as much as they did before.

Yet many people continue to use them while driving even though it' s dangerous. Research has shown that it is difficult to concentrate on  driving and talking at the same time. It can even be more dangerous than driving after drinking too much. A recent study found that when drivers were talking on their mobile phones, their stopping times were 30 percent slower than when they had drunk too much - and nearly 50 percent slower than when they were driving normally. It also found that drivers talking on mobile phones were less able to control their cars than drunk drivers. And talking isn't even the most serious problem, but texting is. Unbelievably, another recent study reported that 22% of adults admitted  they had sent a text message while driving at least once in the past month.

Hotel guests have their meals free, so their good faith is to wave their registration card to the waiter. With such a loose check, you can easily use any old registration card to take a couple of friends and dine free of charge. With so many loopholes   in everyday life, surely Finland must be a heaven to those who love to take \"pretty advantages\". But the strange things is, all the taxi-passengers would always come back to pay their fare after they have attended to their business; not a single outsider has ever been found in the free hotel dining rooms.

Watching nature, watching people and watching animals communicate with each other provide some of the simplest ways to life's biggest problems. This became clearer to me yesterday. It caused me to ask myself, \"How do I respond   to the storms in life?\" People usually run when it starts to rain. I love to walk in it, stand on my front door and feel it. I grew up doing it and have never really felt the fear many people do. The animal world senses changes in the weather far earlier than humans. My dog, Ricky, begins to shake long before the storm is close enough to be noticed. I was about to feed my three dogs yesterday and as usual, I let them out in the yard first.

An adult dodo could grow to a height of about a meter and weigh between 45-50 pounds. The natural habitat of this kind of bird lay in the forest of Mauritius. Seed  and fruits that were found in the forest were the main food of the dodo birds. As they could easily get the food they required in the forest, they didn't need to fly. As time went by, they finally lost the ability to fly. It turned out to be a major disadvantage for dodos, as they were left with no ability to protect themselves against human beings' attacks in their natural habitat, which drove this kind of bird to extinction . The extinction of the dodo started in 1505, when Portuguese sailors set their foot on the Island of Mauritius. Before this, the dodo didn't face any danger. People began to hunt them. It was not long before animals, like cats, pigs and monkeys, were also introduced to the island by humans. When ships arrived, the rats on these ships came onto the land. Though these animals were not able to attack huge dodos, it was easy for them to attack dodos' nests on the ground. These animals continued to feed on dodo eggs.

Jim was so surprised that he stopped to look at him closely. It was an icy morning and he looked very old. The poor old man didn't have anything to cover himself with. Jim went into his house to get the old man a blanket . However, there were no extra blankets, so Jim thought hard and took his father's coat. It was the only thing of his father's that he had left. Jim wrote a short note. \"Sir, I found you sleeping in front of my house. This is my father's coat. I hope it fits you well.\" He put the note in a pocket of the coat, and covered the old man with the coat. Then he went to work. When he came back three hours later, both the man and the coat were gone. Jim thought that it was the best thing he could have done with his father's coat. That afternoon, Jim hurried home after school because Joy was at home alone. However, Joy and the old man were standing in front of the house, and Joy shouted to Jim, \"Brother!He's our grandfather!\" The grandfather smiled and said, \"Jim, I have been looking for you all around the country for eight years. I'm not rich. But I can take care of you two. Thank you for giving me the coat and letting me know what a good person my grandson is. This coat was the very one that I gave my own son, a long time ago.\" The best title of the passage is \"  _  \".", "subject": ""}

Scientists have been studying why those bees have been leaving their hives and not returning. They believe that their living environment may be changing. Now, the US government is stepping in to help fight this problem. President Barack Obama has asked for $50 million(310 million yuan ) in his 2015 budget to fight this problem, and has announced the start of the Pollinator Health Task Force. This group will work on keeping the US bee population healthy and strong, and will show people what they can do to help bees. Even though many people may not like bees, they are an important part of how we grow food. As pollinators , they move from one plant to another. Through pollination, plants can grow seeds and fruit. It's said that at least 90 kinds of plants including nuts,  fruits and vegetables depend on bees for pollination. The new Pollinator Health Task Force will work hard to protect bees, and build new hives for pollinators. It also plans to start a public education activity to make more people know the importance of pollinators, and actions that can be taken to protect them. The group will reach out to schools, libraries, museums and so on.

Each teenager will be expected to spend between four hours and two days a week on work placements with business related to the school and a personal coach will be sent to the teenagers to act as a school \"line manager\". The reforms   are put forward because of the fears that too many teenagers are finishing full-time education at present but they are short of the skills needed to succeed in the workplace.

A comet sometimes looks like a star. Like a planet, a comet has no light of its own. It shines from the sunlight it reflects  . Like the earth a comet goes around the sun, but on a much longer path than the earth travels. If a comet isn't a star, what is it then?

You should enjoy life's simple pleasures, such as reading a good book, listening to your favorite music, or spending time with close friends. People who have several close friends often live happier and healthier lives. Another secret to living a happy life is to be active. Many people go dancing or play sports. People can forget about their problems and only think about the activities. Finally, many people find happiness in helping others.

So, how do household objects that are part of Internet of things work? Well, think of a usual chair. When connected to the Internet, the chair warms up when it knows that the user has just walked into the room and is feeling cold. An Internet-connected camera, like a smart-home camera, could help people feel safer in their homes. It can recognize people's faces, and even can see when someone passes by in the dark. Then it can send you a message on your smartphone to let you know who's there. If the person is someone you don't know, it can tell you that, too. But according to MIT Technology Review, whether companies are connecting dog food bowls or security systems to the Internet, there may be problems. For example,many early connected-home devices don't have much built-in security, which means they could be hacked ,In addition, it could be difficult to get these devices to work together because they are made by different companies.
