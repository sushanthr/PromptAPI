Maybe there is a person who you don't want to be friends with or even talk to. Well, this saying means that you dislike him or her so much that you don't want to touch or go near him or her, even within ten feet! You don't have a leg to stand on. This saying doesn't mean that the person you're talking to has no legs. It means that his or her argument is incorrect. He or she doesn't have a leg to stand on because he or she has no facts to support what he or she is saying. This saying is a good way to tell people that you think they're wrong. Break a leg! This saying actually means the opposite of what it sounds like. If you tell this to a person, you're wishing him or her good luck!The saying comes from a superstition  that whatever you say aloud, the opposite will come true.

And it's a great way to keep fit. If you carry a tent and some food, you can camp overnight. But wild places can be dangerous. Here's how you can enjoy walking and camping safely.

What to do if you get lost  If you're in a car and it has broken down, stay with your car.  If you are not traveling by car, make yourself easy to see. A signal fire can be seen at night.

{"answer": 0, "choices": ["songs that keep going round in our mind", "worms that live in a part of our brain", "tunes by pop singers like Lady Gaga", "parasites clearly under our control"], "question": "\"Earworms\", some people call them. Songs that get stuck in your head go round and round, sometimes for days, sometimes for months. For no clear reason you cannot help yourself from humming or singing a tune by Lady Gaga. To a psychologist, the most interesting thing about earworms is that they show a part of our mind that is clearly outside of our control. Earworms arrive without permission and refuse to leave when we tell them to. They are parasites   living in a part of our minds. If you have got an earworm you can suffer an attack of it simply by someone mentioning the tune, without having to hear it. This proves that earworms are a part of long-term memory. Humans have an \"inner ear\", for remembering phone numbers, for instance. When it gets infected with earworms, rather than review our plans for the day, or lists of things to remember, the inner ear gets stuck on a few short bars of music or a couple of phrases from a song. A part of us that we normally do not have to think about, that should just do what we ask, has been turned against us, upsetting us with a request that we never asked for. The mind is an inner world which we do not have complete knowledge of, or have control over. Fortunately psychology can provide some advice on how to deal with an uncontrollable mind. Consider the famous \"don't think of a white bear\" problem, which tells you to try not to think about white bears, or to do something else, to avoid both thinking of the white bear and not thinking of the white bear. For earworms, the solution may be the same. Our inner ear has become infected with an earworm. This is a part not under our control, so just sending in instructions to \"shut up\" is unlikely to be of much help (and has been shown to make it worse). Much better is to employ the inner ear in another task. If your mind is poisoned by Brittany Spears' Toxic, for instance, then try singing Kylie Minogue's Can't Get You out Of My Head.

But Mom and Dad are two of the most important people in your life. Over your lifetime, they may influence  you more than anyone else you will meet. Moms and Dads need to care for their kids every day. Most parents will do _ as long as they live. There are many ways to stay close, to get along well and to build a strong relationship  with your parents. Here are some of them: Spend time together. Don't play computer games or watch TV alone. Ask your mom and dad to play with you. Go outside together, or do some reading. Be kind. Little things might mean a lot to your mom or dad. You can give your parents a happy day with a card or a joke. It's also lovely when a kid cleans up his or her room without being asked.

{"answer": 2, "choices": ["Excited.", "Bored.", "Worried.", "Surprised."], "question": "Very few people enjoy exams. I don't, either. And although I tell myself not to worry about them, I always do! So I'm not surprised that my students worry about them, too, even though they usually don't need to. Because they are afraid of failing. However, since it is hard not to worry at all, we all must try not to worry too much. Why? Because worrying makes exams worse! How to do this? Ask the teacher about how to revise and about exam skills--how to work when you are in the exam. Good students don't wait until the week before an exam. They study all through the year. It is not possible to learn everything at the last minute. So don't leave it till then. If you start planning and working for each exam early and you make sure that you understand what you're studying, then, when it is over, you'll be able to say, \"What a good exam that was!\" Take a short rest during your time of work and revision.

It also has special underpasses   for animals like Tibetan antelopes   to go through. \"The new railroad greatly helps Tibet's tourism,\"said Liu Yueqin, an expert at the Chinese Academy of Social Sciences  .

Now one can buy a TV set for about 1,500 yuan. It used to be much higher than that price. When there was no railroad, it had been difficult to send things in and out of Tibet.

As time goes by, it becomes less and less, so what are we going to do when it runs out? Perhaps we will go back to using horses, carriages and bicycles.

The car didn't go fast, but they ran, so this was better than nothing. However, in the future, we can't cut down all our trees to make gas; we need our trees for other things, too. Besides different types of gas, we can also use electricity  to run our cars, but first we must make the electricity! Some countries have coal  and they make electricity with that, but we might not always have coal, either. Other countries have big, strong rivers, and they can use the power of water to turn turbines  and make electricity more easily and cheaply. We are also able to get power from the ocean tides.

That's regrettable  , because saying hello is more than just saying hello-it is the respect of another's worth. How might the world change-how might we change-if we used this word well? To find out, l spent one month saying hello to every person I met. Here's what I've learned. It can improve productivity. In one of the few studies ever done on this subject, Allan Allday, an assistant professor of special education at Oklahoma State University, had middle school teachers greet their students individually   each morning. This exchange of greetings raised the kids' productivity. School went from impersonal to personal   , and that led to more class participation  and better grades. Environments influence friendliness, One study found that people in the city were less likely to shake hands with a stranger than those in the countryside. And researchers say, pleasure environments generally encourage more smiles and hellos than unpleasant ones. My experience was similar. Whatever the reason, my hellos were answered far less often than the ones in the countryside. Similarly, people in vacation areas, like the Jersey Shore, were far friendlier than those hurrying to work in the centre of the city. It's a form of health insurance . It's impossible to say hello without smiling. And smiling has been shown to lower blood pressure  , make people feel happier and improve happiness. It seems that saying hello creates a similar influence. So maybe we can make the world a better place by saying hello. After a month of doing it.

It is thought that we won't have to go shopping because we will be able to get most things which are sold in shops on the Internet.

{"answer": 1, "choices": ["wo", "Three", "Four", "Five"], "question": "Most people hope to have a memory which helps them succeed in study, work and life. Can memory be improved? Luckily, hundreds of studies in the past 50 years have already given us a definite* answer. A healthy lifestyle keeps your brain young and memory sharp. First of all, it is necessary to have a healthy diet. Eating more food rich in B vitamins and Vitamin E, such as vegetables and lean meat, helps you have a better memory. Doing exercise can keep your brain alive, too. Proper exercise provides much needed oxygen for the brain. Running ,riding a bike ,swimming and even walking two or three times a week are helpful. Moreover, getting enough sleep is important. Only when your brain gets a good rest, can it work well. The healthier your lifestyle is, the better your memory will become, but do not expect a sudden change---it takes a long time to make a difference. Memory skills help you remember things better. The following three are the most widely used. Chunking* is a way of remembering a piece of information by cutting it into smaller ones. For example, to memorize a ten--digit telephone number 2127983630,you can divide the digits into three groups: first 212,then 798,and lastly 3630.This method is far more effective than remembering a string* of 10 digits. Organization means organizing information into groups of the the same kind. For example, trees, grass and flowers are plants; tigers, panadas, horses and cows are animals ,Imagery is remembering newly learnt information by using your imagination and connecting it with something that you are familiar with. However, memory skills will hardly work if you don't understand the information. What's more, only a regular review can make the memory last long. That is why students are always advised to go over what they have learnt after one day and then after three days, and then use it as regularly as possible.

When you have a question, especially something about a science or math, don't always turn to your teacher! It is a good idea to try to find the answer yourself.

Language learning can be easy if you don't want or need to learn too much. The key to successful language learning in my mind is not to set the goal too high. It is rather like running. Even if you run twice a week, you don't necessarily want to be able to run a marathon  . You might just want to keep a level of fitness. I think the same can be true for language learning. Let's get back to the goal. If you decide to learn ten words in a foreign language before visiting the country, you know that you will be sure to do this. However, if you decide to talk to people with great fluency  , unless you are quite a talented person, you will probably fail and give up in half-way. It is also far easier to start learning a foreign language than to finish. In other words, the better you are, the slower it can be to improve, because you will not be able to move further because of grammar, making sentences, learning less common words, etc. If you are only trying to learn a few foreign words and sentences, you will enjoy faster progress, have more fun, and won't have to spend too much time. The idea of learning only a few hundred words in a language, and then stopping, isn't the usual way to language learning, but it can be a very meaningful and enjoyable activity.

Maybe they send you out of the classroom because you fail to finish doing your homework. If this happens in Shanghai, you can stand up and say \"No\". Shanghai students may have less homework because of the law. Class hours may become shorter for juniors next year, down from 45 minutes to 40 minutes in some schools. The law also talks about students' health. According to the rules,\"Smoking in these places full of kids is not allowed.\"That means you can ask your teacher to stop if he smokes in a classroom. The law makes schools safer for students. \"No dancing halls, Internet bars or computer game bars are allowed within(......)200 meters of a school gate.\" the law says. The law is great, right? Many students like it. \"My mom reads my diaries sometimes. I think she will be afraid if I tell her she is doing something against the law.\" said Luo Jia, 13, at Shanghai Fuxing Junior School.

{"answer": 1, "choices": ["three", "four", "five", "six"], "question": "Lin Xiao, 21, a student at Guangdong University, has a big family - her two parents, a younger brother and two younger sisters. Lin took her role as the \"big sister\" seriously. When her first sister was born, Lin took turns with her mom holding the baby late into the night. \"I almost did everything that was supposed to be a parent's job, but I felt proud of myself,\" she said. Not all of Lin's classmates shared her experiences because of the family planning policy  , a law that was carried out in China about forty years ago. But the situation is about to change. A new policy made on October 29 said all couples can now have two children. The new policy is expected to help raise the population of China. Recently, China has been facing an aging population and labor shortages because of the low birth rate  . The two-child policy may also be the gift for every only child. Researchers found that growing up with a brother or sister can have good influence on one's mental health. \"Brothers and sisters do matter in unique ways. They give kids something that parents don't.\" Laura Walker, a professor from Beijing University, told China Daily. She noted that having a brother or a sister protects teenagers against loneliness, fear and so on. Liu Fang, 20, from Shenzhen University, has a 2-year-younger sister. When her sister disagreed with parents over choosing a college major, she helped her to communicate with parents. \"If necessary, I would always have her back,\" said Liu. \"The best part of having a sister is that you have a partner, friend and supporter throughout your life.\" But children with brothers or sisters also have to learn to understand and look after each other, said Laura.
