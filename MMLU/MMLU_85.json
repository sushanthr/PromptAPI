Lin took her role as the \"big sister\" seriously. When her first sister was born, Lin took turns with her mom holding the baby late into the night. \"I almost did everything that was supposed to be a parent's job, but I felt proud of myself,\" she said. Not all of Lin's classmates shared her experiences because of the family planning policy  , a law that was carried out in China about forty years ago. But the situation is about to change. A new policy made on October 29 said all couples can now have two children. The new policy is expected to help raise the population of China. Recently, China has been facing an aging population and labor shortages because of the low birth rate  . The two-child policy may also be the gift for every only child. Researchers found that growing up with a brother or sister can have good influence on one's mental health. \"Brothers and sisters do matter in unique ways. They give kids something that parents don't.\" Laura Walker, a professor from Beijing University, told China Daily. She noted that having a brother or a sister protects teenagers against loneliness, fear and so on. Liu Fang, 20, from Shenzhen University, has a 2-year-younger sister. When her sister disagreed with parents over choosing a college major, she helped her to communicate with parents. \"If necessary, I would always have her back,\" said Liu. \"The best part of having a sister is that you have a partner, friend and supporter throughout your life.\" But children with brothers or sisters also have to learn to understand and look after each other, said Laura.

When we have a conversation with someone, we may be using more body language than words. However, the same body language may mean different things in different countries. That's why people sometimes do not understand each other correctly. Pointing to one part of the body can mean differently in different cultures. For example, in the USA people point to their heads when they think someone is clever. However, in Europe  it means 'He or she is stupid or something is wrong with his or her head'. In our Chinese culture, nodding our head up and down means 'yes' and shaking our head from side to side means 'no'. However, in parts of India, Greece and Turkey, it means just the opposite . In England or the USA, when you raise your hand and make a circle with the thumb and the second finger, it means 'You're all right or Everything is OK'.

{"answer": 1, "choices": ["broken wheat", "lying wheat", "harvested wheat", "growing wheat"], "question": "In the summer of 1978 an English man named Steven was driving his tractor through a field of wheat when he discovered something strange. Some of his wheat was lying on the ground. The flattened wheat formed a circle about six meters across . Around this circle were four smaller circles of flattened wheat. Three years later a farmer who lived nearby discovered almost the same circles in one of his fields. These circles were larger--nearly 15 meters across . That same year , another English farmer discovered three circles of flattened wheat on his land--one large circle between two small circles. During the following years, farmers in England found circles in their fields more and more often. The circles are called \"crop circles\" because they usually appear in fields of wheat or corn. The wheat in the circles lies on the ground but is never broken; it keeps on growing, and the farmers can later harvest it. Farmers always discover the crop circles in the morning, so the circles probably form at night. They appear only in the months from May to September. What causes the crop circles? At first, people thought that some kids were making them as a joke, or that farmers were making them to attract tourists.(In fact, in 1991, two men said they made the circles themselves, but many scientists don't believe them.) People tried to copy them: They tried to make circles exactly like the ones the farmers had found. They couldn't do it. They couldn't enter a field of wheat without leaving tracks, and they couldn't flatten the wheat without breaking it. Several times people reported seeing stranger objects near the fields where crop circles later appeared. Many people believe that these crop circles are the messages sent by living things from outer space or the marks left by their spaceships. Scientists who have studied the crop circles try to find out what causes them. In the summer of 1990 some scientists spent three weeks in the part of England where many circles have appeared. They had all the latest high-tech equipment . The equipment--worth 1.8 million dollars--got nothing. But one night, as the scientists were watching a field, crop circles formed in the field behind them, which were quite different from the others. The scientists had neither seen nor heard anything. When Steven discovered the crop circles on his land in 1978, he said, \"It was just like something that had landed in the field from the air and gone back up again. I don't know what to make of these things.\" Crop circles have appeared in England, Japan, the United States and Russia.

In one day, 3,000 students made over 10,000 donations of water,books and clothes. Peng and other four students went to the Mashan School and gave the donations with five teachers. They visited poor families, made surveys and had classes at the school.

He travels to cold areas like Alaska and Canada to find snowstorms and take pictures of the snowflakes. \"They are often beautiful, and every snowfall brings new surprises,\" says Ken.

However this meant that we walked in the mornings, and then stopped at a cafe for lunch each day, before returning to the place we live. Edward and I slept in front of the fire all afternoon, while the ladies went for another walk. Very pleasant! I have taken lots of photos from the place we live, across the valley below us, of the morning sunrise, and the mist in the valley. Also, in England, the old steam powered trains are very popular. I have taken many photos of the train and from it. Yesterday we had the first snow of this winter. It is very early (we usually expect snow in January). It rained all day, then snowed in the evening.

{"answer": 3, "choices": ["an advertisement of a typhoon", "a travel record", "a weather report", "a science magazine"], "question": "Maybe you know floods, earthquakes, sandstorms and so on. But have you heard of typhoons? Typhoons are some of the worst storms, usually around the Pacific Ocean and the South China Sea. Most happen in July, August and September. How does a typhoon happen? When lots of sea water gets hot in the summer sun, it evaporates  into the air. This makes the air hotter. When the air gets warm enough, it starts to move higher up into sky. Then cooler air around it rushes in. It fills the space that is left. After the air gets warmer, it starts to move quickly, making wind. The wind goes in circles and it keeps moving higher in the sky. The warmer the air gets, the quicker the wind moves. And when the wind moves faster than 30 metres a second, a typhoon begins. A typhoon has two parts, one is called the \"eye\". In the eye, the wind does not move so fast. The other part is the wall of clouds around the eye. Here are the strongest winds and hardest rains. Typhoons are very dangerous. In November this year, Typhoon Haiyan killed 5500 people in Philippines. More people are missing. What to do when a typhoon hits? Stay inside.

{"answer": 3, "choices": ["We should be proud and selfish in the west.", "We should be modest and confident in the West.", "We should be modest and brave in the West.", "We should be brave and confident in the West."], "question": "One day, I heard an American boy said to a Chinese girl student, \"You speak very good English. \" But the girl answered, \" No, no. My English is very poor. \" The foreigner was quite surprised at the answer. Thinking he had not made himself understood or the girl had not heard him clearly, he said, \" Yes, indeed, you speak very well. \" But the girl still kept saying, \"No. \" In the end, the American boy could not understand and didn't know what to say. What's wrong with the girl's answer? She didn't accept a compliment  in the same way as the American people do. She should answer, \"Thank you\" instead of \"No\". She really understood what the American boy had said, but she thought she should be modest. In the west, people will feel proud and confident when they are praised. So if someone says the dishes you have cooked are very delicious, you should say, \"Thank you.\" In our country, we think being modest is a virtue and being proud is a bad thing, but in my opinion, being confident does not mean being proud, so sometimes you should be confident instead of being modest. If you are modest and say, \"No, I'm afraid I can't do it well\", while working in a western country, the others may think that you really cannot do it. If you often say, \"No\", you will certainly be _ by others. When asking for a job, if one says something like''Yes,I can certainly do it\"instead of \"let me have a try\",he or she will expect to get it. So in the west, you should be brave to show your self-confidence. What does the writer want to tell us?", "subject": ""}

One net held a very strange fish, five feet long and bright blue. Strangest of all, it had fins     that looked like legs! In the nets, only this fish stayed alive for several hours. Before the fish began to rot ( ), a young woman made a drawing of it. She sent her drawing to a scientist on sea life, Professor J. B. Smith. Upon seeing her drawing of the fish, Smith couldn't believe his eyes. Could it be true? It just didn't seem possible, but there it was. It could be only one thing, a coelacanth, a fish people believe having died out fifty million years ago. How could the fish be swimming about only a few days before? If we found one, there must be others. The professor put up posters offering a reward for catching such a fish. Other scientists laughed at Smith. They thought the search was a waste of time. Years passed. It seemed the other scientists were right. But Smith never gave up hope. One day, fourteen years later, the professor received a telegram. Afish had been caught that looked like the one in the poster. Would the scientist fly to the region and check the fish? Smith did. With shaking fingers the professor raised the cloth around the fish. It was exactly like the one in the young woman's drawing. It was a coelacanth,a missing link with the past! After the discovery of the coelacanth, scientists began to wonder.

Pen, pencil, eraser, ruler..., and don't forget a bottle of water! According to a study at the British Psychological ( ) Society Annual Conference held in London, students who bring water into exams may improve their grades by up to 10 percent. Scientists at the University of East London and the University of Westminster, UK, did a study on 447 students. The students were studying for different degrees   at the University of East London. Only 25 percent of them entered the exam hall with something to drink. Scientists then compared their exam results with their normal schoolwork grades. They found that all those who had brought drinks with them got better grades by between 2 and 10 percent. It is unclear why drinking water improves exam results. But scientists say having enough water in our bodies and not feeling thirsty could have a helpful effect on our brains. Drinking water may also cut down on anxiety ( ), which has a bad effect on exam performances, according to Chris Pawson, PhD, of the University of East London. \"Whatever the explanation, it is clear that students should try hard to stay hydrated  with water during exams,\" he said.

Now teleshopping is starting in Europe. In a number of European countries, people can turn on their TVs and shop for clothes, jewelry, food, toys and many other things. Teleshopping is becoming popular in Sweden, for example. The biggest Swedish company sells different kinds of things on TV in 15 European countries, and in one year it made$100 million. In France there are two teleshopping channels, and the French spend about$20 million a year to buy things through those channels. In Germany, until last year teleshopping was only possible on one channel for 1 hour every day. Then the government allowed more teleshopping. Other channels can open for telebusiness, including the largest American teleshopping company and a 24-hour teleshopping company. German businesses are hoping this new teleshopping will help them sell more things. Some people like teleshopping because it allows them to do their shopping without leaving their homes. With all the problems of traffic in the cities, this is an important reason. But at the same time, other Europeans do not like this new way of shopping. They call teleshopping \"junk on the air\".

As a _ of years of study, we know that too much animal fat is bad for our health. For example, Americans eat a lot of meat and only a small amount of grains, fruit and vegetables. Because of the way they eat, they have a high rate of cancer and heart disease. In Japan, people eat large amounts of grains and very little meat. The Japanese also have a very low rate of cancer and heart disease. The Japanese live longer than anyone else in the world. However, when Japanese people move to the US, the rate of heart disease and cancer goes up as their eating habit changes. And as hamburgers, ice creams and other high-fat foods become popular in Japan, the rate of heart disease and cancer is going up there as well. People are also eating more meat and dairy food in other countries, in which the disease rate is going up along with the change of the way people eat.
