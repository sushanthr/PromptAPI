We humans have lived on earth for only 35 000 years, but during this period we have changed our planet a lot in many ways. Some things we've done are very good for the earth while some are bad. All over the world, people have cut down millions of trees. When it rains or when the wind blows, the earth is taken away. Forests have become deserts, so more and more sorts of animals and plants are disappearing. In big cities, cars and buses have polluted the air. Many people in cities now have health problems. Factories have also polluted the land and the water. As a result, many rivers and lakes are now dead. Around the earth, there's a special kind of oxygen called \"ozone\"(O3). It is important to the earth. But now air pollution is destroying it and that has made a very big hole in the ozone layer. Too much harmful radiation from the sun passes through the hole and reaches the earth directly. This is very dangerous because this kind of radiation can cause cancer. Carbon dioxide (CO2) in the air has increased a lot. It mainly comes from burning oil, coal and wood. This has formed a \"blanket\" around the earth. The heat from the sun can't escape so the temperature is rising. This is called \"the greenhouse effect\". It causes the level of the oceans to rise and the climate of the earth to change. All these problems are very serious, so we must do something now. ,A, B, C, D. What is the best title for this passage?", "subject": ""}

Searching for things wastes their time,\" said Jing Chunling, an education expert. \"Besides, online shop owners have no idea of the ages of their buyers.

Now he is going to have his life and work commemorated  with special gold and silver coins. But does Twain need to be commemorated? It doesn't seem like people in the US will forget him. Twain once joked that a lack of money is the root of all evil \" but a lack of money with Twain's famous face on it wouldn't have made people forget about him. The Adventures of Huckberry Finn is thought to be his greatest works. Motherless Huck Finn is a young boy who shows the spirit of freedom. But it could be said that Huck's freedom really comes from Huck wanting to fly. When Huck gets away from his violent  father, he isn't really looking for freedom,out survival. It's even more of a problem for a slave. Jim, the escaped  slave who Huck helps, makes Huck's life seem even better. It's easier not to be able to deal with someone who wants to force you to go to school than to have to fight a law that says you are a piece of property . Huck and Jim's friendship, as shown by Mark Twain, is one of the great stories in American literature because it shows a white character, Huck, who gets an idea of the African American experience. Mark Twain is famous and would still be famous without any special coins.

For example, scientists have ever found that a dolphin can make a shy eel  come out of its hole with a dead fish. Dolphins use different sounds to exchange information with each other. Scientists in Hawaii have developed a sign language to give instructions to dolphins, and the results are amazing. They find that dolphins not only understand the meaning of individual   words, but also understand the importance of word order in a sentence. Most animals enjoy playing -- but dolphins seem to like making their games as challenging as possible. On a beautiful day in 1997, scientists at a beach watched a little dog going into the sea and swimming towards the dolphins. To their surprise, the dolphins came up to the dog and then started throwing it into the air. The dog seemed to enjoy the \"game\" and continued playing with the dolphins for more than an hour. Dolphins live in a very different world from ours, but they are very good at our \"IQ tests\" . For example, they will jump out of the water when they hear a whistle   noise. They do this because they will get a fish as a prize. There is still much to learn about these cute problem-solvers, but it is certain that watching a dolphin show is fun. ,.

To the people of India, the Ganges is great, but it is also important for transportation; ships can travel along it for a thousand miles. Other great rivers are the Congo in Africa and the Mekong in southeastern Asia. The greatest of all for navigation , however, is the Amazon in Brazil . It is so wide and so deep that large ships can go about two thousand miles up it. Besides transportation, rivers give food to eat, water to drink, water for crops, and chances for fun. In order to increase the supply  of water for crops, engineers sometimes build a dam  across a river and let a lake form behind the dam. Then people can use the water not only to irrigate  their fields but also to make electricity for their homes and industries. However, large cities and industries that are located on rivers often cause problems. As the cities grow in size and industries increase in number, the water in the rivers becomes polluted with chemicals and other materials.

To the people of India, the Ganges is great, but it is also important for transportation; ships can travel along it for a thousand miles. Other great rivers are the Congo in Africa and the Mekong in southeastern Asia. The greatest of all for navigation , however, is the Amazon in Brazil . It is so wide and so deep that large ships can go about two thousand miles up it. Besides transportation, rivers give food to eat, water to drink, water for crops, and chances for fun. In order to increase the supply  of water for crops, engineers sometimes build a dam  across a river and let a lake form behind the dam. Then people can use the water not only to irrigate  their fields but also to make electricity for their homes and industries. However, large cities and industries that are located on rivers often cause problems. As the cities grow in size and industries increase in number, the water in the rivers becomes polluted with chemicals and other materials. People are learning the importance, however, of doing more to keep their rivers clean if they want to enjoy the benefits of these natural resources.

{"answer": 3, "choices": ["55.", "175.", "325.", "275."], "question": "The human body is a living machine, and, like all machines, it needs \"fuel\" to supply it with energy. This is provided by the food we eat. But how much do we need to stay healthy? The energy value of food is usually measured in calories . A calorie is the amount of heat required to raise the temperature of 1 kg of water by 1degC. The number of calories people need per day is different, as the picture shows. Also, the number of calories you use at any one moment normally depends on the activity you are in. For example, you need more calories for standing than for sitting, more for running than for walking, and so on. The energy in food is in the form of three kinds of chemical materials--carbohydrate , protein  and fat. Carbohydrate provides 3.8 Cal /gm of the energy, protein 4.0 Cal/gm, and fat 8.8 Cal/gm. Each food contains different amounts of these materials, as the round pictures show.

{"answer": 3, "choices": ["avoid the job shortage", "face the cultural differences", "start his life in a new place", "study the law in college"], "question": "When I began to move to Auckland to study the law, my mother was a little worried about the uncertainty of living in a place that was so different from India, where we lived. She worried about the shortage of jobs and the cultural differences that I would face. I came to New Zealand in July 2013. I found the people were very nice and supportive. Soon after I arrived, I realized the importance of getting a part time job to make a living. Deciding to do this on my own, I spent a whole day going from door to door for a job. However, I received a little or no reply. This became my daily activity after college for a few weeks. One afternoon, I walked into a building to ask if there were any job chances. The people there were very surprised, and advised me not to continue my job search in that way. As I was about to leave, a secretary in the building came up to me and encouraged me to stay confident. He then offered to take me to the Royal Oak area to search for a job. Along the way, I realized I had run out of copies of my resume  .
