These inventions should be better known, even though I think that some of them are crazy. Let's have a look at some of these inventions and see if you agree that they should be more successful. The Australians had a great idea to stop people from drinking and driving. The idea was that if a driver wanted to start the car, she or he would have to blow into a bag first. If there was too much alcohol   in their breath, the car wouldn't start. It sounded like a great idea to me, but people said that they might need to drive the car in an emergency   even if they had drunk too much alcohol. Another idea I liked was an invention by a scientist who thought his children watched too much TV. He connected the TV to an exercise bike so that the electricity to power the TV was produced by the bike. If the children wanted to watch a lot of TV, they had to pedal   very hard. I found another invention on the Internet which encouraged good habits. Believe it or not, this invention was an ashtray   which spoke to you when you lit a cigarette! The \"voice\" of the ashtray was started by the heat from the cigarette and reminded you how dangerous it is to smoke. One of the strangest inventions I have come across is a bicycle which can cross rivers! The idea was that when you came to a river, you could _ a huge plastic ball all around the bike. You would then get into the ball which would float on the river while you pedaled the bike inside the ball! Why not use a bridge instead? A friend of mine at school once bought a strange pair of football shoes. On the bottom of the shoes there was a rotating pad of studs  . The idea was that you would change direction more quickly if the studs rotated with you. The problem was that every time you stopped you changed direction whether you wanted to or not! I think he wore those shoes twice! One thing I would like is a baseball cap with a built-in radio so you can listen to sport all day with your hands free. While we are on the subject of sport, the Americans invented a kind of robot for sports fans.

{"answer": 2, "choices": ["Popular Inventions Today", "Technology and Invention", "Inventions with a Difference", "The History of Invention"], "question": "There are some very good inventions which, for one reason or another, don't become popular. These inventions should be better known, even though I think that some of them are crazy. Let's have a look at some of these inventions and see if you agree that they should be more successful. The Australians had a great idea to stop people from drinking and driving. The idea was that if a driver wanted to start the car, she or he would have to blow into a bag first. If there was too much alcohol   in their breath, the car wouldn't start. It sounded like a great idea to me, but people said that they might need to drive the car in an emergency   even if they had drunk too much alcohol. Another idea I liked was an invention by a scientist who thought his children watched too much TV. He connected the TV to an exercise bike so that the electricity to power the TV was produced by the bike. If the children wanted to watch a lot of TV, they had to pedal   very hard. I found another invention on the Internet which encouraged good habits. Believe it or not, this invention was an ashtray   which spoke to you when you lit a cigarette! The \"voice\" of the ashtray was started by the heat from the cigarette and reminded you how dangerous it is to smoke. One of the strangest inventions I have come across is a bicycle which can cross rivers! The idea was that when you came to a river, you could _ a huge plastic ball all around the bike. You would then get into the ball which would float on the river while you pedaled the bike inside the ball! Why not use a bridge instead? A friend of mine at school once bought a strange pair of football shoes. On the bottom of the shoes there was a rotating pad of studs  . The idea was that you would change direction more quickly if the studs rotated with you. The problem was that every time you stopped you changed direction whether you wanted to or not! I think he wore those shoes twice! One thing I would like is a baseball cap with a built-in radio so you can listen to sport all day with your hands free. While we are on the subject of sport, the Americans invented a kind of robot for sports fans. If you were watching your team on TV on your own, you could press a button and the robot would do \"high fives\" with you! Fantastic! I wonder if you have any good ideas for inventions like these.

One such expression is to touch all bases. There are four bases in baseball - first, second, third and home plate. When a baseball player hits the ball, he must run to each base - in order - and touch it with his foot. It is the only way to get a point. If the player hits the ball and fails to touch all the bases, the point will not be counted. The importance of touching all the bases was shown at the start of the 1974 baseball seasons. Hank Aaron was a player with the Atlanta Braves team. He was trying to find the record for hitting the most home runs  . Aaron needed just one home run to be well matched with the record held by Babe Ruth, the greatest hitter in baseball history. Aaron got that home run the very first time he had a chance to hit the ball. That gave him 714 home runs - the same as Babe Ruth. After that day, baseball fans held their breath every time when it was Hank Aaron's turn to hit. When would he hit home run number 715? The wait was not long.

Wu Kongju,Breeder,Chengdu Panda Breeding Base,said,\"When the Wenchuan earthquake happened on May 12,2008,we were unprepared and had a shortage of bamboo.But we've been able to handle this earthquake event more smoothly.There are no problems with the food supply.\" How did the Panda Breeding Base deal with the food supply after the earthquake in Wenchan in 2008?", "subject": ""}

It turns out that feeding kids carrots is just one of a number of things to keep eyes healthy. Other things include regular eye exams, and sunglasses or hats are also very helpful, experts say. While eye disease is sometimes hereditary , some are still preventable , said Dr. Ron Weber, an Atlanta-based ophthalmologist.

Recent support has come from a study in which people with a higher level of education were more likely to have nearsightedness, because they spend more time reading or working on computers. Another study showed that children who spend more time outdoors are less likely to become nearsighted. But these findings don't mean kids should be stopped from reading or working on the computer.

There was a picture that showed a boat in full sail on a river. \"But according to the famous line from the poem, feng zheng yifan xuan, the sail shouldn't be spread ,\" said Zhang Jiayi, Li's classmate. To get the right answer, the students turned to their Chinese teacher, Liu Yan. Liu and the students looked up books, searched on the Internet and made sure that the People's Education Press had really made a mistake about the picture. The students wrote a letter to them about the mistake. \"I think my students did a right thing but I never expected a reply,\" said Liu. \"I took it as a way of letting them know the importance of spirit of questioning.\" To their surprise, one month later, they got the reply from Gu Zhenbiao, the expert of Chinese textbooks in middle schools.

{"answer": 1, "choices": ["The coffee in these places was too expensive.", "The style of the coffee stores seems the same.", "People like to drink coffee at home with friends.", "There were too many coffee shops in one place."], "question": "Although people everywhere seem to enjoy drinking coffee, they don't all have the same coffee culture. In Europe, for example, coffee shops are common places for people to meet friends and to talk while they drink coffee. On the other hand, places like this were not as common in North America in the past. Instead, people in North America liked to drink coffee in their homes with friends. The coffee culture in the USA changed when Starbucks  coffee shops spread across the country. The first Starbucks coffee shop opened in 1971 in downtown Seattle, Washington, in the USA. It was a small coffee shop that cooked its own coffee beans. The coffee shop's business did well, and by 1981 there were three Starbucks stores in Seattle. Things really began to change for the company in 1981.That year, Howard Schultz met the three men who _ Starbucks. Schultz worked in New York for a company that made kitchen equipment. He noticed that Starbucks ordered a large number of special coffee makers, which caused his great interest. Schultz went to Seattle to see what Starbucks did. In 1982, the original Starbucks owners hired Schultz as the company's head of marketing . In 1983, Schultz traveled to Italy. The special environment of the espresso( ) bars there caught his eyes. Back in the USA, Schultz created an environment for Starbucks coffee shops that was comfortable and casual, and customers everywhere seemed to like it. Starbucks began opening more stores across the USA. Then the company opened coffee shops in other countries as well. Today, there are more than 16,000 Starbucks coffee shops all over the world. However, that does not mean Starbucks has not had problems. In fact, many Starbucks stores have closed over the past few years. On the one hand, this is because there were too many coffee shops competing for business in one small area. On the other hand, stores in some countries closed because the coffee culture there did not match with the \"feel the same everywhere\" environment offered by Starbucks. Why did so many Starbucks close in small areas?", "subject": ""}

Or perhaps you've been told sleep is good for you. Yet no one knows exactly why or how people sleep. Until the early 1950s, most scientists thought the body and brain rested during sleep. Then a scientist watched people sleep. He noticed that during periods of between 5 and 30 minutes each, sleepers' eyes made rapid movements, as if they were watching something. He called these periods REM sleep, for Rapid Eye Movement. Periods when sleepers' eyes did not move he called non-REM sleep. Whenever the scientist woke people during REM sleep, they were having vivid dreams. Measurements showed that sleepers' pulses went up quickly during REM sleep. Their breathing, heartbeat, and the blood going to the brain also increased. Far from being a time of rest, REM sleep is a time when the body is hard at work.

{"answer": 1, "choices": ["Communicating Plants and Terrible Diseases", "Talking Plants and Friendly Warnings", "Protecting Plants and Clear Information", "Growing Plants and Mysterious Chemicals"], "question": "We often consider plants as the furniture of the natural world. They don't move; they don't make sounds;they don't seem to act on anything. But as is often the case, plants talk to each other all the time. And the language is a chemical  . Over the years, scientists have reported that different types of plants, from trees to tomatoes, give out chemicals into the air to help neighbouring plants. These chemical warnings can spread information about one plant's disease or infestation  ,so other plants can protect themselves. But how plants receive and act on the information exactly is still mysterious  . In this week's Science Magazine, researchers in Japan offered some explanations. They have found out one chemical message and traced it all the way from beginning to end. The scientists looked at tomato plants infested by a common pest  . To start out,they grew plants in two separate plastic spaces connected by a tube  . One plant was infested and placed upwind and the other was uninfested and placed downwind. The downwind plants were later exposed  to the pest. The results showed that plants near sick neighbours before were able to protect themselves better against the pest. They found one chemical appeared more often in the exposed plants. The chemical is called HexVic. The scientists discovered where HexVic came from, and put it over healthy plants. Those plants were then able to produce HexVic. Researchers made sure that uninfested plants could fight off bugs and diseases. How do they know when to protect themselves? They are warned first by their friendly plant neighbours. It is not a simple story , and it may be happening in many other plants besides tomatoes. It may also be happening with more chemical signals that are still unknown to us. In a word, we know that plants not only communicate, but also look out for one another.

{"answer": 3, "choices": ["20", "25", "40", "65"], "question": "The morning was cold and clear. A yellow bus came around the corner and stopped near a wood  . A coach asked the students to get off the bus. Girls began to gather by the starting line. One of them is a young, little girl. She had prepared for this running race for the whole summer. She looked around at the other girls, noticing how she was different. There was a break in the silence, and everyone started to run. After about twenty-five minutes, every runner finished the race except the girl. She was still running for the next forty minutes. As she came near the finishing line, she saw her parents, classmates and the coach. They shouted her name and told her not to stop until the end. The sweat   was flowing down her face. She kept on running until she crossed the line. I was that girl, and that was the first time I had finished a cross-country race  .

Doctor Marescaux did the operation in an office in New York City last month, while a sixty-eight-year-old woman patient was in a hospital in Strasbourg, France. A doctor in Strasbourg got the patient ready. He placed medical tools and a small video camera in her stomach area. Doctor Marescaux in New York watched the patient on a video screen.

His grandson often came in the evening to sit on his knee and asked the many questions that children would ask. One day the grandson came to his grandfather with a look of anger on his face and the following story. \"Father and I went to the store today and because I helped him, he bought me a present---a jack-knife. I went outside to wait for father and to admire my new knife in the sunlight. Some town boys came by and saw me. They surrounded me and started saying bad things. They called me dirty and stupid and said that I should not have such a fine knife. The largest of these boys pushed me back and I fell over one of the other boys. I dropped my knife and one of them picked it up and they all ran away laughing. I hate them. I hate them all.\" The elder Cherokee, with eyes that had seen too much, lifted his grandson's face so his eyes looked into the boy's face. Grandfather said, \"Let me tell you a story. I, too, at times, have felt a great hate for those who have taken so much with no sorrow for what they do. But hate wears you down and does not hurt your enemy. It is like drinking poison and wishing your enemy would die. I have struggled with these feelings many times. It is as if two wolves are inside me.... It is a terrible fight. One wolf is good and does no harm. He lives in harmony with all around him and does not take offense when no offense was intended. It will only fight when it is right to do so and in the right way. This wolf stands for joy, peace, love, hope, sharing, modesty, kindness, friendship, sympathy, generosity, truth, and faith. The other wolf is full of anger. The least thing will set off his fiercest temper. He fights everyone, all the time, for no reason. He cannot think because his anger and hate are so much. It is helpless anger, for his anger will change nothing. This wolf represents fear, envy, greed, self-pity, guilt, lies, false pride and superiority. Sometimes, it is hard to live with these two wolves inside me for both of them try to control my spirit. This same fight is going on inside you and inside every other person too.\" The boy looked into his grandfather's eyes and asked, \"Which wolf will win?\" The old Cherokee simply replied.... \"The one you feed.\" How does the good wolf do things in the story?", "subject": ""}
