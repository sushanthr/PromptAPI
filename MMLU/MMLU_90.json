{"answer": 3, "choices": ["In Facebook.", "In Seastead Institute .", "In PayPal.", "In Google."], "question": "Ever thought of moving to a new country? How about starting a new country? Patri Friedman is planning to do just that. He left Google years ago to set up the Seasteading Institute. And his dream is to build seasteads-----floating micro-nations in the middle of the ocean. So, what will life on a seastead be like? Probably a bit like life on a cruise liner  , but much larger, with shops, gyms, swimming pools, schools and other areas. In fact, the early seasteads may actually be specially-rebuilt cruise liners. But as science advances, Friedman believes they'll become more like floating cities, with several hundred people. Seasteading raises a lot of questions. First of all, how will the new countries make money? The Seasteading Institute has suggested several money-making ideas, including ocean-based theme parks, casinos   and fish farming. There's also the questions of safety. With storms, typhoons and pirates   , the high seas are a dangerous place. However, the Institute says that it can stand bad weather and prevent crimes with its well-designed systems. So, is this just a day dream? Well, maybe not. One of the people behind the project is Peter Thiel. He founded PayPal and was one of the first investors   in Facebook. So far, he's donated $ 500,000 to the project. And Friedman isn't wasting any time. He recently announced the creation of the Poseidon Award.

No matter what your age is, you can feel stressed out by things that are happening in your life. Teenagers, however, have many more opportunities to get stressed than people in any other age group. Being a teenager is hard. You are not a child any more, but you are not an adult, even though you have to deal with some very grown-up problems and decisions. Families can be one of the biggest causes of stress, such as problems with parents arguing at home or problems with brothers and sisters. Teenagers also have a lot of stress from school, either from their teachers or from their friends. Some teenagers also feel stressed about choosing their education after high school. Getting a place at university can be very difficult and some cannot afford to go to university. The stress about getting a job when finishing school is hard for some teenagers. There are so many young people finishing school and not enough jobs for them. Sadly, there is nothing we can do to remove these causes of stress from the 1ives of teenagers, but you can learn the best way to deal with it. Talking to people is one of the best ways to deal with stress. It may sound simple, but it is true. A problem shared is a problem halved.

{"answer": 2, "choices": ["Running", "Biting", "Lying down", "Sleeping"], "question": "According to some predictions, human beings will die out in 2012. Nearly all people think it's impossible, but there are some more earthquakes in recent years. Animals can predict the weather or other natural events. It may sound strange, but farmers living in the countryside think so. For hundreds of years , they have observed animals. \"Animals ' behavior can be connected to future weather conditions or events.\" They say. For example, if cows lie down, a rainstorm is coming. There are many traditional stories connecting animals and natural events. Many people think that these stories don't have scientific evidence(  ) at all. Scientists, however, are beginning to take another look at some of these ideas. A Japanese earthquake researcher named Kiyoshi Shimamura noticed an increase in dog bites a short time before earthquake hit. Then he did research on twelve public health centers in Kobe, Japan. These health centers treated people after the 1995 earthquake . He got some interesting information about the month before the big earthquake:  treatment for animals' bites had increased . In fact, aggressive behavior in dogs, such as biting and barking loudly , jumped 60 percent. There are also other changes in animals' behavior before the earthquake. For example, fish began swimming together in large groups , but only in the middle of the water and not near the edges. Birds flew away from their nests for many days, leaving their eggs unprotected . These animals' behavior suggests that animals may be able to predict natural events better than people.

For example, fish began swimming together in large groups , but only in the middle of the water and not near the edges. Birds flew away from their nests for many days, leaving their eggs unprotected . These animals' behavior suggests that animals may be able to predict natural events better than people.

{"answer": 3, "choices": ["Breakfast", "Lunch.", "The afternoon tea.", "dinner."], "question": "There is a famous saying in the West: Eat breakfast like a king. It means breakfast should be the most important meal of your day. Why? The answer is in the word breakfast itself. Breakfast means \"breaking of the fast \". There are about twelve hours between dinner and breakfast, so it's important to eat breakfast to keep in good health. Also, the food for breakfast will give you what you need in the day. Eating a good breakfast is important, but not many people are changing their eating habits. In the USA, about 60% of people have their main meal in the evening. For most Japanese and Australians, the evening meal is the main meal of the day, too. In Mexico, the main meal for many families is usually at 2:00 pm. In Switzerland, the main meal is also in the middle of the day. Many nutritionist  say people should eat small, low-fat meals five or six times  a day.

{"answer": 3, "choices": ["China", "Japan", "America", "Vietnam"], "question": "Now, I'm studying in the US. I find there are some differences between schools in the US and in Vietnam. One big difference is the clothes students wear at school and how they look. In my country, all the students should wear uniforms when they go to school. Boys aren't allowed to have long hair. Girls aren't allowed to have long or colored nails . Another difference is about the rules for parents. In Vietnam, when we begin a new school year, our parents have to go to a meeting in our class. If they don't go to that meeting, their children won't have a grade or a report card from school. However, in the US, there aren't such strict rules above. In Vietnam, a class is only 45 minutes and we have only five classes each weekday. When the bell rings, the students just sit in their own classroom. They can't move to a different one, but students can in the US. In Vietnam, students can't go to work because they can't find a job if they're under18. But in the US, many students work after school.

Finally he can always reach the goal a few steps ahead of the other player. In the 1990s, a strategy  called WIN-WIN became widespread in the western world. Its aim is to achieve your success while giving other people some advantages, so there is no real loser. One example of using the WIN-WIN principle is the voluntary system in the US.

Very few people use both hands _ well .Most of us are right-handed. Only about five people out of a hundred are left-handed.  New-born babies can take hold of things with either of their hands, but in about two years they usually use their right hands.  Scientists don't know why this happens. Monkeys are our close relatives  in the animal world. Scientists have found that monkeys like to use one of their hands more than the other, but it can be either hand. There are as many right-handed monkeys as left-handed ones.

Then the school's hard-driving headmaster, Delores Bolton, persuaded her board to shake up the place by buying a laptop computer for each student and teacher to use, in school and at home. What's more, the board provided wireless Internet access at school. Total cost: $2.5 million. Now, an hour before classes start, every seat in the library is taken by students who cannot wait for getting online. Fifth-grade teacher Jen Friday talks about different kinds of birds as students view them at a colorful website. After school, students on buses pull laptops from backpacks to get started on homework. Since the computer arrived, enrollment is up 20%. Scores on state tests are up 35%. Indeed, school systems in rural Maine and New York City also hope to follow Arace Middle School's example.
