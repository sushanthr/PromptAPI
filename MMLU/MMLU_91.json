It was so much fun and a great education  too. Mickey Mouse, Donald Duck, Tom and Jerry were my idols . Even now I really feel that they are worth watching at any age. The problem I've found is the cartoons at present. Some of them contain something ugly. Most of the time, they show such many terrible characters with violence that you wonder what they really mean. Cartoons are supposed to be funny but they aren't. If you are expecting to teach your kids good manners and behavior, then they are the worst for your kids to watch. Kids often imitate what they see in cartoons. If your kid is a fan of such cartoons, he or she will follow his or her favorite cartoon character and try to do something extremely dangerous. Therefore, try not to let your kids watch too many today's cartoons. Make sure to keep an eye on what they are watching. What's the main idea of the passage?", "subject": ""}

NASA, the American space agency, has developed a machine that \"prints\" food. They showed a model of the printer in Austin, Texas last month. How does it work? Cartridges  filled with powdered dough , cheese, sauce, water and oil put the ingredients layer by layer onto a printer bed. The printer bed, which gets hot from below, cooks the food as it's being printed. Since most of the ingredients are powdered, they can be sent into space and stored for many years without going bad.

Your car will change even more than that in the next 10 years. One of the biggest changes is that cars will drive themselves. \"We certainly have the technology for it now.\"says Andrew Poliak of automotive technology supplier QNX.\"We expect self-driving cars to be a mainstream thing between 2020 and 2025.\" The American company Google has been working on self-driving cars for years. These cars are already on the roads in the United States and are truly self-driving. They have to steering wheels or pedals . Last week, the police ordered one of Google's cars to stop for driving too slowly on a public road. The car was not breaking any law, so no one was punished. Another American company, Tesla, added an \"Autopilot\" feature to its cars last month. With the Autopilot turned on, the vehicle drives itself. The car will speed up, slow down, _ and drive by itself. You can take over driving any time by turning the steering wheel or touching a pedal. The car uses sensors to know when driveway changing is safe and whether it should speed up or slow down. Tesla Autopilot is made for cross-country driving. It keeps you in the driveway and helps you avoid hitting other cars. It does not work well on local roads, for it will not stop at a red light or stop sign.

For this reason, it is always a good idea to be polite and cautious when writing e-mails or messages to your friends. Chinese can be a direct language, but in English, people often talk about a subject in another way. So instead of saying \"Please meet me here\" or \"Do this for me now\", English speakers usually go for indirect phrases like \"Would it be possible\", \"if you have time\" or \"It would mean a lot to me if...\" If you have a close friend, you may still run into trouble because of your jokes. If you have asked someone to do something and they need a bit more time, you might joke with him: \"What? You still haven't done it yet?

Buying a new car makes you happy. However, you will forget this feeling when the car gets old. But if you spend a week traveling, it's more possible that you'll remember the great experience, and you'll remember the feeling for a long time. A new study has found that spending money on experiences makes people happier than on _ things. For material things, it's possible that you'll care about every little thing. If you buy a nice pen, and someone else buys one with less money, it's possible that you may be unhappy because you spend so much money. When it comes to experiences like trips, you won't think like that. If the experience is generally good, you will be happy with the price. Material things can be compared more easily. If you buy an MP3 and then see a more suitable one, you may regret buying the first one. However, if you have a nice dinner at one restaurant, and then learn about another better restaurant, you'll not regret the first meal. Material things can cause jealousy .For example, if you buy a new toy and find that your friend has a better toy, you'll feel unhappy. Instead, if you travel to a beautiful place, then no matter where your friends have gone, it won't make the memory of your trip less happy.

Soon a new kind of protection will be used--robots. Engineers have been working on the first mobile robots for businesses. The robots will guard factories, warehouses and museums at night. The mobile robots will move around slowly on wheels. They will be able to detect(,) people through walls and pick up sounds, such as breaking glass. They can be fixed with loud sirens to frighten thieves, or radios to signal police or guards. To protect a building, a robot will have to move around without knocking into the walls. Information about the building will have to be stored in the robot's small, built-in computer. A floor map could be programmed into the computer's memory, for example. A mobile robot will not be able to do everything. Unlike human guards, it will not be able to climb stairs, open doors, or move along rough ground. It won't be able to tell the difference between friends and enemies. Because of that, people will have to be prevented from entering the area it moves. One kind of mobile robot will be able to \"sense\" whether a chair or a box has been moved and go around it. This robot will also judge size well enough so that it won't send an alarm if a cat crosses the room. And if someone tries to steal this robot, it will sound a loud, painful siren.

The mobile robots will move around slowly on wheels. They will be able to detect(,) people through walls and pick up sounds, such as breaking glass. They can be fixed with loud sirens to frighten thieves, or radios to signal police or guards. To protect a building, a robot will have to move around without knocking into the walls. Information about the building will have to be stored in the robot's small, built-in computer. A floor map could be programmed into the computer's memory, for example. A mobile robot will not be able to do everything. Unlike human guards, it will not be able to climb stairs, open doors, or move along rough ground. It won't be able to tell the difference between friends and enemies. Because of that, people will have to be prevented from entering the area it moves. One kind of mobile robot will be able to \"sense\" whether a chair or a box has been moved and go around it. This robot will also judge size well enough so that it won't send an alarm if a cat crosses the room. And if someone tries to steal this robot, it will sound a loud, painful siren. The three-foot-tall robot is hard to be stolen anyway. It weighs about 200 pounds. U.S. companies pay almost $10 billion a year to protect their property with alarm systems and human guards. Mobile robots may be cheaper. How will a robot get directions for moving around a building?", "subject": ""}

El Nino is a huge area of warm water in the middle of cold water in the Pacific Ocean. It happens every two to seven years.

They may know the rules correctly, but they are unable to use them to work out practical problems. It is important to give children choices. From the earliest age, children should be allowed to make decisions and understand their results. Even if it's choosing between two kinds of food for lunch, decision-making helps thinking skills. As children grow older, parents should let their children decide how to use their time or spend their money, but not help them too much if they make the wrong decision. The child may have a hard time, but that is all right. This is because the most important character of creative people is a very strong desire   to find a way out of trouble.

{"answer": 3, "choices": ["Unforgettable Experiences.", "Unbelievable Imagination.", "Touching Companions.", "Lifelong Friendship."], "question": "When it comes to friends, I desire those who will share my happiness, who has wings of their own and who will fly with me. When I was in the eighth grade, I had a friend. We were shy and \"too serious\" about our studies when it was becoming fashionable with our classmates to learn acceptable social behaviors. We said little at school, but she would come to my house and we would sit down with pencils and paper, and one of us would say, \"Let's start with a train whistle today.\" We would sit quietly together and write separate poems or stories that grew out of a train whistle. Then we would read them aloud. At the end of that school year, we, too, were changing into social persons and the stories and poems stopped. When I lived for a time in London, I had a friend. He was in despair and I was in despair, too. But our friendship was based on the idea in each of us that we would be sorry later if we did not travel over this great city because we had felt bad at the time. We met every Sunday for five weeks and found many excellent things. We walked until our despairs disappeared and then we parted. _ . For almost four years I have had a great friend whose imagination brightens mine. We write long letters in which we often discover our strangest selves. Each of us appears, sometimes in a funny way, in the other's dreams. She and I agree that, at certain times, we seem to be parts of the same mind. It is such comforting companions I wish to keep. One bright hour with their kind is worth more to me than the lifetime services of a psychologist, who will only fill up the healing silence necessary to those darkest moments in which I would rather be with my own best friend.

Now we know that getting along with other people is something that we can work at. It is possible to act in such a way that other people will like us better. One way is being unselfish, not wanting everything from our friends. Another way is to look for good points, not bad points in other people. It is surprising how successful this treasure hunt can be. You do not have to be spineless   in order to be popular. In fact, you will be liked or loved if you are not afraid to stand up for your rights  . But do it politely and pleasantly. Being friendly and polite to your group, to other people and to strangers and especially to those who do not look important or do not interest you is one way to develop a good character. You cannot expect to be perfect, and you must learn not to be unhappy when you make mistakes. Everyone makes mistakes, and no one is to be blamed if he does not refuse to learn from them. Many young people become discouraged   when they know in themselves qualities that they do not like--selfishness, laziness, and other unpleasant qualities. Just remember that we all have some of these faults   and have to fight against them. At the same time, it is important to remember that while you are probably no worse than others, the best way to be happy is to think yourself above other people. When something is wrong, it is good sense to try to make it right. Perhaps you do not like a teacher or a classmate. Try to see why, and look at yourself, too, to be sure that you are not doing anything to make that person dislike you. Some day, things may turn out all right when you have to learn to get along the best with the situation, without thinking too much about it. Worrying never helps in a situation you cannot change.

His friend passed him his first cigarette. He has now been smoking for more than 30 years. It's a classic example of how young people are introduced to cigarettes, except that nowadays smokers develop their habit at an even younger age. It has become a major concern  in China that many teenagers begin to smoke. A survey showed that 22.5% of the middle school students questioned had tried smoking and 15.8% of them smoked regularly. For many teenagers, smoking is a symbol of being an adult, independence, maturity  and attractiveness because the images who they love best often smoke on screen. The social environment also plays an important role in attracting teenagers to smoking. They are used to seeing their elders, especially male family members, smoking at home. Many of them _ adult behavior and become new smokers. To increase the price of cigarettes is an effective way to reduce the number of young smokers, as teenagers have limited money to spend on them. Another way is to educate the teenagers to voluntarily refuse cigarettes. A survey shows that 92.5% of the students know smoking will be bad for their health. If we persuade them in a proper way, most of them may give up smoking. All in all, the society, the government, the school and the family should join together to take the responsibility for an anti-smoking   campaign aimed at teenagers, _ What's the main idea of this passage?", "subject": ""}

If you go shopping for food before lunchtime, you'll probably buy more than you plan to. Unfortunately, however, just this advice isn't enough for shoppers these days. Modern shoppers need an education in how and how not to buy things at the store. First, you check the weekly newspaper ads. Find out the items that are on sale and decide if you really need these things. In other words, don't buy anything just because it's cheaper than usual! Second, never let \"New and Improved!\" or \"All Natural\" on the front of a package influence you. Instead, read the list of contents on the back. Third,compare prices: that is, you should examine the prices of both different brands and different sizes of the same brand. Another suggestion for shoppers is to buy ordinary items instead of famous brands. Ordinary items in supermarkets come in plain packages. These products are cheaper because producers don't spend much money on packing or advertising. However, they are still of high quality. In the same way, in buying clothes, you can often find high quality and low prices in brands that are not famous. Shopping in discount clothing stores can help you save a lot of money. Although these stores aren't very attractive, and they usually do not have individual dressing rooms, not only are the prices low, but you can often find the same famous brands that you find in high-priced department stores. Wise shoppers read magazine ads and watch TV commercials ,but they do this with one advantage: knowledge of the psychology behind the ads.

If you decide to do your homework right after school, you may get something to eat before going to work. Always do your homework before you get too tired. Don't wait until very late in the evening, or your work will seem much harder than it really is. If you have more than an hour's work, give yourself a break after an hour. On the other hand don't break it up so much that you can't get anything down. You should be able to work at least a half at a time without stopping. Don't put it off until the last minute. If you put off doing your homework, you will have it on your mind, and you won't enjoy your free time so much.
