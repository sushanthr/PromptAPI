But designer Mikhail Belyaev doesn't think that forgetting to check the weather report before going out should cause you to get wet in the rain. That's why he created the Lampbrella--a lamp post  with its own \"umbrella\". The designer says he came up with the idea after watching people get wet on streets in Russia. \"Once, I was driving on a central Saint Petersburg street and saw people trying to hide from the rain under the street lamps. I thought it would be a good idea to have a Lampbrella built into a street lamp.\" he said. The Lampbrella is a street lamp fitted with an umbrella canopy . It has an inside electric motor  which can open or close the umbrella freely. The Lampbrella will offer people cover whenever it starts raining. After three minutes of not being used the canopy is closed. According to the designer, the Lampbrella would move at a very low speed in order not to cause harm to people. What's more, it would be grounded to protect from a possible lightning hit. Each Lampbrella would offer enough cover for several people. Being 2 meters off the ground, it would only be a danger for the tallest man.

As time passed by, the potatoes went bad and smelt nasty . They all tried to get rid of them. Too often we think of tolerance  as a gift to other people, and clearly it is for ourselves!

He owned a large field and wanted to make it a forest. The good doctor had some interesting ideas about planting trees. He never watered his new trees. Once I asked why. He said that watering plants spoiled them, and that if you watered them, each baby tree would grow weaker and weaker, so you had to make things difficult for them and pick out the weaker trees early on. He talked about how watering trees made for shallow roots, and how trees that weren't watered had to grow deep roots in search of water under the earth by themselves. Deep roots were very important. So he never watered his trees. He'd planted an oak and, instead of watering it every morning, he'd beat it with a rolled-up newspaper. I asked him why he did that, and he said it was to get the tree's attention. Dr. Gibbs died several years after I left home. Every now and then, I walked by his house and looked at the trees that I watched him plant about twenty-five years ago. They're very big and strong now. I planted some trees a few years back and carried water to them for whole summer. After two years of caring too much, whenever a cold wind blows in, they shake a lot.

But how many of us know the history of the Internet? Many people are surprised when they find that the Internet was set up in the 1960s. At that time, computers were large and expensive. Computer networks didn't work well. If one computer in the network broke down, then the whole network stopped. So a new network system  had to be set up. It should be good enough to be used by many different computers. If part of the network was not working, information could be sent through another part. In this way computer network system would keep on working all the time .  At first the Internet was only used by the government  , but in the early 1970s; universities, hospitals and banks were allowed to use it, too. However, computers were still very expensive and yet Internet was difficult to use. By the start of the 1990s, computers became cheaper and easier to use. Scientists had also developed   software   that made \"surfing\" the Internet easier. Today it is easy to get online and it is said that millions of people use the Internet every day. Sending e-mail is more and more popular among young people. The Internet has become one of the most important parts of people s life. What can we infer  from the last sentence ?", "subject": ""}

Asteroids are bigger versions of the meteoroids  that race across the night sky. Most orbit the sun far from Earth and don't threaten us. But there are also thousands of asteroids whose orbits put them on a collision course with Earth. But $500 million worth of new telescopes right now, then spend $10 million a year for the next 25 years to locate most of the space rocks.

{"answer": 0, "choices": ["56.", "50.", "39.", "37."], "question": "Lee Kuan Yew, former prime minister  of Singapore, died on Monday, March 23, 2015, at the age of 91, according to a statement released by the Prime Minister's Office.

He co-founded the People's Action Party (PAP), which has ruled Singapore since 1959 and led the newly born country when it was separated from Malaysia in 1965. In Beijing's eyes, Lee Kuan Yew, the late founding father and leader of Singapore, was not only \"an old friend of the Chinese people\", but also \"the founder of China-Singapore relations\", according to China's previous official news releases about his visits. Chinese media estimated that he had been to China more than 20 times, and he was known for his good personal relations with China's top figures, especially former leader Deng Xiaoping. Zhang Jiuhuan, the Chinese ambassador  to Singapore from 2000 to 2004, noted that \"it was a _ case\" at the time that a foreign prime minister would visit China, as Lee did in 1976, in the absence of diplomatic relations  between the two nations. Deng then paid back the visit, going to Singapore in 1978, in what Zhang described as a sensational trip. Jin Canrong, a professor of international relations at Renmin University of China in Beijing, noted that Lee's No 1 contribution to China was his efforts in \"sharing Singapore's successful experience in governance\", adding that \"China has benefited a lot\" from this. The China-Singapore Suzhou Industrial Park, inaugurated in February 1994 in Jiangsu province in East China, was proposed by Lee, who even went to the city in 1992 to inspect the site for the park.

His friend passed him his first cigarette . He has now been smoking for more than 30 years. It's an example of how young people are introduced to cigarettes,except that nowadays smokers develop their habit at an even younger age. It has become a main worry in China that many teenagers begin to smoke. A showed that 22. 5 % of the middle school students questioned had tried smoking and 15. 8% of them smoked regularly . For many teenagers, smoking is a symbol of being an adult,maturity   and attractiveness because the images who they love best often smoke on screen. The social environment also plays an important role in attracting teenagers, to smoking. They are used to seeing their elders, especially male  family members, smoking at home. Many of them imitate adult behavior and become new smokers. To increase the price of cigarettes is a useful way to reduce the number of young smokers, as teenagers have no enough money to spend on them. Another way is to teach the teenagers to refuse cigarettes. A survey shows that 92. 5% of the students know smoking will be bad for their health. If we tell them, in a proper way, most of them may give up smoking. All in all, the society, the government, the school and the family should join together to take the responsibility for an anti-smoking act aimed at teenagers,not just to put empty words and warnings on cigarette packs.

One day after school, I went into the library with my mom for my first tutoring time. I had no idea who was tutoring me. My mom practically had to pull me into the library. The first thing we did was to play a game to get to know each other and get rid of the awkwardness (,). We didn't even play a reading game. We also went around the library and I got to pick out a book I wanted to read. She didn't make me read a boring textbook about something I didn't care about. I didn't even pick a book. I picked out a magazine about remote control cars. I thought to myself, how bad could it be? I got to read about remote control cars. She told me even though I was reading a magazine, I was still reading. After the first magazine, she picked out a book she liked. I would read a chapter  and then she would read a chapter to me, this way I didn't have to read for long periods of time. As I got better and faster at reading, I was able to read two chapters in the same amount of time, which used to take me to read one chapter.
