But a new study tells that calling attention to the words and letters on the book may lead to better readers. The two-year study compared children who were read to this way in class with children who were not. Those whose teachers most often discussed the words showed clearly higher skills in reading, spelling and understanding. Shayne Piasta, a professor of teaching and learning at Ohio State University, says most preschool teachers would need only a small change in the way they teach. They already read storybooks in class. The only difference would be increased attention to the printed words. Ms. Piasta says if you get children to pay attention to letters and words, _ that they will do better at word spelling. But she says studies show that very few parents and teachers do this in a systematic way. They watched more than three hundred children aged four and five in classrooms in Ohio and Virginia.

She checks your fever, looks at your throat, and asks what you've been thinking about lately. When you leave, she gives you some medicine, but also a list of thinking skills that you are supposed to practice daily. She says that the way you think is causing some of your illness. Doctors and other scientists who study the human mind and try to explain why people act in the way that they do, called psychologists  , are starting to believe it. You know that your brain   is connected to every part of your body through your nervous system  . Now scientists have proved that how you think and feel can have an influence on the health of your body. Stress is caused whenever there is a problem or a change in your life. Of course, everybody has stress more or less; nobody's life is perfect. In fact, stress is necessary. Without stress, we would never learn anything or grow or change. We would probably be bored to death. But too much stress can hurt you. It can weaken your body's protection so that you are more likely to catch diseases. It can even make you more likely to have an accident. When you feel stressed, your brain sends a message to your body to produce a chemical called adrenaline  . Adrenaline speeds up your breathing and your heartbeat. Today you have a different kind of stress. Problems like endless homework or troubles with your family are the kind of things you can't fight or run away from, so you don't use up all that adrenaline. It just stays bottled up inside you, and that's what can do something bad to you. What can you do about stress? First, you can try to find ways to change things so you aren't under so much stress. You can set up a plan to finish homework or go to a doctor or a psychologist to try to work things out with your family or your friends. But sometimes you can't change a stressful situation. Sometimes you don't even want to. _  The link   between your body and brain works in two ways. Your body can help your mind deal with stress. If you are under stress, you need to take especially good care of your body. It's important to get enough sleep and eat nutritious   meals. Some people take a vitamin-mineral pill every day. Another thing that you can do is daily exercise. If you go walking or do aerobic dancing or work out at the gym  , you give your body a chance to burn up some of that adrenaline. Of course, a person who isn't used to much physical activity should start slowly. Anyone with a continuing physical problem should check with a doctor before starting any exercise programs.

If I have learned anything in my 16 years, it is that communication is very important, both when you disagree and when you get along. With any relationship, you need to let other person know how you are feeling. If you are not able to communicate, you _ .When you are mad at your parents, or anyone else, not talking to them doesn't solve anything. Communication begins with the concerns   of another. It means that you can't just come home from school, go up to your room and take no notice to anyone. Even if you just say \"Hi\", and see how their day was for five minutes, it is better than nothing. If you looked up the word \"communication\" in a dictionary, it would say \"the exchange of ideas, the conveyance  of information, correspondence  , means of communication: a letter or a message\". To keep a good relationship, you must keep communication strong. Let people know how you feel, even if it's just by writing a note. When dealing with parents, you always have to make them feel good about how they are doing as a parent. If you are trying to make them see something as you see it, tell them that you'll listen to what they have to say, and ask them politely to listen to you. Shouting or walking away only makes the situation worse. Here is an example: one night, Sophie went to a street party with her friends. She knew she had to be home by midnight after the fireworks, but she didn't feel she could just ask to go home. That would be rude. After all, they had been nice enough to take her along with them. Needless to say, she was late getting home. Her parents were mad at first, but when Sophie explained why she was late, they weren't as mad and let it go. Communication is the key here. If Sophie's parents had not been willing to listen, Sophie would have been in a lot of trouble. Communication isn't a one-way matter: it goes both ways.

In Britain the government has made several laws to reduce noise.Though the government has spent a lot of money in making airports and main roads quieter,many people think that there are still not enough laws.For example,there are no laws to control the noise of machines.In Japan,America and Norway there are such laws.As a result,workers can be given compensation if they become deaf. Who can be given compensation if they become deaf?", "subject": ""}

Here are some tips for you to be happy. Make enough money to meet your basic needs: food, shelter, and clothing. In the US, that magic number is $40,000 a year. Any money you make beyond that will not necessarily make you happier. Once you make enough money to support your basic needs, your happiness is not affected by how much money you make.  _  Or move to where other members are-so you can see them more. Now, people follow jobs around the country and sometimes around the world. As a result, our relationships with our friends and family have a far greater impact   on our happiness than our jobs do. So next time you think about moving, consider a place where most of your friends and families live. Find happiness in the job you have now. Many people expect   the right job to change their level of happiness. But happiness research makes it clear that changing jobs can't bring you happiness. If you want, you will make the best of any job. If you have good relationships with people, you won't depend on   your job to give your life a greater sense of meaning.

People who are always very sad have depression  ; those who worry a lot have anxiety. But what about anger problems? Anger is largely viewed as a secondary emotion - one caused by other emotions. People are thought to be angry because they are sad, anxious or stressed. In the past, many doctors didn't accept the idea that anger could be a problem all on its own. Today, though, a growing number of mental health experts think that anger is a serious problem that needs its own treatment. How to tell the difference between \"normal\" anger and \"anger problem\" is difficult. After all, everyone gets really mad from time to time. Experts point out a few ways. Disordered anger, as it is sometimes called, tends to be of greater intensity  . It takes very little to set off a person with an anger problem, and their responses   are very strong. An example: While most people would get upset if a driver cut them off, someone with disordered anger might try to chase down the car and force it off the road. And in cases of disordered anger, the person gets angry more frequently and his/her anger lasts longer. For most people, angry feelings disappear quickly. But people with anger problems often stay angry for days, weeks or even years; their feelings of anger don't disappear over time.  _ are also important to consider: Disordered anger often damages people's lives. \"It interferes   with people's relationships and their jobs,\" says Raymond Chip Tafrate, a US psychologist. \"Even their health is affected.\" Anger clearly increases the risk of certain health problems, as many studies have shown. \"When a person is angry, their heart beats faster and their blood pressure goes up,\" says Howard Kassinove, a professor at Hofstra University in New York. Over time, these changes take their toll on the body, he adds. Experts suggest that people with an anger problem take anger-management programs. The programs teach people to control their responses to stressful situations through the use of relaxation techniques.

You can read stories about men called adventurers. But they were really businessmen. There was something they wanted----- a lady, or money, or a country, or honor. And so they got it. But a true adventurer is different. He starts without any special purpose. He is ready for anything he may meet. There have been many half-adventurers. And they were great men. History is rich with their stories. But each of them had a special purpose. They were not followers of true adventure. In the big city of New York, Romance and Adventure are always waiting. As we walk along the street, they are watching us. We look up suddenly and see a face in a window. The face seems to interest us strangely. Or in a quiet street, we hear a cry of fear and pain coming from a house where no one lives. A car takes us to a strange door, instead of to our own. The door opens and we are asked to enter. At every corner, eyes look toward us, or hands are raised, or fingers point. Adventure is offered. But few of us are ready to accept. We are ready to do only the things we do every day. We wish to do only the things that everyone else does. We move on; and some day we come to the end of a long quiet life. Then we begin to think. Then, when it is too late, we are sorry that we have never known true Romance and Adventure. When do most people wish that they had known romance and adventure?", "subject": ""}
